487,INTRODUCTION  360 degrees Virtual Reality  VR  is possibly produced and sufficiently effective as a consumer-friendly VR learning medium  Therefore  it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice field  as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training during the ongoing pandemic  COVID-19   Accordingly  this study was conducted to assess 360 degrees VR self-learning media for a periodontal instrument operation  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We recruited 30 participants who had never experienced instrument training  We offered basic education and initial assessment  IA   then divided them into three groups  1  PAPER  trained only with paper handouts  2  2D  trained with 2D video  3  VR  trained with 360 degrees VR  Each group performed self-learning and mid-term assessment  MA   Subjects then implemented home self-learning with the same media for one week  which was then followed by a final assessment  FA   RESULT  Analysis of IA-to-FA improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher than the PAPER groups  Meanwhile  analysis of MA-to-FA improvement scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER group  Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different  VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score analyses  DISCUSSION  Both 2D video and 360 degrees VR training were helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods  360 degrees VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video  possibly due to its autonomy  360 degrees visual information  and physical and immersive characteristics  which positively affected self-training  CONCLUSION  Our findings showed the potential of 360 degrees VR learning media and further  suggest its usefulness as a novel self-learning method in future dental education,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000247
2647,BACKGROUND  Inflammation plays a crucial role in nutritional status and can be useful in early nutritional risk screening of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic  Thus  this study aimed to assess the association between systemic inflammatory markers and nutritional risk tools in ICU patients with COVID-19  METHODS  Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to the ICU were enrolled in a retrospective  observational  cross-sectional study  The median of C-reactive protein  CRP >  13 8 mg dL  and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio  NLR >  12 6  upon admission were used to dichotomize patients  RESULTS  Of the 73 patients  63  were men  the average age was 56 years  and the median length of hospital stay was 10  25 th    4 and 75 th    17  days  When nutrition risk screening tools were used  85  were at risk according to Nutritional Risk Screening  i e   NRS >  3   whereas 42  had high risk according to Nutrition Risk in the Critically Ill  mNUTRIC >  5   and 57  were moderately or severely malnourished according to the Subjective Global Assessment  SGA  B C   Mortality was higher in the NLR >  12 6 group than NLR<12 6  with no difference between CRP groups  A significant association was found only between NLR and mNUTRIC  even when adjusted by sex  age  and BMI  OR  1 36  95 CI 1 06-1 76  p 0 016   but not between CRP and nutritional risk  CONCLUSION  Although the inflammatory marker CRP is the most used in hospital clinical practice  we found that only NLR was associated with the nutritional risk  NUTRIC score   This article is protected by copyright  All rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961953
5697,This paper provides new evidence on the role of city planning  urban form  and built environment characteristics in health and well-being during the coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic  Based on survey and geographic information systems  GIS  data from Oslo and Viken in Norway  the paper investigates changes in health and well-being due to COVID-19 and how the compact city and its characteristics relate to these changes  Findings indicate that self-reported measures of health and well-being worsened due to COVID-19  The most substantial changes were reported for life satisfaction  anxiety  and satisfaction with leisure  personal relationships  and vacations  General health  happiness  and satisfaction with income also declined during COVID-19 in comparison with pre-COVID-19 times  Overall  residents of compact neighborhoods reported lower well-being during COVID-19 compared to residents of lower-density neighborhoods  Important compact city characteristics - higher neighborhood density  reliance on public transport  smaller dwellings  and less green space - were negatively associated with well-being and health outcomes during COVID-19  In contrast  another compact city attribute  the presence of numerous local facilities  was positively linked to well-being and health during COVID-19  Based on these findings  the paper presents possible implications for sustainable urban planning and compact cities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914991
9676,The ubiquitously-expressed proteolytic enzyme furin is closely related to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore represents a key target for antiviral therapy  Based on bioinformatic analysis and pseudovirus tests  we discovered a second functional furin site located in the spike protein  Furin still increased the infectivity of mutated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in 293T-ACE2 cells when the canonical polybasic cleavage site  682-686  was deleted  However  K814A mutation eliminated the enhancing effect of furin on virus infection  Furin inhibitor prevented infection by 682-686-deleted SARS-CoV-2 in 293T-ACE2-furin cells  but not the K814A mutant  K814A mutation did not affect the activity of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L but did impact the cleavage of S2 into S2  and cell-cell fusion  Additionally  we showed that this functional furin site exists in RaTG13 from bat and PCoV-GD GX from pangolin  Therefore  we discovered a new functional furin site that is pivotal in promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856891
1103,Background  Administration of potent anti-receptor-binding domain  RBD  monoclonal antibodies has been shown to curtail viral shedding and reduce hospitalization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  However  the structure-function analysis of potent human anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies and its links to the formulation of antibody cocktails remains largely elusive  Methods  Previously  we isolated a panel of neutralizing anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies from convalescent patients and showed their neutralization efficacy in vitro  Here  we elucidate the mechanism of action of antibodies and dissect antibodies at the epitope level  which leads to a formation of a potent antibody cocktail  Results  We found that representative antibodies which target non-overlapping epitopes are effective against wild type virus and recently emerging variants of concern  whilst being encoded by antibody genes with few somatic mutations  Neutralization is associated with the inhibition of binding of viral RBD to ACE2 and possibly of the subsequent fusion process  Structural analysis of representative antibodies  by cryo-electron microscopy and crystallography  reveals that they have some unique aspects that are of potential value while sharing some features in common with previously reported neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  For instance  one has a common VH 3-53 public variable region yet is unusually resilient to mutation at residue 501 of the RBD  We evaluate the in vivo efficacy of an antibody cocktail consisting of two potent non-competing anti-RBD antibodies in a Syrian hamster model  We demonstrate that the cocktail prevents weight loss  reduces lung viral load and attenuates pulmonary inflammation in hamsters in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings  Although neutralization of one of these antibodies is abrogated by the mutations of variant B 1 351  it is also possible to produce a bi-valent cocktail of antibodies both of which are resilient to variants B 1 1 7  B 1 351 and B 1 617 2  Conclusions  These findings support the up-to-date and rational design of an anti-RBD antibody cocktail as a therapeutic candidate against COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987630
1982,CONTEXT  The COVID-19 pandemic strongly challenged healthcare workers  disrupting their work routine and impacting on their professional life  A previous investigation explored levels of burnout and psychological morbidity among palliative care professionals  PCPs  during COVID-19 first wave  OBJECTIVE  To update data about burnout and psychological morbidity among PCPs after a year of COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  The same questionnaires on burnout  Maslach Burnout Inventory  MBI  and psychological morbidity  General Health Questionnaire 12 items  GHQ-12  were administered a year after  Differences in MBI and GHQ-12 scores obtained in the two studies  COVID2020 and COVID2021   as well as distributions of PCPs showing burnout symptoms and psychological morbidity were analyzed and compared  We also explored the association between the three dimensions of burnout and socio-demographic and professional characteristics  RESULTS  The sample consisted of 145 PCPs  59  physicians and 41  nurses   Response rate  70 4   was quite similar to the previous study  73 2    No differences were observed in the frequency of burnout between COVID2021 and COVID2020  the PCPs in COVID2021 reported marginally higher level of EE  p  049  and this result is confirmed in physicians  p  010  while no difference was observed in nurses  p  326   In addition  the percentage of cases showing psychological morbidity significantly decreased  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings show stable levels of burnout and decreasing levels of psychological morbidity among PCPs one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  However  more research is needed to detail the significance of emotional exhaustion dimension  a variable influenced by the survey,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973353

6041,The co-occurrence of COVID-19  non-communicable diseases and socioeconomic disadvantage has been identified as creating a syndemic  a state of synergistic epidemics  occurring when co-occurring health conditions interact with social conditions to amplify the burden of disease  In this study  we use the concept of illness management work to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of people living with  often multiple  chronic health conditions in a range of social circumstances  In-depth interviews were conducted between May and July 2020 with 29 participants living in a city in North East England  Qualitative data provide unique insights for those seeking to better understand the consequences for human life and wellbeing of the interacting social  physical and psychological factors that create syndemic risks in people s lives  Among this group of people at increased vulnerability to harm from COVID-19  we find that the pandemic public health response increased the work required for condition management  Mental distress was amplified by fear of infection and by the requirements of social isolation and distancing that removed participants  usual sources of support  Social conditions  such as poor housing  low incomes and the requirement to earn a living  further amplified the work of managing everyday life and risked worsening existing mental ill health  As evidenced by the experiences reported here  the era of pandemics will require a renewed focus on the connection between health and social justice if stubborn  and worsening health and social inequalities are to be addressed or  at the very least  not increased,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909754
6497,In 2020  COVID-19 threatened to overwhelm healthcare capacity  forcing policymakers to enact temporary waivers of licensing restrictions  Research finds that occupational licensing reduces the supply of professionals in a regulated field  and reduces geographic mobility  contributing to the primary care professional shortage  Scope of practice laws reduce the flexibility of practitioners  exacerbating these shortages  Given the fact that policymakers and healthcare professionals recognized the shortcomings to our current licensing regime during the COVID-19 pandemic  we should consider alternatives that still ensure quality care for patients without restricting access and reducing flexibility  We rank six alternatives currently being considered to address the primary care shortage from most to least effective  While efforts to expand the supply of physicians or NPs and PAs would be the most effective reforms to expand access to primary care  others that better utilize our existing supply of healthcare professionals are worth considering,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904135
9432,Antiphospholipid antibodies  aPL   assumed to cause antiphospholipid syndrome  APS   are notorious for their heterogeneity in targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins  The persistent presence of Lupus anticoagulant and or aPL against cardiolipin and or beta2-glycoprotein I have been shown to be independent risk factors for vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity in APS  aPL production is thought to be triggered by-among other factors-viral infections  though infection-associated aPL have mostly been considered non-pathogenic  Recently  the potential pathogenicity of infection-associated aPL has gained momentum since an increasing number of patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has been described with coagulation abnormalities and hyperinflammation  together with the presence of aPL  Here  we present data from a multicentric  mixed-severity study including three cohorts of individuals who contracted SARS-CoV-2 as well as non-infected blood donors  We simultaneously measured 10 different criteria and non-criteria aPL  IgM and IgG  by using a line immunoassay  Further  IgG antibody response against three SARS-CoV-2 proteins was investigated using tripartite automated blood immunoassay technology  Our analyses revealed that selected non-criteria aPL were enriched concomitant to or after an infection with SARS-CoV-2  Linear mixed-effects models suggest an association of aPL with prothrombin  PT   The strength of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was further influenced by SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and sex of the individuals  In conclusion  our study is the first to report an association between disease severity  anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoreactivity  and aPL against PT in patients with SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860860

457,OBJECTIVE  Our hospital experienced a hospital shutdown and quarantine for two weeks after one case of COVID-19 was diagnosed during hospitalization  We analyzed the reopening process following hospital closure and possible factors that prevented hospital spread  METHODS  We retrospectively reviewed the confirmed patient s medical records and results of epidemiological survey available from the infection control team of our hospital  RESULTS  A total of 117 hospital staff members were tested  26 of whom were self-isolated  Of the 54 inpatients tested  28 on the same floor and two close contacts in the endoscopic room were quarantined in a single room  Finally  all quarantined hospital staff  inpatients and outpatients were tested for COVID-19 on the 14th day of close contact  The results were all negative  and the hospital work completely resumed  CONCLUSION  Although closing and isolating the hospital appeared to have played a useful role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 inside the hospital and to the local community  it is still debated whether or not the duration of hospital closure or quarantine was appropriate  The lessons from the two-week hospital closure suggest that wearing a mask  hand hygiene and the ward environment are important factors in preventing nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000646
8898,This paper used Our World data for coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19  death count  test data  stringency  and transmission count and prepared a path model for COVID-19 deaths  We augmented the model with age structure-related variables and comorbidity via non-communicable diseases for 117 countries of the world for September 23  2021  on a cross-section basis  A broad-based global quantitative study incorporating these two prominent channels with regional variation was unavailable in the existing literature  Old age and comorbidity were identified as two prime determinants of COVID-19 mortality  The path model showed that after controlling for these factors  one SD increase in the proportion of persons above 65  above 70  or of median age raised COVID-19 mortality by more than 0 12 SDs for 117 countries  The regional intensity of death is alarmingly high in South America  Europe  and North America compared with Oceania  After controlling for regions  the figure was raised to 0 213  which was even higher  For old age  the incremental coefficient was the highest for South America  0 564   and Europe  0 314   which were substantially higher than in Oceania  The comorbidity channel via non-communicable diseases illustrated that one SD increase in non-communicable disease intensity increased COVID-19 mortality by 0 132 for the whole sample  The regional figure for the non-communicable disease was 0 594 for South America and 0 358 for Europe compared with the benchmark region Oceania  The results were statistically significant at a 10  level of significance or above  This suggested that we should prioritize vaccinations for the elderly and people with comorbidity via non-communicable diseases like heart disease  cancer  chronic respiratory disease  and diabetes  Further attention should be given to South America and Europe  which are the worst affected regions of the world,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869152
3999,We discuss whether and under what conditions people should be allowed to choose which COVID-19 vaccine to receive on the basis of personal ethical views  The problem arises primarily with regard to some religious groups  concerns about the connection between certain COVID-19 vaccines and abortion  Vaccines currently approved in Western countries make use of foetal cell lines obtained from aborted foetuses either at the testing stage  Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccines  or at the development stage  Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine   The Catholic Church s position is that  if there are alternatives  Catholic people have a moral obligation to request the vaccine whose link with abortion is more remote  which at present means that they should refuse the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine  We argue that any consideration regarding free choice of the vaccine should apply to religious and non-religious claims alike  in order to avoid religion-based discrimination  However  we also argue that  in a context of limited availability  considering the significant differences in costs and effectiveness profile of the vaccines available  people should only be allowed to choose the preferred vaccine if  1  this does not risk compromising vaccination strategies  and 2  they internalize any additional cost that their choice might entail  The State should only subsidize the vaccine that is more cost-effective for any demographic group from the point of view of public health strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940937
1626,BACKGROUND  Although older adults are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus  a significant proportion of them do not follow recommended guidelines concerning preventive actions during the ongoing pandemic  This paper analyses the role of biased health beliefs for adaptive health behaviour such as reduced mobility  protection in public spaces  and hygiene measures  for the population aged 50 and older in 13 European countries  METHODS  Health perception is measured based on the difference between self-reported health and physical performance tests for over 24 000 individuals included in the most recent Survey of Health  Ageing and Retirement in Europe  Logistic regressions are employed to explore how over- and underestimating health are related to preventive behaviours  RESULTS  Results suggest that older adults who underestimate their health are more likely to show adaptive behaviour related to mobility reductions  In particular  they are more likely to stay at home  shop less  and go for walks less often  By contrast  overestimating health is not significantly associated with reduced mobility  Protective behaviour in public spaces and adopting hygiene measures do not vary systematically between health perception groups  CONCLUSION  As health beliefs appear relevant for the adoption of preventive health behaviours related to mobility  they have serious consequences for the health and well-being of older Europeans  While adaptive behaviour helps to contain the virus  exaggerated mobility reduction in those who underestimate their health might be contributing to the already high social isolation and loneliness of older adults during the ongoing pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978564
9534,Background  Approval for the use of COVID-19 vaccines has been granted in a number of countries but there are concerns that vaccine uptake may be low amongst certain groups  Methods  This study used a mixed methods approach based on online survey and an embedded quantitative qualitative design to explore perceptions and attitudes that were associated with intention to either accept or refuse offers of vaccination in different demographic groups during the early stages of the UK s mass COVID-19 vaccination programme  December 2020   Analysis used multivariate logistic regression  structural text modeling and anthropological assessments  Results  Of 4 535 respondents  85   n   3 859  were willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine  The rapidity of vaccine development and uncertainties about safety were common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy  There was no evidence for the widespread influence of mis-information  although broader vaccine hesitancy was associated with intentions to refuse COVID-19 vaccines  OR 20 60  95  CI 14 20-30 30  p < 0 001   Low levels of trust in the decision-making  OR 1 63  95  CI 1 08  2 48  p   0 021  and truthfulness  OR 8 76  95  CI 4 15-19 90  p < 0 001  of the UK government were independently associated with higher odds of refusing COVID-19 vaccines  Compared to political centrists  conservatives and liberals were  respectively  more  OR 2 05  95 CI 1 51-2 80  p < 0 001  and less  OR 0 30  95  CI 0 22-0 41  p < 0 001  likely to refuse offered vaccines  Those who were willing to be vaccinated cited both personal and public protection as reasons  with some alluding to having a sense of collective responsibility  Conclusion  Dominant narratives of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are misconceived as primarily being driven by misinformation  Key indicators of UK vaccine acceptance include prior behaviors  transparency of the scientific process of vaccine development  mistrust in science and leadership and individual political views  Vaccine programmes should leverage the sense of altruism  citizenship and collective responsibility that motivated many participants to get vaccinated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858927
4863,The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been known to gain entry into the host cell through the spike protein that binds to the host ACE2 cell surface protein  However  the role of the putative sugar-binding sites in the spike protein has remained unclear  We provide a comprehensive in silico outlook into the infection initiation wherein the virus first recognizes the sialosides on the cell via its S1A domain of the spike protein as it surfs over the cell surface  This facilitates the subsequent interaction with the cellular glycosaminoglycans through the S1B domain of the spike protein as it binds to the ACE2 receptor  The unique coadaptation to recognize both the host protein and the cell-surface carbohydrate receptors provides an additional coupling mechanism for efficient viral attachment and infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928574
6363,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has a devastating impact on global populations triggered by a highly infectious viral sickness  produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The third major cause of mortality in the United States  following heart disease and cancer in 2020  was undoubtedly COVID-19  The centers for disease control and prevention  CDC  and the world health organization  WHO  separately developed a categorization system for differentiating new strains of SARS-CoV-2 into variants of concern  VoCs  and variants of interest  VoIs  with the continuing development of various strains SARS-CoV-2  By December 2021  five of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs were discovered from the onset of the pandemic depending on the latest epidemiologic report by the WHO  Alpha  B 1 1 7   Beta  B 1 351   Gamma  P 1   Delta  B 1 617 2   and Omicron  B 1 1 529   Mutations in the receptor-binding domain  RBD  and n-terminal domain  NTD  have been found throughout all five identified VoCs  All strains other than the delta mutant are often found with the N501Y mutation situated on the RBD  resulting in higher binding between the spike protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptors  enhanced viral adhesion  and following the entrance to host cells  The introduction of these new strains of SRAS-CoV-2 is likely to overcome the remarkable achievements gained in restricting this viral disease to the point where it is presented with remarkable vaccine developments against COVID-19 and strong worldwide mass immunization initiatives  Throughout this literature review  the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines for managing and prohibiting SARS-CoV-2 strains is thoroughly described,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906769

3620,The objective of this work was to evaluate the magnitude of COVID-19 spread and the related risk factors among hospital nurses employed in a COVID hospital in Rome  before the beginning of the vaccination programmes commenced in 2021  Participants periodically underwent  every 15-30 days  nasopharyngeal swab and or blood sample for SARS-CoV-2 IgG examination  From 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020  we found 162 cases of COVID-19 infection  n   143 nasopharyngeal swab and n   19 IgG-positive  in a total of 918 hospital nurses  17 6    Most SARS-CoV-2-infected hospital nurses were night shift workers  NSWs   smokers  with higher BMI and lower mean age than that of individuals who tested negative  After adjusting for covariates  age  OR   0 923  95  C I  0 895-0 952   night shift work  OR   2 056  95  C I  1 320-2 300   smoking status  OR   1 603  95  C I  1 080-2 378  and working in high-risk settings  OR   1 607  95  C I  1 036-2 593  were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 hospital infection  whereas BMI was not significantly related  In conclusion  we found a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital nurses at a Rome COVID hospital in the pre-vaccination period  Smoking  young age  night shift work and high-risk hospital settings are relevant risk factors for hospital SARS-CoV-2 infection  therefore  a close health surveillance should be necessary among hospital nurses exposed to SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948662
6706,Objectives  Venous sinus thrombosis  VST  after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine produced by Pfizer is comparatively rare and usually occurs after the first dose  VST after the second dose has been reported in only few patients  Case report  The patient is a 33yo male who experienced an episode of sudden onset focal  stabbing headache in the left temporal region for about 4 h  Three days later a similar episode occurred accompanied by a focal seizure  Twenty days before he had received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine  Clinical exam was normal but MRI of the brain revealed a VST of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses  Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin followed by dabigatran resulted in complete recovery  Conclusions  This case shows that also the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine can be followed by a VST  Currently  there are more arguments in favour of a causal relation between the vaccination and the VST than against it,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901793
379,In this study we examine the time-varying causal effect of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the major oil-importing and oil-exporting countries on the oil price changes  stock market volatilities and the economic uncertainty using the wavelet coherence and network analysis  During the period of the pandemic  we explore such relationship by resorting to the wavelet coherence and gaussian graphical model  GGM  frameworks  Wavelet analysis enables us to measure the dynamics of the causal effect of the novel covid-19 pandemic in the time-frequency space  Regarding the findings displayed herein  we first found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a severe influence on oil prices  stock market indices  and the economic uncertainty  Second the intensity of the causality effect is stronger in the longer horizon than in the short ones  suggesting that the causality exercise continues  Our findings also provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price changes in oil-importing countries mirror those in oil-exporting countries and vice versa  Further  the COVID-19 pandemic has a profound immediate time-frequency effect on the US  Japanese  South Korean  Indian  and Canadian economic uncertainties  A better understanding of oil and stock market prices in the oil-importing and oil-exporting countries is vital for investors and policymakers  specially since the novel unprecedented COVID-19 crisis has been recognized among the most serious ever happened  Thus  the findings suggest that the authorities should strongly take efficient actions to minimize risk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002002
3238,The aim of the work was to conduct a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of patients with pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus  and to determine via mathematical methods the significance of some physiological and biochemical indices as predictive markers of an unfavorable outcome of the disease  A random cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia numbered 209 people  Mathematical analysis addressed the physiological characteristics of patients recorded at the time of hospital admission  as well as blood coagulation parameters and those reflecting the development of an inflammatory reaction  The analyzed parameters were categorized relative to the reference ranges of physiologically normal values  Correlation analysis was carried out using categorical data on the disease outcome  The algorithms for calculating statistical characteristics  as well as results visualization  were programmed in Python  When comparing patient groups  the significance of differences between the determined parameters was assessed using the Pearson s chi 2  test with Yates  correction  The study showed that the age over 50 and male sex can be considered risk factors for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia  p < 0 05   The disease outcome was found to be significantly affected by cardiovascular pathologies  p < 0 01  and to a lesser extent by diabetes mellitus  p < 0 10   There were revealed maximal correlation coefficients between the oxygen saturation level  -0 43   as well as the breathing rate  0 43   and a fatal outcome of the disease  For patients over 50 years of age  oxygen saturation below 80  at the time of hospital admission turned out to be a marker of mortality  It was shown that D-dimer blood levels above 625 ng mL in patients over 80 years of age correlated with mortal outcomes  No correlation was found between the C-reactive protein  CRP  level and the disease outcome  The effect of corticosteroids on the disease outcome was analyzed in patients with different CRP levels  It was found that  while using corticosteroids  the mortality rate in patients with CRP <   12 5 mg L is 2 7 times higher than in those with CRP > 12 5 mg L  p < 0 01   Thus  the use of adequate mathematical methods made it possible to define more precisely some mortality-associated physiological and biochemical indices in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955552
2288,BACKGROUND  The importance of effective communication during public health emergencies has been highlighted by the World Health Organization  and it has published guidelines for effective communication in such situations  With video being a popular medium  video communication has been a growing area of study over the past decades and is increasingly used across different sectors and disciplines  including health  Health-related video communication gained momentum during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  and video was among the most frequently used modes of communication worldwide  However  although much research has been done regarding different characteristics of video content  the message  and its delivery  the messenger   there is a lack of knowledge about the role played by the characteristics of the recipients for the creation of effective communication  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this review is to identify how health video communication outcomes are shaped by recipient characteristics  as such characteristics might affect the effectiveness of communication  The main research question of the study is as follows  do the characteristics of the recipients of health videos affect the outcomes of the communication  METHODS  A scoping review describing the existing knowledge within the field was conducted  We searched for literature in 3 databases  PubMed  Scopus  and Embase  and defined eligibility criteria based on the relevance to the research question  Recipient characteristics and health video communication outcomes were identified and classified  RESULTS  Of the 1040 documents initially identified  128  12 31   met the criteria for full-text assessment  and 39  3 75   met the inclusion criteria  The included studies reported 56 recipient characteristics and 42 communication outcomes  The reported associations between characteristics and outcomes were identified  and the potential research opportunities were discussed  Contributions were made to theory development by amending the existing framework of the Integrated-Change model  which is an integrated model of motivational and behavioral change  CONCLUSIONS  Although several recipient characteristics and health video communication outcomes were identified  there is a lack of robust empirical evidence on the association between them  Further research is needed to understand how the preceding characteristics of the recipients might affect the various outcomes of health video communication,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967758

8236,The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare education and delivery  including both theory and practice learning  Academic staff responded rapidly to move teaching online during the first lockdown  with many returning to practice to deliver care or upskill practice staff to work in critical care  Many pre-registration students responded by becoming paid NHS employees  contributing to care delivery while remaining on their programme of study  Practice learning partners  despite the challenges of the pandemic  continued to support students to achieve their registration status  This occurred within the context of the Emergency and Recovery Standards  published by the Nursing and Midwifery Council between March 2020 and September 2021  This paper sets out the response of students  practice learning partners and higher education institutions involved in pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878903
9566,Olfactory and taste disorders  OTD  are commonly found as presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with clinically mild COVID-19  Virus-specific T cells are thought to play an important role in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2  therefore the study of T cell specific immune responses in patients with mild symptoms may help to understand their possible role in protection from severe disease  We evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses to four different peptide megapools covering all SARS-CoV-2 proteins during the acute phase of the disease in 33 individuals with mild or no other symptom beside OTD and in 22 age-matched patients with severe infection  A control group of 15 outpatients with OTD and consistently negative nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA swabs and virus-specific IgG serology was included in the study  Increased frequencies of virus-specific CD4    and CD8    T cells were found in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with OTD compared with those with severe COVID-19 and with SARS-CoV-2 negative OTD individuals  Moreover  enhanced CD4    and CD8    T-cell activation induced by SARS-CoV-2 peptides was associated with higher interferon  IFN gamma production  Increased frequencies of Spike  S1 S2 -specific CD4    T cells showing enhanced IFNgamma secretion and granzyme B content were associated with serum spike-specific IgG in the OTD group  In conclusion  patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced OTD develop highly functional virus-specific CD4    and CD8    T cells during the symptomatic phase of the disease  suggesting that robust and coordinated T-cell responses provide protection against extension of COVID-19 to the lower respiratory tract,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858405
9786,We examine how the shift toward intensive work-from-home during the Coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic has impacted the experience of interruptions during work time  We conducted a two-wave survey of 249 employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic  Building on a conceptual framework and typology  Leroy et al   2020   we examine changes in the prevalence of interruptions since-COVID-19 as a function of interruption type  intrusions  distractions  breaks  multitasking  and surprises   source  work-based vs  nonwork   and timing  pre- vs  since-COVID-19   We find a large increase in interruptions since-COVID  with the largest increases observed for nonwork intrusions  distractions  and multitasking  Women reported a greater increase in interruptions  particularly with regard to nonwork interruptions of all types  in addition to work-based intrusions  multitasking  and surprises  uncovering an important source of gender inequity  A dedicated unshared workspace at home was associated with fewer nonwork interruptions  while more nonwork responsibilities predicted more nonwork interruptions  Further differentiation of interruption types and sources was observed with regard to outcomes of interruptions  Nonwork interruptions predicted higher family-to-work interference  emotional exhaustion  and lower performance  Notably  these relationships varied meaningfully across specific interruption-type outcome combinations  highlighting the value of differentiating interruptions by type  Work-based interruptions-especially intrusions and multitasking-were associated with higher work-family interference and emotional exhaustion  as well as lower performance  The results of this study provide valuable insights to help understand and  ultimately  improve work experiences in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic while also contributing to the broader literatures on interruptions and remote work   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855421
156,Introduction  The best way to titrate the positive end-expiratory pressure  PEEP  in patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is still matter of debate  Electrical impedance tomography  EIT  is a non-invasive technique that could guide PEEP setting based on an optimized ventilation homogeneity  Methods  For this study  we enrolled the patients with 2019 coronavirus disease  COVID-19 -related acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   who required mechanical ventilation and were admitted to the ICU in March 2021  Patients were monitored by an esophageal catheter and a 32-electrode EIT device  Within 48 h after the start of mechanical ventilation  different levels of PEEP were applied based upon PEEP FiO2 tables  positive end-expiratory transpulmonary  PL   FiO2 table  and EIT  Respiratory mechanics variables were recorded  Results  Seventeen patients were enrolled  PEEP values derived from EIT  PEEPEIT  were different from those based upon other techniques and has poor in-between agreement  The PEEPEIT was associated with lower plateau pressure  mechanical power  transpulmonary pressures  and with a higher static compliance  Crs  and homogeneity of ventilation  Conclusion  Personalized PEEP setting derived from EIT may help to achieve a more homogenous distribution of ventilation  Whether this approach may translate in outcome improvement remains to be investigated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004712

7744,This article examines the main factors affecting COVID-19 lethality across 16 European Countries with a focus on the role of health system characteristics during the first phase of the diffusion of the virus  Specifically  we investigate the leading causes of lethality at 10  20  30  40 days in the first hit of the pandemic  Using a random forest regression  ML   with lethality as outcome variable  we show that the percentage of people older than 65 years  with two or more chronic diseases  is the main predictor variable of lethality by COVID-19  followed by the number of hospital intensive care unit beds  investments in healthcare spending compared to GDP  number of nurses and doctors  Moreover  the variable of general practitioners has little but significant predicting quality  These findings contribute to provide evidence for the prediction of lethality caused by COVID-19 in Europe and open the discussion on health policy and management of health care and ICU beds during a severe epidemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887452
5396,SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  also in pregnant women  Infection in pregnancy leads to maternal and placental functional alterations  Pregnant women with vascular defects such as preeclampsia show high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by undefined mechanisms  Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 show higher rates of preterm birth and caesarean delivery  and their placentas show signs of vasculopathy and inflammation  It is still unclear whether the foetus is affected by the maternal infection with this virus and whether maternal infection associates with postnatal affections  The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes oxidative stress and activation of the immune system leading to cytokine storm and next tissue damage as seen in the lung  The angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 expression is determinant for these alterations in the lung  Since this enzyme is expressed in the human placenta  SARS-CoV-2 could infect the placenta tissue  although reported to be of low frequency compared with maternal lung tissue  Early-onset preeclampsia  eoPE  shows higher expression of ADAM17  a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17  causing an imbalanced renin-angiotensin system and endothelial dysfunction  A similar mechanism seems to potentially account for SARS-CoV-2 infection  This review highlights the potentially common characteristics of pregnant women with eoPE with those with COVID-19  A better understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its impact on the placenta function is determinant since eoPE COVID-19 association may result in maternal metabolic alterations that might lead to a potential worsening of the foetal programming of diseases in the neonate  young  and adult,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920081
2399,There is an ongoing need for scientific analysis to help governments and public health authorities make decisions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic  This article presents a methodology based on data mining that can offer support for coping with epidemic diseases  The methodological approach was applied in Sao Paulo  Rio de Janeiro and Manaus  the cities in Brazil with the most COVID-19 deaths until the first half of 2021  We aimed to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in metropolises and identify air quality and meteorological variables correlated with confirmed cases and deaths  The statistical analyses indicated the most important explanatory environmental variables  while the cluster analyses showed the potential best input variables for the forecasting models  The forecast models were built by two different algorithms and their results have been compared  The relationship between epidemiological and environmental variables was particular to each of the three cities studied  Low solar radiation periods predicted in Manaus can guide managers to likely increase deaths due to COVID-19  In Sao Paulo  an increase in the mortality rate can be indicated by drought periods  The developed models can predict new cases and deaths by COVID-19 in studied cities  Furthermore  the methodological approach can be applied in other cities and for other epidemic diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966184
9674,BACKGROUND  Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of developing secondary bacterial infections  These are both difficult to diagnose and are associated with an increased mortality  Metabolomics may aid clinicians in diagnosing secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 through identification and quantification of disease specific biomarkers  with the aim of identifying underlying causative microorganisms and directing antimicrobial therapy  METHODS  This is a multi-centre prospective diagnostic observational study  Patients with COVID-19 will be recruited from critical care units in three Scottish hospitals  Three serial blood samples will be taken from patients  and an additional sample taken if a patient shows clinical or microbiological evidence of secondary infection  Samples will be analysed using LC-MS and subjected to bioinformatic processing and statistical analysis to explore the metabolite changes associated with bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients  Comparisons of the data sets will be made with standard microbiological and biochemical methods of diagnosing infection  DISCUSSION  Metabolomics analyses may provide additional strategies for identifying secondary infections  which might permit faster initiation of specific tailored antimicrobial therapy to critically ill patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856937
9291,France is one of the most vaccine-hesitant countries in the world  including for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   After 10 months of restrictive measures and media coverage of the dangers of COVID-19  French attitudes towards a vaccine continue to deteriorate  The communication strategies of the government have not helped  in fact  they have made the situation worse  Empirical studies on the national strategy for management of the COVID-19 pandemic in France have shed light on the reasons for vaccine hesitancy  These studies have identified four pillars for the vaccination strategy  i  Communication regarding the importance of herd immunity  ii  making healthcare workers the focus of the vaccination campaign  iii  citizen mobilization and guaranteed consultations  and iv  access to free vaccines without delay  This paper discusses the evidence supporting this strategy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863619

543,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to tackle viral variants  expand the number of antigens and assess diverse delivery systems for vaccines against emerging viruses  In the present study  a DNA vaccine candidate was generated by combining in tandem envelope protein domain III  EDIII  of dengue virus serotypes 1-4 and a DENV-2 NS1 protein coding region  Each domain was designed as a serotype-specific consensus coding sequence derived from different genotypes based on whole genome sequencing of clinical isolates in India and complemented with data from Africa  This sequence was further optimized for protein expression  In silico structural analysis of the EDIII consensus sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic  Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses  Assaying of intracellular IFN-gamma staining  immunoglobulin IgG2 a c  IgG1 ratios and immune gene profiling suggest a strong Th1-dominant immune response  Finally  passive transfer of immune sera protected AG129 mice challenged with a virulent  non-mouse adapted DENV-2 strain  Our findings collectively suggest an alternative strategy for dengue vaccine design  offering a novel vaccine candidate with a possible broad spectrum protection and successful clinical translation either as a stand-alone or in a mix and match strategy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999210
3666,Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect cells and tissues handled during ART is crucial for risk mitigation  especially during the implantation window when either endometrial biopsies are often practiced for endometrial receptivity assessment or embryo transfer is performed  To address this question  this review analyzed current knowledge of the field and retrospectively examined the gene expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases in a cohort of ART candidates using our previous Affymetrix microarray data  Human endometrial tissue under natural and controlled ovarian stimulation cycles and preimplantation embryos were analyzed  A focus was particularly drawn on the renin-angiotensin system  which plays a prominent role in the virus infection  and we compared the gene expression levels of receptors and proteases related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the samples  High prevalence of genes related to the ACE2 pathway during both cycle phases and mainly during the mid-secretory phase for ACE2 were reported  The impact of COS protocols on endometrial gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases is minimal  suggesting no additional potential risks during stimulated ART procedure  In blastocysts  ACE2  BSG  CTSL  CTSA and FURIN were detectable in the entire cohort at high expression level  Specimens from female genital tract should be considered as potential targets for SARS-CoV-2  especially during the implantation window,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34947909
2948,PURPOSE  This report presents two cases of successful telerehabilitation delivery for patients quarantined due to COVID-19  One of the patients did not speak the therapists  language  whereas the other presented complete deafness  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We assembled a telerehabilitation system using commercial applications  including a remote-control application that minimizes the need for patient s input  The telerehabilitation comprised a combination of video calls with a physical therapist and a 20-minute exercise video  The first case was of a 72-year-old man who could only speak Cantonese  a language that none of the service providers could speak  making communication difficult  Therefore  telerehabilitation was provided using Google Translate to simultaneously translate the therapist s instructions in Japanese to Cantonese  The second case involved a 49-year-old man with neurofibromatosis and complete deafness  In this case  communication during the exercise programme was achieved using 25 cue cards that were prepared in advance and used to convey instructions  The patients  satisfaction was assessed using either of a simple three-item questionnaire  Case 1  or the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire with five additional items  Case 2   RESULTS  In both cases  the exercise programme was successfully conducted  and the patients reported being highly satisfied with the programme  CONCLUSIONS  Communication barriers can impede telerehabilitation therapy  this problem is aggravated when the recipients cannot receive on-site education for device operation and exercise performance in advance due to COVID-19 restrictions  However  the use of supplementary methodologies may contribute to solving these issues  further expanding the coverage and applicability of telerehabilitation IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWe provided telerehabilitation for two patients with communication difficulties who were quarantined due to COVID-19 Telerehabilitation was carried out using a system with a remote-control mechanism to minimise patient input and avoid problems caused by their unfamiliarity in operating the devices In addition  an online translation mechanism was used to overcome language differences  while cue cards were used for a patient with a hearing impairment Telerehabilitation was performed without any technical issues  Both patients reported being highly satisfied with the intervention This experience of providing telerehabilitation and overcoming communication difficulties may help develop a strategy to expand the coverage of telerehabilitation in the treatment of patients in isolation due to highly transmissible diseases  such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958627
7876,This study aimed to compare longitudinal change of the psychological distress of a group with psychological first aid  PFA  experience and a group without PFA experience among physicians and other healthcare professionals from before the novel coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic to during the pandemic  The baseline survey was conducted in January 2020  T1   The respondents in T1 were invited to participate in March  T2  and November 2020  T3   Psychological distress was assessed by the Kessler 6 Scale  Participants were divided into two categories  a group with and a group without PFA experience  Participants were further divided between physicians and healthcare professionals other than physicians  because physicians are more likely to experience morally injurious events  A mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted as an indicator of the group differences  In T1  398 healthcare professionals participated  The longitudinal analysis of healthcare professionals other than physicians showed that psychological distress was significantly greater in the group without PFA experience than in the group with PFA experience  T1 vs  T3   This study showed psychological distress among healthcare professionals other than physicians was significantly greater in the group without PFA experience than in the group with PFA experience during the COVID-19 pandemic  but the results were not consistent among physicians,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886199
1277,Background  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic brought an unprecedented shift in health care toward telepsychiatry  This worldwide phenomenon was necessary to meet community health needs while prioritizing patient and provider safety  This study explored the impact of changes in delivery of mental health care services during the pandemic on patient and provider satisfaction with care  Methods  Providers and patients at an academic outpatient psychiatric clinic completed an electronic  cross-sectional  anonymous survey  Items probed perceived convenience and comfort with in-person and telehealth visits  COVID-19-related depression and anxiety  and visit modality preferences  Results  The response rate was 80 0  for providers and 21 0  for patients  Providers found telehealth more convenient than in-person visits during the pandemic  t 11  1 66  P 0 024  Patients reported no differences in convenience  P 0 497  or comfort  P 0 535  ratings  As the pandemic continues  83 3  of providers and 50 0  of patients indicated they would prefer telehealth visits  Only 16 7  of providers and 25 0  of patients would prefer telehealth visits continue after the pandemic  Preferred appointment type during the pandemic was not significantly correlated with pandemic-related anxiety or depression  Conclusion  Providers showed a strong preference for telehealth visits during the pandemic  whereas patients felt equal convenience and comfort with care in both telehealth and in-person visits  Fewer participants preferred to use the telehealth modality after the pandemic ends  Higher COVID-19-related depression or anxiety did not impact preference toward visit type  These results suggest that telepsychiatry is an acceptable  although not always preferred  modality for psychiatric care during the global pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984046

8720,INTRODUCTION  Since 2012  eighteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis  Past research suggests this policy change is associated with increased cannabis exposures however this has not yet been studied in California  despite its status as the world s largest legal cannabis market  METHODS  This observational  retrospective study analyzed trends in cannabis exposures reported to the California Poison Control System  CPCS  from 2010 to 2020  We assessed shifts in exposures before and after the legalization of recreational cannabis in November 2016  the establishment of recreational retail sales in January 2018  and the institution of a statewide shelter-in-place order due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 using interrupted time-series analysis and reviewed all records to identify specific products associated with exposures  RESULTS  Between 2010 and 2020 edible exposures increased from near zero to 79  of exposures in 2020  Cannabis exposures significantly increased following recreational legalization in 2016  by an estimated 2 07 exposures per month  CI  0 60  3 55   p < 0 01  and initiation of retail sales in 2018  0 85  CI  0 12  1 58   p < 0 05   There was no significant change in cannabis exposures following the first shelter-in-place order of the COVID-19 pandemic  1 59  CI  -1 61  3 68   p   0 43   Cannabis exposures for those thirteen and under increased significantly both after recreational legalization  1 04  CI  0 38  1 70   and after the opening of the retail sales market  0 73  CI  0 34  1 12    but not following the shelter-in-place order  1 59  CI  -1 61  3 68    nor was there a significant change for those older than thirteen  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings suggest that cannabis legalization is linked to increased exposures  particularly for products such as gummies and candy edibles among children under the age of thirteen  Clinicians should be aware of these risks and communicate them to patients  and policymakers should consider stronger regulations on packaging to reduce these exposures Key pointsQuestion  How have cannabis exposures changed following legalization of recreational use  the opening of the recreational retail sales market  and the institution of shelter-in-place orders during the COVID-19 pandemic Findings  In this retrospective review of 10 757 cases reported to the California Poison Control System  CPCS  between 2010 and 2020  exposures increased significantly after the legalization of recreational cannabis use and the opening of the recreational retail sales market  particularly among children  who primarily consumed candies and gummies Meaning  Stronger regulation of cannabis edibles that mimic other products is warranted to decrease exposures among children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871128
668,BACKGROUND  Several studies indicate that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted within indoor spaces  Therefore  environmental characterization of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with respect to human activity  building parameters  and environmental mitigation strategies is critical to combat disease transmission  METHODS  We recruited 11 participants diagnosed with COVID-19 to individually occupy a controlled chamber and conduct specified physical activities under a range of environmental conditions  we collected human and environmental samples over a period of three days for each participant  RESULTS  Here we show that increased viral load  measured by lower RNA cycle threshold  CT  values  in nasal samples is associated with higher viral loads in environmental aerosols and on surfaces captured in both the near field  1 2 m  and far field  3 5 m   We also found that aerosol viral load in far field is correlated with the number of particles within the range of 1 microm -2 5 microm  Furthermore  we found that increased ventilation and filtration significantly reduced aerosol and surface viral loads  while higher relative humidity resulted in lower aerosol and higher surface viral load  consistent with an increased rate of particle deposition at higher relative humidity  Data from near field aerosol trials with high expiratory activities suggest that respiratory particles of smaller sizes  0 3 microm -1 microm  best characterize the variance of near field aerosol viral load  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings indicate that building operation practices such as ventilation  filtration  and humidification substantially reduce the environmental aerosol viral load  and therefore inhalation dose  and should be prioritized to improve building health and safety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996097
73,The emergence of COVID-19 has brought the entire planet to a halt  Many countries  including India  were compelled to shut down most urban  industrial  social and other activities as a result of the pandemic  Due to a series of complete lockdowns imposed in India from March 24 to May 17  2020  and state-wise local level restrictions afterward  have resulted in significant reduction of emissions of numerous atmospheric pollutants  The objective of this study is to analyse the change in concentration of various pollutants such as nitrogen oxide  NO2   carbon monoxide  CO  and aerosol optical depth  AOD  due to lockdown and also to quantify the contribution of crop stubble burning to air pollution  The Sentinel-5P based NO2 and CO observations for 2019 and 2020 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer  MODIS -based AOD observations for 2016-2020 were used for detecting the variations  The obtained results showed a significant decrease in NO2 levels during various stages of lockdown  Small decrease in CO levels was observed across most part of the India  With a few exceptions  such as coastal and desert regions  there was a moderate decrease in AOD levels  Furthermore  to study the contribution of NO2  CO and AOD from crop stubble burning  MODIS observations on active fire events were obtained from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite  VIIRS   The burning of crop stubble increased NO2 emissions by 22 to 80   CO levels  on the other hand  have risen by 7 to 25   A considerable variation in AOD was reported  ranging from 1 to 426,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006403
1957,During the COVID-19 pandemic  high consumption of antivirals  antibiotics  antiparasitics  antiprotozoals  and glucocorticoids used in the treatment of this virus has been reported  Conventional treatment systems fail to efficiently remove these contaminants from water  becoming an emerging concern from the environmental field  Therefore  the objective of the present work is to address the current state of the literature on the presence and removal processes of these drugs from water bodies  It was found that the concentration of most of the drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 increased during the pandemic in water bodies  Before the pandemic  Azithromycin concentrations in surface waters were reported to be in the order of 4 3 ng L -1   and during the pandemic  they increased up to 935 ng L -1   Laboratory scale studies conclude that adsorption and advanced oxidation processes  AOPs  can be effective in the removal of these drugs  Up to more than 80  removal of Azithromycin  Chloroquine  Ivermectin  and Dexamethasone in aqueous solutions have been reported using these processes  Pilot-scale tests achieved 100  removal of Azithromycin from hospital wastewater by adsorption with powdered activated carbon  At full scale  treatment plants supplemented with ozonation and artificial wetlands removed all Favipiravir and Azithromycin  respectively  It should be noted that hybrid technologies can improve removal rates  process kinetics  and treatment cost  Consequently  the development of new materials that can act synergistically in technically and economically sustainable treatments is required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974020
1745,Repeated testing of a population is critical for limiting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and for the safe reopening of educational institutions such as kindergarten-grade 12  K-12  schools and colleges  Many screening efforts utilize the CDC RT-PCR based assay which targets two regions of the novel Coronavirus nucleocapsid gene  The standard approach of testing each person individually  however  poses a financial burden to these institutions and is therefore a barrier to using testing for re-opening  Pooling samples from multiple individuals into a single test is an attractive alternate approach that promises significant cost savings-however the specificity and sensitivity of such approaches needs to be assessed prior to deployment  To this end  we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing samples in pools of eight by the established RT-PCR assay  Participants  1 576  were recruited from amongst the Tufts University community undergoing regular screening  Each volunteer provided two swabs  one analyzed separately and the other in a pool of eight  Because the positivity rate was very low  we spiked approximately half of the pools with laboratory-generated swabs produced from known positive cases outside the Tufts testing program  The results of pooled tests had 100  correspondence with those of their respective individual tests  We conclude that pooling eight samples does not negatively impact the specificity or sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay and suggest that this approach can be utilized by institutions seeking to reduce surveillance costs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976934
5716,BACKGROUND  The epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 B 1 1 7  or Alpha  variant is insufficiently understood  This study s objective was to describe the introduction and expansion of this variant in Qatar and to estimate the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection with this variant  METHODS AND FINDINGS  Reinfections with the B 1 1 7 variant and variants of unknown status were investigated in a national cohort of 158 608 individuals with prior PCR-confirmed infections and a national cohort of 42 848 antibody-positive individuals  Infections with B 1 1 7 and variants of unknown status were also investigated in a national comparator cohort of 132 701 antibody-negative individuals  B 1 1 7 was first identified in Qatar on 25 December 2020  Sudden  large B 1 1 7 epidemic expansion was observed starting on 18 January 2021  triggering the onset of epidemic s second wave  7 months after the first wave  B 1 1 7 was about 60  more infectious than the original  wild-type  circulating variants  Among persons with a prior PCR-confirmed infection  the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated to be 97 5   95  CI  95 7  to 98 6   for B 1 1 7 and 92 2   95  CI  90 6  to 93 5   for variants of unknown status  Among antibody-positive persons  the efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated to be 97 0   95  CI  92 5  to 98 7   for B 1 1 7 and 94 2   95  CI  91 8  to 96 0   for variants of unknown status  A main limitation of this study is assessment of reinfections based on documented PCR-confirmed reinfections  but other reinfections could have occurred and gone undocumented  CONCLUSIONS  In this study  we observed that introduction of B 1 1 7 into a naive population can create a major epidemic wave  but natural immunity in those previously infected was strongly associated with limited incidence of reinfection by B 1 1 7 or other variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914711
5171,OBJECTIVE  Although there is widespread speculation about guns helping people to sleep better  this idea has only recently faced empirical scrutiny  We test whether people who own guns tend to exhibit healthier sleep outcomes than people who do not own guns and whether the association between community stress and sleep is less pronounced for people who own guns  DESIGN  We use ordinary least squares  multinomial logistic  and binary logistic regression to model cross-sectional survey data  SETTING  Our data span the United States  PARTICIPANTS  The 2021 Crime  Health  and Politics Survey  CHAPS  is based on a national probability sample of 1714 adults  MEASUREMENTS  Our analyses include multiple measures of gun ownership  personal ownership  keeping a gun in one s bedroom  and COVID-19 pandemic gun purchases   community stress  neighborhood disorder  neighborhood danger during the pandemic  and perceptions of police protection   and sleep  insomnia symptoms  sleep duration  and pandemic sleep   RESULTS  We found that people who own guns and people who do not own guns tend to exhibit similar sleep outcomes and that people who experience community stressors tend to exhibit similar sleep outcomes regardless of gun ownership  CONCLUSION  Our analyses confirm that gun ownership is unrelated to sleep and that guns are insufficient to mitigate the detrimental effects of community stress on sleep  We extend prior work by  a  using more detailed measurements of gun ownership  community stress  and sleep   b  assessing whether people keep a gun in their bedroom  and  c  exploring the intersection of pandemic gun purchases and pandemic sleep quality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924344

4112,COVID-19  SARS COV2 n-corona virus  is the newfangled virus of the coronavirus family  COVID-19 can cause serious illness with symptoms of fever  cold  cough  and respiratory blockage  COVID-19 is a contagious virus  which originated in Wuhan  China  After one month  WHO declared it as a Pandemic due to its rapid spreading  Presently  Indonesia is also facing a hard time controlling the spread  Hence  it is essential to understand the spread rate in Indonesia and to analyze the strategies to minimize the virus spread  The proposed study can be used to assess variations in virus spread both nationally  and sub-nationally  This allows public health officials and policy-makers to track the progress of the outbreak in near real-time using an epidemiologically valid measure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939041
229,Background  The dynamics of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  transmission and severity of disease among children and young people  CYP  across different settings are of considerable clinical  public health and societal interest  Severe COVID-19 cases  requiring hospitalisations  and deaths have been reported in some CYP suggesting a need to extend vaccinations to these age groups  As part of the ongoing Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19  EAVE II  study  we aim to investigate the uptake  effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in children and young people  CYP  aged 0 to 17 years in Scotland  Specifically  we will estimate   i  uptake of vaccines against COVID-19   ii  vaccine effectiveness  VE  against the outcomes of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection  hospitalisation  intensive care unit  ICU  admissions  and death   iii  VE for first second dose timing among different age groups and risk groups  and  iv  the safety of vaccines  Methods and analysis  We will conduct an open prospective cohort study classifying exposure as time-varying  We will compare outcomes amongst first dose vaccinated and second dose vaccinated CYP to those not yet vaccinated  A Test Negative Design  TND  case control study will be nested within this national cohort to investigate VE against symptomatic infection  The primary outcomes will be  i  uptake of vaccines against COVID-19   ii  time to COVID-19 infection  hospitalisation  ICU admissions or death  and  iii  adverse events related to vaccines  Vaccination status  unvaccinated  one dose and two doses  will be defined as a time-varying exposure  Data from multiple sources will be linked using a unique identifier  We will conduct descriptive analyses to explore trends in vaccine uptake  and association between different exposure variables and vaccine uptake will be determined using multivariable logistic regression models  VE will be assessed from time-dependent Cox models or Poisson regression models  adjusted for relevant confounders  including age  sex  socioeconomic status  and comorbidities  We will employ self-controlled study designs to determine the risk of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination  Ethics and dissemination  Ethics approval was obtained from the National Research Ethics Committee  South East Scotland 02  We will present findings of this study at international conferences  in peer-reviewed journals and to policy-makers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003715
8353,COVID-19 has been a global challenge ever since its emergence  with reports suggesting negative effects on the mental health and well-being of people  We investigated the associations of the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic  illness  well-being  and fear of COVID-19 in Japan  Totally  565 Japanese individuals completed an online survey  including questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes  and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale  Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scale  and present  past  and future life satisfaction scale  Analysis using structural equation models revealed that refraining from going out was a predictor of illness due to the fear of COVID-19  Decreased income predicted increased illness  but was not due to fear of COVID-19  These results suggested that the interaction between decreased time outside and increased fear of COVID-19 could affect illness  Our study suggests the role of fear of COVID-19 during pandemic and the socioeconomic impacts on mental health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876889
642,OBJECTIVES  The rapid influx of patients with COVID-19 to intensive care at a rate that exceeds pre-existing staff capacity has required the rapid development of innovative redeployment and training strategies  which considered patient care and infection control  The aim of this study was to provide a detailed understanding of redeployment and training during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic by capturing and considering the merit of the strategies enlisted and the experiences and needs of redeployed healthcare workers  HCWs   DESIGN  The review involved a systematic search of key terms related to intensive care AND training AND redeployment AND healthcare workers within nine databases  Medline  CINAHL  PsychINFO  MedRxiv  Web of Science  The Health Management Consortium database  Social Science Research Network  OpenGrey and TRIP   which took place on 16 July 2021  Analysis consisted of a synthesis of quantitative study outputs and framework-based thematic analysis of qualitative study outputs and grey literature  These results were then combined applying an interpretative synthesis  We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses  and the review protocol was available online  RESULTS  Forty papers were analysed  These took place primarily in the UK  n 15  37 5   and USA  n 17  42 5    Themes presented in the results are redeployment  implementation strategies and learning  redeployed HCWs  experience and strategies to address their needs  redeployed HCWs  learning needs  training formats offered and training evaluations  and future redeployment and training delivery  Based on this  key principles for successful redeployment and training were proposed  CONCLUSIONS  The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to develop flexible redeployment strategies and deliver training promptly while following infection control recommendations  This review synthesises original approaches to tackle these challenges  which are relevant to inform the development of targeted and adaptative training and redeployment plans considering the needs of HCWs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996785
1901,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora  CITES  prohibits commercial trans-national trade in pangolin specimens  However  African pangolins are continually trafficked to Asia for traditional medicine  with Nigeria considered a key hub  Using reported Nigeria-linked pangolin seizure data and interviews with Nigerian law enforcement officials  we a  characterised Nigeria s involvement in global pangolin trafficking January 2010-September 2021  particularly observing trafficking trends after pangolin s CITES Appendix I listing  b  estimated the minimum number of pangolins whose scales are in Nigeria-linked seizures January 2010-September 2021  and  c  assessed ongoing efforts within Nigeria to curb pangolin trafficking  Nigeria-linked seizures involved 190 407 kg of pangolin derivatives  99 9  scales  from a minimum of 799 343 pangolins  95  confidence interval  625 944-996 353  of four species  see caveats in Methods   All shipments confiscated in transit were destined for Asia  with a rapid increase in the mass of maritime shipments over time  Furthermore  stockpiling of pangolin derivatives for overseas shipment is perhaps a prominent trafficking model in Nigeria  Nigeria s law enforcement efforts improved from 2017  the same year Nigeria apparently began playing a hub role  The impact of pangolin s CITES Appendix I listing on pangolin trafficking was unclear  as the marked rise in seizures from 2017 when the listing became effective  coincided with improvements in Nigerian law enforcement efforts  COVID-19-induced travel restrictions likely reduced trafficking activities in 2020 but activities may have fully resumed in 2021  This study provides new information to inform effective enforcement and policy formulation efforts to protect African pangolins,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975159
7212,Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting mental health  especially for sexual and gender minority populations  Relatively little is known about the impact of the pandemic on disordered eating behaviors  DEB  for these populations  The aim of this study is to understand changes in DEB across COVID-19 within an LGBTQ  sample  with a particular focus on differences across sexual and gender identities  and the impact of social support on these outcomes  In a sample of 830 LGBTQ  adults with a past year history of DEB  most  but not all  participants reported that the frequency of and urge to engage in each DEB increased a little bit or a lot during COVID-19  Contrary to research showing more severe psychopathology and DEB among gender minorities  GM  compared to sexual minorities  SM   changes in DEB severity since COVID-19 were not significantly different between SM and GM participants  There were a few small and significant relationships between changes in average DEB severity and characteristics of interpersonal relationships  average quality of home relationships  and living with someone not affirming of one s identity  Results highlight that COVID-19 may have exacerbated DEB for SGM young adults  that these changes were not different across sexual versus gender minorities  and that these changes are weakly but significantly related to minority stressors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896869
1533,There have been many reports on the effectiveness of various disinfection methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   and their applicability to the disinfection of N95 respirators and surgical masks  To date  there have been no reports on the decontamination of the intermediate layers  In this study  the conditions required for the decontamination of such layers were set by simulation considering the thickness and shape of the N95 respirators or surgical masks  samples   After applying heat  steam  dry heat  or hot water  at 75 degrees C for 60 min or chemical  benzalkonium chloride or laundry detergent  treatment  the collection efficiency of the samples was checked and evaluated  After the dry heat treatment  the time between treatment and when the heat reached the intermediate layer of the filter fiber was extended by 10 min  A dry heat disinfection method that combines hot water and a closed container was also evaluated  and satisfactory conditions were extended by 60 min  For each heat treatment  there was almost no effect on the collection efficiency  although there were cases where deformation was caused by mechanical stress  In contrast  chemical treatment resulted in a reduction in the collection efficiency of smaller particles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980707
7476,The Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology  at University of Missouri  has researched the use of smart  unobtrusive sensors for older adult residents  health monitoring and alerting in aging-in-place communities for many years  Sensors placed in the apartments of older adult residents generate a deluge of daily data that is automatically aggregated  analyzed  and summarized to aid in health awareness  clinical care  and research for healthy aging  When anomalies or concerning trends are detected within the data  the sensor information is converted into linguistic health messages using fuzzy computational techniques  so as to make it understandable to the clinicians  Sensor data are analyzed at the individual level  therefore  through this study we aim to discover various combinations of patterns of anomalies happening together and recurrently in the older adult s population using these text summaries  Leveraging various computational text data processing techniques  we are able to extract relevant analytical features from the health messages  These features are transformed into a transactional encoding  then processed with frequent pattern mining techniques for association rule discovery  At individual level analysis  resident ID 3027 was considered as an exemplar to describe the analysis  Seven combinations of anomalies rules associations were discovered in this resident  out of which rule group three showed an increased recurrence during the COVID lockdown of facility  At the population level  a total of 38 associations were discovered that highlight the health patterns  and we continue to explore the health conditions associated with them  Ultimately  our goal is to correlate the combinations of anomalies with certain health conditions  which can then be leveraged for predictive analytics and preventative care  This will improve the current clinical care systems for older adult residents in smart sensor  aging-in-place communities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891720
9553,Background  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has resulted in  4 8 million deaths worldwide as of this writing  Almost all conceivable aspects of SARS-CoV-2 have been explored since the virus began spreading in the human population  Despite numerous proposals  it is still unclear how and when the virus gained the ability to efficiently bind to and infect human cells  In an effort to understand the evolution of receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2  and specifically  how the ability of RBD to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor  ACE2  of humans evolved in coronaviruses  we have applied an alignment-free technique to infer functional relatedness among betacoronaviruses  This technique  concurrently being optimized for identifying novel prions  was adapted to gain new insights into coronavirus evolution  specifically in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  Novel methods for predicting the capacity for coronaviruses  in general  to infect human cells are urgently needed  Methodology  proposed method utilizes physicochemical properties of amino acids to develop fully dynamic waveform representations of proteins that encode both the amino acid content and the context of amino acids  These waveforms are then subjected to dynamic time warping  DTW  and distance evaluation to develop a distance metric that is relatively less sensitive to variation in sequence length and primary amino acid composition  Results and Conclusions  Using our proposed method  we show that in contrast to alignment-based maximum likelihood  ML  and neighbor-joining  NJ  phylogenetic analyses  all bat betacoronavirus spike protein RBDs known to bind to the ACE2 receptor are found within a single physicochemical cluster  Further  other RBDs within that cluster are from pangolin coronaviruses  two of which have already been shown to bind to ACE2 while the others are suspected  yet unverified ACE2 binding domains  This finding is important because both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARS-CoV  and SARS-CoV-2 use the host ACE2 receptor for cell entry  Surveillance for coronaviruses belonging to this cluster could potentially guide efforts to stifle or curtail potential and or early zoonotic outbreaks with their associated deaths and financial devastation  Lay Summary  Robust methods for predicting human ACE2 receptor binding by the spike protein of coronaviruses are needed for the early detection of zoonotic coronaviruses and biosurveillance to prevent future outbreaks  Here we present a new waveform-based approach that utilizes the physicochemical properties of amino acids to determine the propensity of betacoronaviruses to infect humans  Comparison with the established phylogenetic methods demonstrates the usefulness of this new approach in the biosurveillance of coronaviruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858595
6912,Response to vaccines generally varies according to individual factors of the vaccinated subjects such as demographics and immune status  While there are various reports of factors associated with immunogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines  little is known about those of adenovirus vector vaccines  We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the relationships of antibody level with age  sex  body mass index  BMI   and adverse reactions  ARs  to an adenovirus vector vaccine  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  Healthcare workers who planned to receive both the first and second injections of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine at Hanyang University Hospital  Seoul  Korea  were enrolled in the study  Seven days after each injection  participants were asked to complete an online adverse reaction survey  In addition  anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein receptor binding domain  RBD  antibody concentration was measured 4 weeks after the second injection  All participants  n   447  100   showed serologic positivity  >   0 8 U mL  4 weeks after the second injection of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  Furthermore  the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD concentration was similar among groups when stratified by age  sex  BMI  or presence and severity of AR  multivariable linear regression found no associations between antibody response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and age  BMI  sex  and vaccine-induced ARs  In conclusion  age  sex  obesity  and ARs were not associated with antibody responses after two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899739

319,Background  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has been shown to affect several systems  notably the respiratory system  However  there has been considerable evidence implicating the nervous system in COVID-19 infection  This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients whose cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  tested positive for SARS-CoV-2  Methods  A comprehensive search of PubMed  EMBASE  Scopus  WHO Coronavirus database  bioRxiv  medRxiv  and Web of Science databases was carried out in August 2020  Original studies involving patients who tested positive for SARS-COV-2 in their CSF were included  Key search terms encompassed all variations of  COVID-19  AND  Cerebrospinal Fluid   Results  A total of 525 studies were identified  Fifty-six full-text articles were assessed  of which 14 were included  In total  14 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their CSF  21 4   3 14  of patients had negative nasopharyngeal  NP  swabs despite a positive CSF sample  About 14 2   2 14  of patients who initially had positive NP swabs developed neurological deterioration after a supposed recovery as indicated by their negative NP swabs  but their CSF still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2  Common symptoms were headache  42 8   6 14   fever  35 6   5 14   vomiting  28 6   4 14   cough  28 6  4 14   visual disturbances  28 6   4 14   diarrhea  21 4   3 14   and seizures  21 4   3 14   Four patients  28 6   were admitted to ICU  one  7 14   was admitted to a rehabilitation facility  and two  14 3   died  Conclusion  Physicians should be familiar with the presenting neurological features of COVID-19  and be aware that they can occur despite a negative NP swab  The results of this study are intended to aid in the development of informed guidelines to diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002295
5381,BACKGROUND  Selection  outcome and publication biases are well described in case reports and case series but may be less of a problem early in the appearance of a new disease when all cases might appear to be worth publishing  OBJECTIVE  To use a prospectively collected database of primary sources to compare the reporting of COVID-19 in pregnancy in case reports  case series and in registries over the first 8 months of the pandemic  STUDY DESIGN  MEDLINE  Embase and Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched from 22 March to 5 November 2020  to create a curated list of primary sources  Duplicate reports were excluded  Case reports  case series and registry studies of pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19  where neonatal outcomes were reported  were selected and data extracted on neonatal infection status  neonatal death  neonatal intensive care unit admission  preterm birth  stillbirth  maternal critical care unit admission and maternal death  RESULTS  149 studies comprising 41 658 mothers and 8 854 neonates were included  All complications were more common in case reports  and in retrospective series compared with presumably prospective registry studies  Extensive overlap is likely in registry studies  with cases from seven countries reported by multiple registries  The UK Obstetric Surveillance System was the only registry to explicitly report identification and removal of duplicate cases  although five other registries reported collection of patient identifiable data which would facilitate identification of duplicates  CONCLUSIONS  Since it is likely that registries provide the least biased estimates  the higher rates seen in the other two study designs are probably due to selection or publication bias  However even some registry studies include self- or doctor-reported cases  so might be biased  and we could not completely exclude overlap of cases in some registries,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920270

834,Background  It has been suggested that resilience is best conceptualized as healthy and stable functioning in the face of a potentially traumatic event  However  most research on this field has focused on self-reported resilience  and other patterns of response when facing adversity  in cross-sectional designs  Objective  Alternatively  we aimed to study changing patterns of psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population  based on patterns of symptoms  and factors contributing to those patterns  Method  A national representative sample of Spain  N   1 628  responded to an internet-based survey at two assessment points  separated by 1 month  April and May 2020   during the official national confinement stage  Based upon whether participants exhibited absence presence of distress  i e   significant trauma-related  depression  or anxiety symptoms  at one or two of the assessment times  patterns of psychological responses were defined by categorizing individuals into one of the four categories  Resilience  Delayed distress  Recovered  and Sustained distress  Results  Analyses of the levels of disturbance associated with the symptoms provided support to that four-fold distinction of patterns of responses  Furthermore  resilience responses were the most common psychological response to the pandemic  Multinomial regression analyses revealed that the main variables increasing the probability of resilience to COVID-19 were being male  older  having no history of mental health difficulties  higher levels of psychological well-being and high identification with all humanity  Also  having low scores in several variables  i e   anxiety and economic threat due to COVID-19  substance use during the confinement  intolerance to uncertainty  death anxiety  loneliness  and suspiciousness  was a significant predictor of a resilient response to COVID-19  Conclusion  Our findings are consistent with previous literature that conceptualizes resilience as a dynamic process  The clinical implications of significant predictors of the resilience and the rest of psychological patterns of response are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992748
2276,Hadamard encoded saturation transfer can significantly improve the efficiency of NOE-based NMR correlations from labile protons in proteins  glycans and RNAs  increasing the sensitivity of cross-peaks by an order of magnitude and shortening experimental times by >  100-fold  These schemes  however  fail when tackling correlations within a pool of labile protons -for instance imino-imino correlations in RNAs or amide-amide correlations in proteins  Here we analyze the origin of the artifacts appearing in these experiments  and propose a way to obtain artifact-free correlations both within the labile pool as well as between labile and non-labile 1 Hs  while still enjoying the gains arising from Hadamard encoding and solvent repolarizations  The principles required for implementing what we define as the extended Hadamard scheme are derived  and its clean  artifact-free  sensitivity-enhancing performance is demonstrated on RNA fragments derived from the SARS-CoV-2 genome  Sensitivity gains per unit time approaching an order of magnitude are then achieved in both imino-imino and imino-amino aromatic protons 2D correlations  similar artifact-free sensitivity gains can be observed when carrying out extended Hadamard encodings of 3D NOESY HSQC-type experiments  The resulting spectra reveal significantly more correlations than their conventionally acquired counterparts  which can support the spectral assignment and secondary structure determination of structured RNA elements,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968005

7006,The requirements of  social distancing  during the Corona pandemic raised challenges for the implementation of psychosocial care services for children  adolescents  and families  which are traditionally reliant on face-to-face contact  Between March and October 2020  this qualitative study investigated the impact of the pandemic on the provision of psychosocial care at three points in time  We examined how staff and managers of psychosocial institutions experienced their work under the changing circumstances and what opportunities as well as risks they perceived for their work with clients  Their work situation is investigated by means of the concepts of the  Arbeitskraftunternehmer  and of vulnerability  This paper presents two topics that emerged from the analysis of the first two waves of data collection  The first expresses a conflict between practitioners need to protect their own health and their aspiration to maintain services  The second addresses practitioners  experiences of stress due to their own affectedness by the crisis as well as significant changes in work realities  Our data show the strong effort of professionals to maintain supportive services during the crisis despite difficult conditions  However  it also shows the strain on social workers in the field and that adequate framework conditions are necessary both to strengthen psychosocial care in general and to cope with social crises on this scale,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898958
4534,At present  the most powerful new drugs for COVID-19 are antibody proteins  In addition  there are some star small molecule drugs  However  there are few studies on nanomaterials  Here  we study the intact graphene  IG   defective graphene  DG   and graphene oxide  GO  interacting with COVID-19 protein  We find that they show progressive inhibition of COVID-19 protein  By using molecular dynamics simulations  we study the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 3CL M pro  and graphene-related materials  GRMs   IG  DG  and GO  The results show that M pro  can be absorbed onto the surfaces of investigated materials  DG and GO interacted with M pro  more intensely  causing the decisive part of M pro  to become more flexible  Further analysis shows that compared to IG and GO  DG can inactivate M pro  and inhibit its expression effectively by destroying the active pocket of M pro   Our work not only provides detailed and reliable theoretical guidance for the application of GRMs in treating with SARS-CoV-2 but also helps in developing new graphene-based anti-COVID-19 materials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933561
1203,Coronavirus infections induce the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines  We have previously shown that in cells infected with gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus  IBV   interleukin 6  IL-6  and IL-8 were drastically upregulated  and the MAP kinase p38 and the integrated stress response pathways were implicated in this process  In this study  we report that coronavirus infection activates a negative regulatory loop that restricts the upregulation of a number of proinflammatory genes  As revealed by the initial transcriptomic and subsequent validation analyses  the anti-inflammatory adenine-uridine  AU -rich element  ARE -binding protein  Zinc finger protein 36  ZFP36  and its related family members were upregulated in cells infected with IBV and three other coronaviruses  alphacoronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  PEDV  and human coronavirus 229E  HCoV-229E   and betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43  respectively  Characterization of the functional roles of ZFP36 during IBV infection demonstrated that ZFP36 promoted the degradation of transcripts coding for IL-6  IL-8  dual-specificity phosphatase 1  DUSP1   prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2  PTGS2  and TNF-alpha-induced protein 3  TNFAIP3   through binding to AREs in these transcripts  Consistently  knockdown and inhibition of JNK and p38 kinase activities reduced the expression of ZFP36  as well as the expression of IL-6 and IL-8  On the contrary  overexpression of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3  MKK3  and MAPKAP kinase-2  MK2   the upstream and downstream kinases of p38  respectively  increased the expression of ZFP36 and decreased the expression of IL-8  Taken together  this study reveals an important regulatory role of the MKK3-p38-MK2-ZFP36 axis in coronavirus infection-induced proinflammatory response  Importance Excessive and uncontrolled induction and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines  the so-called cytokine release syndrome  CRS   would cause life-threatening complications and multiple organ failure in severe coronavirus infections  including severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS   Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  and COVID-19  This study reveals that coronavirus infection also induces the expression of ZFP36  an anti-inflammatory ARE-binding protein  promoting the degradation of ARE-containing transcripts coding for IL-6 and IL-8 as well as a number of other proteins related to inflammatory response  Furthermore  the p38 MAP kinase  its upstream kinase MKK3 and downstream kinase MK2 were shown to play a regulatory role in upregulation of ZFP36 during coronavirus infection cycles  This MKK3-p38-MK2-ZFP36 axis would constitute a potential therapeutic target for severe coronavirus infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985993
2921,Background  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has been responsible for over 3 4 million deaths globally and over 25 million cases in India  As part of the response  India imposed a nation-wide lockdown and prioritized COVID-19 care in hospitals and intensive care units  ICUs   Leveraging data from the Indian Registry of IntenSive care  we sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on critical care service utilization  case-mix  and clinical outcomes in non-COVID ICUs  Methods  We included all consecutive patients admitted between 1  st  October 2019 and 27  th  September 2020  Data were extracted from the registry database and included patients admitted to the non-COVID or general ICUs at each of the sites  Outcomes included measures of resource-availability  utilisation  case-mix  acuity  and demand for ICU beds  We used a Mann-Whitney test to compare the pre-pandemic period  October 2019 - February 2020  to the pandemic period  March-September 2020   In addition  we also compared the period of intense lockdown  March-May 31  st  2020  with the pre-pandemic period  Results  There were 3424 patient encounters in the pre-pandemic period and 3524 encounters in the pandemic period  Comparing these periods  weekly admissions declined  median  Q1 Q3  160  145 168  to 113  98 5 134   p<0 001   unit turnover declined  median  Q1 Q3  12 1  11 32 13  to 8 58  7 24 10   p<0 001   and APACHE II score increased  median  Q1 Q3  19  19 20  to 21  20 22    p<0 001   Unadjusted ICU mortality increased  9 3  to 11 7   p 0 015  and the length of ICU stay was similar  median  Q1 Q3  2 11  2  2  vs  2 24  2  3  days  p 0 151   Conclusion  Our registry-based analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID critical care demonstrates significant disruptions to healthcare utilization during the pandemic and an increase in the severity of illness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957335
2499,Trust is an important correlate of well-being  and it plays an important moderating role against adversity  But does this conclusion also hold during pandemics  We address this question by investigating the role of interpersonal and institutional trust for well-being  as measured by five proxies  during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia  We also examined age and gender differences in the relationship between trust and well-being  and tested the protective role of trust among individuals whose well-being might be at risk during the pandemic  The sample included a total of 5776 Serbian adults  Mage   37 00 years  75  female   The results showed that interpersonal trust has a small but significant relationship with well-being  whereas institutional trust has negligible effects  We also found some evidence for the protective role of general interpersonal trust on well-being among individuals with poorer self-rated health and in a poorer financial situation  Our findings confirm the role of interpersonal trust for well-being in times of crisis  and support previous evidence indicating that promoting interpersonal trust should be a core goal of public policy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964386
3457,A novel coronavirus  or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   was identified as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   In early 2020  the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 the sixth public health emergency of international concern  The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected many groups within the general population  but particularly those with extant clinical conditions  such as having or being treated for cancer  Cancer patients are at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 since the malignancy and chemotherapy may negatively affect the immune system  and their immunocompromised condition also increases the risk of infection  Substantial international efforts are currently underway to develop specific methods for diagnosing and treating COVID-19  However  cancer patients  risk profiles  management  and outcomes are not well understood  Thus  the main objective of this review is to discuss the relevant evidence to understand the prognosis of COVID-19 infections in cancer patients more clearly  as well as helping to improve the clinical management of these patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951152
8358,The patient had several close contacts with friends from Wuhan  the epicenter of the epidemic  His mother and father had close contact with him  His father was later diagnosed with COVID-19 infection after a positive reverse transcription PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  The patient and his mother were diagnosed as suspected cases of COVID-19 based on a history of exposure  clinical manifestation  and imaging examination  However  the patient was tested more than three times with the reverse transcription PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  and the results were negative each time  COVID-19 should be suspected  regardless of SARS-CoV-2 test negativity  for recent close contact with a confirmed case and respiratory symptoms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876822
4294,When COVID-19 cases surge  identifying ways to improve the efficiency of contact tracing and prioritize vulnerable communities for isolation and quarantine support services is critical  During a fall 2020 COVID-19 resurgence in San Francisco  California  prioritization of telephone-based case investigation by zip code and using a chatbot to screen for case participants who needed isolation support reduced the number of case participants who would have been assigned for a telephone interview by 31 5  and likely contributed to 87 5  of Latinx case participants being successfully interviewed   Am J Public Health  2022 112 1  43-47  https   doi org 10 2105 AJPH 2021 306563,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936405
3333,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted children and young people experiencing child abuse and neglect  Child Protective Services  CPS  has played an important role in supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic  Few studies to-date have evaluated the impact of the pandemic on CPS caseworkers and administrators in the United States  OBJECTIVES  We conducted interviews to explore CPS caseworkers  and administrators  experiences working and serving families during the pandemic  METHODS  Participants were U S -based CPS caseworkers and administrators  We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with participants and used an inductive thematic analysis approach  RESULTS  We conducted 37 interviews  Participants discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way they conduct investigations and provide services to families in the CPS system  Several services were adapted to occur virtually  providing challenges and unique opportunities  Participants also described the personal barriers they faced during the pandemic  including working remotely  experiencing burnout  and challenges obtaining personal protective equipment  Finally  participants shared creative solutions they engaged in to support children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic  including expanding collaborations with other community-based organizations  DISCUSSION  This study suggests the important role that CPS has played during the pandemic and challenges individual CPS workers felt  in terms of both experiencing burnout and difficulty obtaining personalized protective equipment  Inclusion of the CPS system in emergency preparedness planning for future pandemics or natural disasters will ensure continuation of these vital services,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953611
665,Translation of traditional knowledge of herbs into a viable product for clinical use is still an uphill task  Piperine  a pungent alkaloid molecule derived from Piper nigrum and Piper longum possesses diverse pharmacological effects  Traditionally  pepper is used for arthritis  bronchitis  gastritis  diarrhea  snake bite  menstrual pain  fever  and bacterial infections  etc  The anti-inflammatory  antioxidant and immunomodulatory actions of piperine are the possible mechanisms behind its therapeutic potential  Various in-silico and experimental studies have shown piperine as a possible promising molecule in coronavirus disease  COVID-19   ebola  and dengue due to its immunomodulatory and antiviral activities  The other important clinical applications of piperine are due to its bio enhancing effect on drugs  by modulating  absorption in the gastrointestinal tract  altering activities of transporters like p-glycoprotein substrates  and modulating drug metabolism by altering the expression of cytochrome P450 or UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes  Piperine attracted clinicians in treating patients with arthritis  metabolic syndrome  diabetes  skin infections  gastric and liver disorders  This review focused on systematic  evidence-based insight into the use of piperine in clinical settings and mechanistic details behind its therapeutic actions  Also  highlights a number of clinical trials of piperine at various stages exploring its clinical application in cancer  neurological  respiratory  and viral disease  etc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996326
4686,The widespread effects of COVID-19 have dramatically increased the prevalence of mental health difficulties  meaning it is vital to explore psychotherapy options  Acceptance and Commitment therapy  ACT  helps individuals engage in meaningful activities despite difficult and unchangeable circumstances  Recent literature suggests that psychological flexibility  the underlying process of ACT  may moderate COVID-related distress - making ACT a promising psychotherapy candidate  This study therefore aimed to explore the effects of an ACT-based  guided self-help intervention on wellbeing  psychological flexibility  COVID-related distress  and general psychological distress within the general population  48 participants  recruited via social media  engaged in a three-week  non-concurrent baseline phase  then received six  weekly  digital modules and weekly webinars to address module queries  20 participants completed all modules and provided post-intervention feedback via an online qualitative survey  Multilevel modelling analysis found significant improvements in  wellbeing  overall psychological flexibility  including subscales behavioural awareness and valued action   and general psychological distress  including depression  anxiety and stress   No significant changes were found for COVID-related distress  Findings were sustained at one- and two-months follow-up - suggesting lasting change  Qualitative findings provide further insights about the experience of the intervention  participants reported improved wellbeing  still experiencing COVID-related distress  but felt more able to cope with general psychological distress  such as anxiety   No change in COVID-related distress scores may be due to methodological and measurement issues  This study is one of the first to explore ACT as a psychotherapeutic intervention for COVID-related distress and adds to the growing body of literature highlighting psychological flexibility as a key process for mitigating COVID-related distress,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931160
7991,The epidemic coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has now spread worldwide and efficacious therapeutics are urgently needed  3-Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease  3CL pro   is an indispensable protein in viral replication and represents an attractive drug target for fighting COVID-19  Herein  we report the discovery of 9 10-dihydrophenanthrene derivatives as non-peptidomimetic and non-covalent inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro   The structure-activity relationships of 9 10-dihydrophenanthrenes as SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibitors have carefully been investigated and discussed in this study  Among all tested 9 10-dihydrophenanthrene derivatives  C1 and C2 display the most potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibition activity  with IC50 values of 1 55   - 0 21 muM and 1 81   - 0 17 muM  respectively  Further enzyme kinetics assays show that these two compounds dose-dependently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro via a mixed-inhibition manner  Molecular docking simulations reveal the binding modes of C1 in the dimer interface and substrate-binding pocket of the target  In addition  C1 shows outstanding metabolic stability in the gastrointestinal tract  human plasma  and human liver microsome  suggesting that this agent has the potential to be developed as an orally administrated SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibitor,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883292
6350,PURPOSE  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a systemic inflammatory condition associated with coagulopathy which may result in severe thromboembolic complications  Cardiac injury is not uncommon in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and therefore we aimed to investigate whether it stems from an abnormal coagulative state  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19  Traditional coagulation and whole blood rotational thromboelastometry tests were compared between patients with and without cardiac injury  Cardiac injury was defined by increased levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I  hs-cTnI   RESULTS  The study population consisted of 104 patients  67  males  median age 65 years   of whom 40  38   developed cardiac injury  No clinical differences in the traditional coagulation parameters were observed between patients with and without cardiac injury  Thromboelastometry analysis revealed abnormal maximum clot firmness  MCF  levels in FIBTEM assay in 80  77   patients  No significant differences in MCF values  p   0 450  and percentage of abnormal MCF  p   0 290  were detected between patients with and without cardiac injury  Cardiac injury - not hypercoagulability - was associated with mortality  p   0 016   CONCLUSIONS  No differences in traditional coagulation and rotational thromboelastometry parameters were found among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without cardiac injury  Other mechanisms besides hypercoagulability may be a main culprit for cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906908
8242,More than a year after the first domestic COVID-19 cases  the United States does not have national standards for COVID-19 surveillance data analysis and public reporting  This has led to dramatic variations in surveillance practices among public health agencies  which analyze and present newly confirmed cases by a wide variety of dates  The choice of which date to use should be guided by a balance between interpretability and epidemiological relevance  Report date is easily interpretable  generally representative of outbreak trends  and available in surveillance data sets  These features make it a preferred date for public reporting and visualization of surveillance data  although it is not appropriate for epidemiological analyses of outbreak dynamics  Symptom onset date is better suited for such analyses because of its clinical and epidemiological relevance  However  using symptom onset for public reporting of new confirmed cases can cause confusion because reporting lags result in an artificial decline in recent cases  We hope this discussion is a starting point toward a more standardized approach to date-based surveillance  Such standardization could improve public comprehension  policymaking  and outbreak response   Am J Public Health  2021 111 12  2127-2132  https   doi org 10 2105 AJPH 2021 306520,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878867
1189,The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to counteract it have highlighted the role of individual differences in evaluating and reacting to emergencies  and the challenges inherent in promoting precautionary behaviours  We aimed to explore the psychological and cognitive factors modulating behaviour and intentions during the national lockdown in Italy  We administered an online questionnaire  N   244  that included tests for assessing personality traits  Temperament and Character Inventory  Locus of Control of Behaviour  and moral judgment  Moral Foundations Questionnaire   alongside behavioural economics tasks addressing different facets of risk attitude  loss aversion  risk aversion and delay discounting   We then assessed the extent to which individual variations in these dimensions modulated participants  compliance with the lockdown norms  When assessing their joint contribution via multiple regressions  lockdown adherence was mostly predicted by internal locus of control  psycho-economic dimensions suggestive of long-sighted and loss-averse attitudes  as well as personality traits related to cautionary behaviour  such as harm avoidance  and the authority moral concern  These findings show that a multi-domain assessment of the factors underlying personal intentions  and thus driving compliance with government measures  can help predict individuals  actions during health emergencies  This evidence points to factors that should be considered when developing interventions and communication strategies to promote precautionary behaviours,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986209
3886,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic follows an unpredictable evolution  driven by both host-related factors such as mobility  vaccination status  and comorbidities and by pathogen-related ones  The pathogenicity of its causative agent  SARS-CoV-2 virus  relates to the functions of the proteins synthesized intracellularly  as guided by viral RNA  These functions are constantly altered through mutations resulting in increased virulence  infectivity  and antibody-evasion abilities  Well-characterized mutations in the spike protein  such as D614G  N439K  Delta69-70  E484K  or N501Y  are currently defining specific variants  however  some less studied mutations outside the spike region  such as p  3691 in NSP6  p  9659 in ORF-10  8782C > T in ORF-1ab  or 28144T > C in ORF-8  have been proposed for altering SARS-CoV-2 virulence and pathogenicity  Therefore  in this study  we focused on A105V mutation of SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a accessory protein  which has been associated with severe COVID-19 clinical manifestation  Molecular dynamics and computational structural analyses revealed that this mutation differentially alters ORF7a dynamics  suggesting a gain-of-function role that may explain its role in the severe form of COVID-19 disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943191
1494,The emergence of the highly-transmissible B 1 1 529 Omicron variant of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is concerning for antibody countermeasure efficacy because of the number of mutations in the spike protein  Here  we tested a panel of anti-receptor binding domain monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology  S309  the parent mAb of VIR-7831  Sotrovimab    AstraZeneca  COV2-2196 and COV2-2130  the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061   Regeneron  REGN10933 and REGN10987   Lilly  LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016   and Celltrion  CT-P59  for their ability to neutralize an infectious B 1 1 529 Omicron isolate  Several mAbs  LY-CoV555  LY-CoV016  REGN10933  REGN10987  and CT-P59  completely lost neutralizing activity against B 1 1 529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells  whereas others were reduced  COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination   12-fold decrease  or minimally affected  S309   Our results suggest that several  but not all  of the antibodies in clinical use may lose efficacy against the B 1 1 529 Omicron variant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981042
1056,Background  Cardiovascular complications of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS- CoV-2   have been documented both in the acute phase and in convalescence  One such complication is the formation of the left ventricular  LV  thrombus  There is a lack of clarity regarding the incidence  risk factors  and management of this complication  Aim  The aim of the study is to identify the clinical presentation  risk factors and outcome of COVID-19 patients with left ventricular thrombus  LVT   Methods  A literature search was conducted to identify all case reports of COVID-19 with LVT in PubMed Medline  Embase  Web of Science  and Google Scholar  Results  Among the 65 patients identified  60 had LVT  either at admission  or during the acute phase of the illness  Six patients with mild symptoms during the acute phase of viral illness had only the COVID-19 antibody test positivity at the time LV thrombus was detected  Few of the patients  23 1   had no comorbidities  The mean age of the patients was 52 8 years  and the youngest patient was 4 years old  This suggests that LVT formation can occur in young COVID-19 patients with no co-morbid conditions  Most of the patients  69 2   had more than one site of thrombosis  A mortality rate of 23 1  was observed in our review  and ST-elevation myocardial infarction  STEMI  was diagnosed in 33 3  of those who died  Conclusions  A high degree of suspicion for LVT must be maintained in patients with known cardiac disease and those with new-onset arterial or venous thromboembolism  and such patients may benefit from a screening echocardiography at admission  Relevance for Patients  The patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease must take added precautions to prevent acquiring COVID-19 infection as there is a higher risk of developing LV thrombus  In patients who develop LVT in COVID-19  mortality rate is higher,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988332
4464,Exceptional pandemic lockdown measures enabled singular experiments such as analysing the energy consumption of vacant buildings  This paper assesses the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the energy use of academic buildings  For this purpose  weather-adjusted energy use was compared before and during the lockdown  including different levels of lockdown restrictions  Results obtained for the 83 academic buildings of Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya - Barcelona Tech  UPC  reveal that the avoided energy consumption amounted to over 4 3 GWh during the post-pandemic year  However  the results indicate that academic buildings were still using approximately 46 9  of their typical energy consumption during strict lockdown  This revelation emphasizes the high environmental burden of buildings  regardless of whether they are occupied,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934266
5033,The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  in 2019 has rapidly become a global health emergency  COVID-19 develops from a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARS-CoV  infection  which directly impacts the cardiovascular system by disrupting angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors in the tissues  This leads to severe complications that cause major morbidity and mortality  Several cardiovascular complications have been reported during the pandemic  including myocardial infarction  stroke  pulmonary embolism  myocarditis  and tachyarrhythmias  Although bradyarrhythmia is another cardiac event associated with COVID-19  it has been reported in only a few cases in the medical literature  Here  we report two cases of young adult patients who were admitted because of a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test of SARS-CoV-2 and presented with bradycardia detected on electrocardiogram but had an otherwise normal health condition with no history of cardiovascular illness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925977
9689,We have applied our advanced multicanonical molecular dynamics  McMD -based dynamic docking methodology to investigate the binding mechanism of an HIV-1 Nef protein epitope to the Asian-dominant allele human leukocyte antigen  HLA -A 2402  Even though pMHC complex formation  between a Major histocompatibility complex  MHC  class I molecule  which is encoded by an HLA allele  and an antigen peptide  is one of the fundamental processes of the adaptive human immune response  its binding mechanism has not yet been well studied  partially due to the high allelic variation of HLAs in the population  We have used our developed McMD-based dynamic docking method and have successfully reproduced the native complex structure  which is located near the free energy global minimum  Subsequent path sampling MD simulations elucidated the atomic details of the binding process and indicated that the peptide binding is initially driven by the highly positively charged N-terminus of the peptide that is attracted to the various negatively charged residues on the MHC molecule s surface  Upon nearing the pocket  the second tyrosine residue of the peptide anchors the peptide by strongly binding to the B-site of the MHC molecule via hydrophobic driven interactions  resulting in a very strong bound complex structure  Our methodology can be effectively used to predict the bound complex structures between MHC molecules and their antigens to study their binding mechanism in close detail  which would help with the development of new vaccines against cancers  as well as viral infections such as HIV and COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856806
1030,Here  we report a case of abrupt onset of gross hematuria and nephrotic range proteinuria after the first dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  vaccination  which led to a diagnosis of immunoglobulin A nephropathy  IgAN   A Japanese woman in their forties with a significant medical history of occult blood by urine dipstick test  over the past 3 years  presented with fever  chills  shivering  marked thrombocytopenia  and gross hematuria 9 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine  Pfizer  against SARS-CoV-2 infection  Although thrombotic microangiopathy  TMA  was first suspected as the cause of the severe thrombocytopenia  TMA was clinically excluded after two sessions of plasma exchange were performed  Renal biopsy was performed as the patient s platelet count improved  We made a diagnosis of acute worsening IgAN  triggered by the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  In this case  we speculated that vaccine-induced immune activation may be involved in the exacerbation of occult IgAN  leading to the definite diagnosis  We should pay more attention to the development worsening of clinically significant kidney disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination not only in those with known glomerular disease but also in those with only mild urinary abnormality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988883

1934,BACKGROUND  The opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome  OMAS  represents a pathophysiology and diagnostic challenge  Although the diverse etiologies likely share a common mechanism to generate ocular  trunk  and limb movements  the underlying cause may be a paraneoplastic syndrome  as the first sign of cancer  or may be a postinfectious complication  and thus  the outcome depends on identifying the trigger mechanism  A recent hypothesis suggests increased GABAA receptor sensitivity in the olivary-oculomotor vermis-fastigial nucleus-premotor saccade burst neuron circuit in the brainstem  Therefore  OMAS management will focus on immunosuppression and modulation of GABAA hypersensitivity with benzodiazepines  METHODS  We serially video recorded the eye movements at the bedside of 1 patient with SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin G  IgG  serum antibodies  but twice-negative nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR   We tested cerebrospinal fluid  CSF   serum  and nasopharyngeal samples  After brain MRI and chest  abdomen  and pelvis CT scans  we treated our patient with clonazepam and high-dose Solu-MEDROL  followed by a rituximab infusion after her formal eye movement analysis 10 days later  RESULTS  The recordings throughout her acute illness demonstrated different eye movement abnormalities  While on high-dose steroids and clonazepam  she initially had macrosaccadic oscillations  followed by brief ocular flutter during convergence the next day  after 10 days  she had bursts of opsoclonus during scotopic conditions with fixation block but otherwise normal eye movements  Concern for a suboptimal response to high-dose Solu-MEDROL motivated an infusion of rituximab  which induced remission  An investigation for a paraneoplastic etiology was negative  CSF testing showed elevated neuron-specific enolase  Serum IgG to Serum SARS-CoV2 IgG was elevated with negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal testing  CONCLUSION  A recent simulation model of macrosaccadic oscillations and OMAS proposes a combined pathology of brainstem and cerebellar because of increased GABAA receptor sensitivity  In this case report  we report 1 patient with elevated CSF neuronal specific enolase  macrosaccadic oscillations  ocular flutter  and OMAS as a SARS-CoV-2 postinfectious complication  Opsoclonus emerged predominantly with fixation block and suppressed with fixation  providing support to modern theories on the mechanism responsible for these ocular oscillations involving cerebellar-brainstem pathogenesis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974489

2996,Background  Aging influences COVID-19 severity and response to vaccination  but previous vaccine effectiveness  VE  analyzes lack the power to evaluate its role in subgroups within the elderly age group  Here we analyzed the impact of age on viral vector and inactivated virus vaccines  effectiveness  the main platforms used in low- and middle-income countries  Methods  We report a retrospective longitudinal study of 75 919 840 Brazilian vaccinees from January 18 to July 24  2021  evaluating documented infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   COVID-19-related hospitalisation  ICU admission  and death  Negative binomial regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics were used for VE estimation  Findings  The overall analyzes of full vaccination showed VE against hospitalisation  ICU admission  and death of 91 4   95 CI 90 1-92 5   91 1   95 CI 88 9-92 9  and 92 3   95 CI 90 5-93 7  for Vaxzevria and 71 2   95 CI 70 0-72 4   72 2   95 CI 70 2-74 0  and 73 7   95 CI 72 1-75 2  for CoronaVac  respectively  VE for all outcomes is progressively lower with age  In fully-Vaxzevria-vaccinated individuals aged <60 years  VE against death was 96 5   95 CI 82 1-99 3  versus 68 5   95 CI 40 0-83 4  in those >  90 years  Among fully-CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals  VE against death was 84 8   95 CI 77 1-89 9  in those <60 years compared to 63 5  95 CI 58 7-67 7  for vaccinees aged 80-89 years and 48 6    95 CI 35 0-59 3  for individuals aged >  90 years  Post-vaccination daily cumulative incidence curves for all outcomes showed increased risk from younger to elder decades of life  There was no increase in the incidence of hospitalisation for individuals <60 years vaccinated during the same period as those aged >  90 years  Interpretation  Although both vaccines have been effective in protecting against infection  hospitalization and death  Vaxzevria and CoronaVac demonstrated high effectiveness against severe outcomes for individuals up to 79 years of age  Our results reinforce the idea that booster doses should be carefully considered in elders  Funding  This study was partially supported by a donation from the  Fazer o bem faz bem  program,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957437
4618,BACKGROUND  The McIsaac criteria are a validated scoring system used to determine the likelihood of an acute sore throat being caused by group A streptococcus  GAS  to stratify patients who need strep testing  OBJECTIVE  We aim to compare McIsaac criteria obtained during face-to-face  f2f  and non-f2f encounters  METHODS  This retrospective study compared the percentage of positive GAS tests by McIsaac score for scores calculated during nurse protocol phone encounters  e-visits  electronic visits   and in person f2f clinic visits  RESULTS  There was no difference in percentages of positive strep tests between encounter types for any of the McIsaac scores  There were significantly more phone and e-visit encounters with any missing score components compared with f2f visits  For individual score components  there were significantly fewer e-visits missing fever and cough information compared with phone encounters and f2f encounters  F2f encounters were significantly less likely to be missing descriptions of tonsils and lymphadenopathy compared with phone and e-visit encounters  McIsaac scores of 4 had positive GAS rates of 55  to 68  across encounter types  There were 4 encounters not missing any score components with a McIsaac score of 0  None of these 4 encounters had a positive GAS test  CONCLUSIONS  McIsaac scores of 4 collected during non-f2f care could be used to consider empiric treatment for GAS without testing if significant barriers to testing exist such as the COVID-19 pandemic or geographic barriers  Future studies should evaluate further whether non-f2f encounters with McIsaac scores of 0 can be safely excluded from GAS testing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932016

2245,The BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has demonstrated high efficacy in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19  in randomized placebo-controlled Phase III trials in persons aged 12-17 years  referred to as adolescents in this report   1   however  data on real-word vaccine effectiveness  VE  among adolescents are limited  1-3   As of December 2021  the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  for adolescents aged 16-17 years and under FDA emergency use authorization for those aged 12-15 years  In a prospective cohort in Arizona  243 adolescents aged 12-17 years were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  each week  irrespective of symptoms  and upon onset of COVID-19-like illness during July 25-December 4  2021  the SARS-CoV-2 B 1 617 2  Delta  variant was the predominant strain during this study period  During the study  190 adolescents contributed fully vaccinated person-time  >  14 days after receiving 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine   30 contributed partially vaccinated person-time  receipt of 1 dose or receipt of 2 doses but with the second dose completed <14 days earlier   and 66 contributed unvaccinated person-time  Using the Cox proportional-hazards model  the estimated VE of full Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection was 92   95  CI   79 -97    adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics  health information  frequency of social contact  mask use  location  and local virus circulation  These findings from a real-world setting indicate that 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among Arizona adolescents  CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible persons in the United States  including persons aged 12-17 years,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968373
4447,Introduction  While SARS-CoV-2 s main transmission route is through respiratory droplets  research has found that viral RNA could be detected in blood samples  causing concerns over the safety of blood donations and blood products  This paper therefore aims to systematically search for studies that have addressed their country s lack of donations and analyse the risk of blood transfusion-transmission  As such  it will answer the question  should blood services focus more on donation vigilance or worry more about the risks of transmission through blood products   Methods  38 articles were identified through a systematic review adopting the PRISMA and STROBE guidelines  Meta-analysis was conducted using OpenMeta software  Results  The average decrease in blood donations was found to be 38   with some regions showing up to 67  decrease  To assess the risk of actual blood transfusion-transmission  three datasets were analysed  Firstly  the viral load in COVID-19 patients was studied and found to have less than 1  detection rate  ARD   -0 831  95  -0 963  -0 699   Secondly  the prevalence of finding viral RNA in a pool of donations was nearly -1 503  ARD   -1 538  -1 468   Lastly  recipients who were given blood products of positive donors were found to be -0 911  ARD 95    -1 247  -0 575   Discussion Conclusion  Blood centres should focus more on launching initiatives and policies that would increase their countries  blood supply as the virus has no direct threat to blood safety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934412
694,SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe placental lesions leading rapidly to intra uterine fetal death  IUFD   From August 2020 to September 2021  in the pathology Department of Toulouse Oncopole  we analyzed 50 placentas from COVID-19 positive unvaccinated mothers  The purpose of our study is to describe the clinicopathological characteristics of these placental damages and to understand the pathophysiology  Ten of them  20   showed placental lesions with positive immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 in villous trophoblast  In five cases  10    we observed massive placental damage associating trophoblastic necrosis  fibrinous deposits  intervillositis as well as extensive hemorrhagic changes due to SARS-CoV-2 infection probably responsible of IUFD by functional placental insufficiency  In five other cases  we found similar placental lesions but with a focal distribution that did not lead to IUFD but live birth  These lesions are independent of maternal clinical severity of COVID-19 infection since they occur despite mild maternal symptoms and are therefore difficult to predict  In our cases  they occurred 1 to 3 weeks after positive SARS-CoV-2 maternal RT-PCR testing and were observed in 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancies  When these lesions are focal  they do not lead to IUFD and can be involved in intra-uterine growth restriction  Our findings  together with recent observations  suggest that future pregnancy guidance should include stricter pandemic precautions such as screening for a wider array of COVID-19 symptoms  enhanced ultrasound monitoring as well as newborn medical surveillance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995674

353,We study precautionary saving in a two-period model that allows for nonlinear risks and nonseparable preferences  Permitting nonlinear risk effects is important because they are common in the developing world or when worldwide shocks hit economies  like the COVID-19 pandemic  Allowing nonseparable preferences is also important because they admit the incorporation of intergenerational transfer  habit persistence and other specific features of intertemporal decision making  We decompose the risk shock using Davis s  Int Econ Rev 30 1  131-136  1989  compensation method and analyze the income and substitution effect of an increase in risk  We prove that the substitution effect is always negative and  therefore  the income effect must be positive and larger in size to have a precautionary net effect  We then apply the method to various sources of risk  such as income  interest rate and wealth risk  We analyze the magnitude of each effect and find the conditions required to guarantee precautionary saving in each case  Our results are presented as signs of covariances  which provides a new perspective on precautionary saving,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002083
7913,Flexible sensors have attracted extensive attention because of their promising applications in the fields of health monitoring  intelligent robots  and electronic skin  etc  During the COVID-19 epidemic  noncontact control of public equipment such as elevators  game consoles  and doors has become particularly important  as it can effectively reduce the risk of cross-infection  In this work  a noncontact flexible temperature sensor is prepared via a simple dip-drying progress  in which poly 3 4-ethylenedioxythiophene  poly 4-styrene sulfonate   PEDOT PSS  and printer paper served as the sensing material and the flexible substrate  respectively  We combined the highly sensitive temperature-responsive property of PEDOT PSS with the good hygroscopicity of printer paper  The prepared sensor shows high sensitivity and good stability in noncontact sensing mode within the temperature range of 20-50 degrees C  To prove the practicability of the noncontact temperature sensor  a 3 x 2 sensing array is prepared as a noncontact human-machine interface to realize the interaction between player and  Pound-A-Mole game  and a Bluetooth car  These two demos show the sensor s ability to perceive nearby temperature changes  verifying its application potential as a noncontact human-machine interaction interface,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34885268

2676,Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions  NPIs   aimed at reducing the diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic  have dramatically influenced our everyday behaviour  In this work  we study how individuals adapted their daily movements and person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the NPIs  We leverage longitudinal GPS mobility data of hundreds of thousands of anonymous individuals to empirically show and quantify the dramatic disruption in people s mobility habits and social behaviour  We find that local interventions did not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people experience them  Individuals spend less time in venues  preferring simpler and more predictable routines  also reducing person-to-person contacts  Moreover  we find that the individual patterns of visits are influenced by the strength of the NPIs policies  the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation factor  which increases the people s mobility regardless of the stringency of interventions  Finally  despite the gradual recovery in visit patterns  we find that individuals continue to keep person-to-person contacts low  This apparent conflict hints that the evolution of policy adherence should be carefully addressed by policymakers  epidemiologists and mobility experts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961773

2389,In response to the COVID-19 pandemic  governments around the world have implemented public health policies that limit individual freedoms in order to control disease transmission  While such limitations on liberties are sometimes necessary for pandemic control  many of these policies have been overly broad or have neglected to consider the costs for populations already susceptible to human rights violations  Furthermore  the pandemic has exacerbated preexisting inequities based on health care access  poverty  racial injustice  refugee crises  and lack of education  The worsening of such human rights violations increases the need to utilize a human rights approach in the response to COVID-19  This paper provides a global overview of COVID-19 public health policy interventions implemented from January 1 to June 30  2020  and identifies their impacts on the human rights of marginalized populations  We find that over 70  of these public health policies negatively affect human rights in at least one way or for at least one population  We recommend that policy makers take a human rights approach to COVID-19 pandemic control by designing public health policies focused on the most marginalized groups in society  Doing so would allow for a more equitable  realistic  and sustainable pandemic response that is centered on the needs of those at highest risk of COVID-19 and human rights violations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966234

5839,IgA nephropathy  IgAN  remains one of the most common forms of glomerulonephritis  especially in developed countries with a low prevalence of infectious diseases  Despite supportive measures that slow the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease  CKD  in IgAN  many patients still progress to end-stage kidney disease  Proteinuria has been shown to be an adverse prognostic factor in IgAN  Data support the use of proteinuria reduction as a reasonably likely surrogate endpoint for a treatment s effect on progression to end-stage renal disease  ESRD  in IgAN  Currently employed immunosuppressive strategies lack conclusive efficacy data  while there is evidence for treatment-induced toxicity  The current standard of care for the management of IgAN is intensive goal-directed supportive care  Recently the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2  SGLT2  inhibitors in decreasing proteinuria and progression of CKD is widely being recognized  In this case report  we present a 44-year-old male with proteinuria and biopsy-proven IgAN who remained in remission after six months of steroids using the Pozzi protocol  He developed proteinuria five years after remission  At this point  canagliflozin was added to his angiotensin-receptor blocker  ARB  therapy resulting in a significant reduction in his proteinuria  Our case report may intrigue researchers to look into the role of canagliflozin in decreasing albuminuria in non-diabetic kidney disease  thus slowing the progression to ESRD,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912597
5747,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   is a global public health emergency  Several vaccine candidates have been developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  One approach is to construct live-recombinant viruses expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  S  as vaccine candidates  The vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  vector is a mature vaccine platform which was successfully developed as a vaccine against Ebola virus  EBOV   leading to its licensure by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  in December 2019  Based on this work  we developed two live  replication-competent VSV-vectored vaccines against SARS-CoV-2   1  a VSV expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and  2  a bivalent VSV expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the glycoprotein  GP  of EBOV  This protocol describes the methodologies for the design  cloning  rescue  and preparation of these recombinant VSV vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914048
2894,The lack of medication to treat COVID-19 is still an obstacle that needs to be addressed by all possible scientific approaches  It is essential to design newer drugs with varied approaches  A receptor-binding domain  RBD  is a key part of SARS-CoV-2 virus  located on its surface  that allows it to dock to ACE2 receptors present on human cells  which is followed by admission of virus into cells  and thus infection is triggered  Specific receptor-binding domains on the spike protein play a pivotal role in binding to the receptor  In this regard  the in silico method plays an important role  as it is more rapid and cost effective than the trial and error methods using experimental studies  A combination of virtual screening  molecular docking  molecular simulations and machine learning techniques are applied on a library of natural compounds to identify ligands that show significant binding affinity at the hydrophobic pocket of the RBD  A list of ligands with high binding affinity was obtained using molecular docking and molecular dynamics  MD  simulations for protein-ligand complexes  Machine learning  ML  classification schemes have been applied to obtain features of ligands and important descriptors  which help in identification of better binding ligands  A plethora of descriptors were used for training the self-organizing map algorithm  The model brings out descriptors important for protein-ligand interactions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959727
1328,A new coronavirus pandemic  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has been on the rise  This virus is fatal for broad groups of populations  including elderly  men  and patients with comorbidities among which obesity is a possible risk factor  The pathophysiologic connections between obesity metainflammation and COVID-19 may be directly related to increasing soluble ACE2  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  levels which potentiates the viral entrance into the host cells  or indirectly related to dysregulation of immune system  microvascular injury and hypercoagulability  The SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein interacts mainly with ACE2 or possibly DDP4 receptors to enter into the host cells  The host proteases  especially TMPRSS2  transmembrane protease serine 2   support the fusion process and virus entry  While membranous ACE2 is considered a port of entry to the cell for SARS-CoV-2  it seems that soluble ACE2 retains its virus binding capability and enhances its entry into the cells  Interestingly  ACE2 on cell membrane may have protective roles by diminishing cytokine storm-related injuries to the organs  Applying medications that can reduce soluble ACE2 levels  antagonizing TMPRSS2 or blocking DDP4 can improve the outcomes of COVID-19  Metformin and statins through immunomodulatory activities  Orlistat by reducing viral replication  and thiazolidinediones by upregulating ACE2 expression have potential beneficial effects against COVID-19  However  the combination of dipeptidyl peptidase-4  DDP4  inhibitors and spironolactone eplerenone seems to be more effective by reducing soluble ACE2 level  antagonizing TMPRSS2  maintaining ACE2 on cell membrane and reducing risk of viral entry into the cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983356

594,Global scarcity of COVID-19 vaccines raises ethical questions about their fair allocation between nations  Section I introduces the question and proposes that wealthy nations have a duty of justice to share globally scarce COVID-19 vaccines  Section II distinguishes justice from charity and argues that beneficiaries of unjust structures incur duties of justice when they are systematically advantaged at others expense  Section III gives a case-based argument describing three upstream structural injustices that systematically advantaged wealthy countries and disadvantaged poorer countries  contributing to global disparities of COVID-19 vaccines  Section IV examines more closely the duties of justice owed  including a duty to relinquish holdings  restitute victims  and restore relationships  Section V concludes that wealthy nations have a duty of justice to share COVID-19 vaccines with poor nations and to restore relationships damaged by injustice  All nations should take steps to transform unjust structures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997810
2919,The perspective of using messenger RNA  mRNA  as a therapeutic molecule first faced some uncertainties due to concerns about its instability and the feasibility of large-scale production  Today  given technological advances and deeper biomolecular knowledge  these issues have started to be addressed and some strategies are being exploited to overcome the limitations  Thus  the potential of mRNA has become increasingly recognized for the development of new innovative therapeutics  envisioning its application in immunotherapy  regenerative medicine  vaccination  and gene editing  Nonetheless  to fully potentiate mRNA therapeutic application  its efficient production  stabilization and delivery into the target cells are required  In recent years  intensive research has been carried out in this field in order to bring new and effective solutions towards the stabilization and delivery of mRNA  Presently  the therapeutic potential of mRNA is undoubtedly recognized  which was greatly reinforced by the results achieved in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic  but there are still some issues that need to be improved  which are critically discussed in this review,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959371
31,Parents of infants and young children who experience harsh circumstances are among those most vulnerable to the added stressors associated with COVID-19  Home visiting models have been shown to enhance outcomes for parents and infants when delivered in person  but in many parts of the world  the pandemic rendered in-person home visits difficult or impossible  In this special section  we examine adaptations made by home visiting programs to allow continued service delivery through telehealth  and strategies for assessing whether interventions maintain reach and fidelity when implemented remotely  In the first paper  Bullinger et al   program implementers of SafeCare  provide evidence of the increased risk of maltreatment during COVID-19 for many families  and thus the need for home visiting services  Rybinska et al   developers and implementers of Family Connects  present evidence regarding their success in reaching families through telehealth  Roben and colleagues  in the third paper  report that clinicians implementing Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up through telehealth maintained fidelity at similar rates seen through in-person implementation  Finally  Tabachnick et al  describe procedures for collecting physiological data from infants and parents while conducting assessments remotely,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007378
6087,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is the causative agent of the highly infectious coronavirus disease COVID-19  Extensive research has been performed in recent months to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 infects and manipulates its host to identify potential drug targets and support patient recovery from COVID-19  However  the function of many SARS-CoV-2 proteins remains uncharacterised  Here we used the Synthetic Physical Interactions  SPI  method to recruit SARS-CoV-2 proteins to most of the budding yeast proteome to identify conserved pathways which are affected by SARS-CoV-2 proteins  The set of yeast proteins that result in growth defects when associated with the viral proteins have homologous functions that overlap those identified in studies performed in mammalian cells  Specifically  we were able to show that recruiting the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 protein to HOPS  a vesicle-docking complex  is sufficient to perturb membrane trafficking in yeast consistent with the hijacking of the endoplasmic-reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment trafficking pathway during viral infection of mammalian cells  These data demonstrate that the yeast SPI method is a rapid way to identify potential functions of ectopic viral proteins,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909432
6751,Universal platforms for biomolecular analysis using label-free sensing modalities can address important diagnostic challenges  Electrical field effect-sensors are an important class of devices that can enable point-of-care sensing by probing the charge in the biological entities  Use of crumpled graphene for this application is especially promising  It is previously reported that the limit of detection  LoD  on electrical field effect-based sensors using DNA molecules on the crumpled graphene FET  field-effect transistor  platform  Here  the crumpled graphene FET-based biosensing of important biomarkers including small molecules and proteins is reported  The performance of devices is systematically evaluated and optimized by studying the effect of the crumpling ratio on electrical double layer  EDL  formation and bandgap opening on the graphene  It is also shown that a small and electroneutral molecule dopamine can be captured by an aptamer and its conformation change induced electrical signal changes  Three kinds of proteins were captured with specific antibodies including interleukin-6  IL-6  and two viral proteins  All tested biomarkers are detectable with the highest sensitivity reported on the electrical platform  Significantly  two COVID-19 related proteins  nucleocapsid  N-  and spike  S-  proteins antigens are successfully detected with extremely low LoDs  This electrical antigen tests can contribute to the challenge of rapid  point-of-care diagnostics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901384
4993,Objectives  During the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  self-quarantine period  the transition to online-course has profoundly changed the learning modes of millions of school-aged children and put them at an increased risk of asthenopia  Therefore  we aimed to determine associations of the total screen online-course time with asthenopia prevalence among that children during the COVID-19 pandemic  and whether the associations were mediated by psychological stress  Methods  Asthenopia was defined according to a validated computer vision syndrome questionnaire  CVS-Q   We used CVS-Q to collect the frequency and intensity of 16 asthenopia-related eye symptoms of 25 781 children  Demographic features  eye care habits  visual disorders  lifestyle  psychological and environmental factors  were also collected  Results  The overall asthenopia prevalence was 12 1   varying from 5 4 to 18 2  across grade gender-classified subgroups  A 100-h increment of total screen online-course time were associated with an increased risk of asthenopia by 9   odds ratio  OR    1 09  and 11   OR   1 11   respectively  Mediation analysis showed that the proportions of total effects mediated by psychological stress were 23 5 and 38 1   respectively  Age  female gender  having myopia or astigmatism  bad habits when watching screens were also risk factors  Conversely  keeping 34-65 cm between eyes and screen  increased rest time between classes  and increased eye exercise were all associated with a decreased risk  Conclusion  Our study indicated that the influence of long total screen or online-course time on psychological stress increases asthenopia risk  The findings of this study have provided a new avenue for intervening screen-related asthenopia in addition to incorporating a reasonable schedule of online courses into educational policy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926368
4656,BACKGROUND  The efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma  CCP  for preventing infection in exposed  uninfected individuals is unknown  We hypothesized that CCP might prevent infection when administered before symptoms or laboratory evidence of infection  METHODS  This double-blinded  phase 2 randomized  controlled trial  RCT  compared the efficacy and safety of prophylactic high titer  >  1 320  CCP with standard plasma  Asymptomatic participants aged >  18 years with close contact exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19 in the previous 120 hours and negative SARS-CoV-2 test within 24 hours before transfusion were eligible  The primary outcome was development of SARS-CoV-2 infection  RESULTS  180 participants were enrolled  87 were assigned to CCP and 93 to control plasma  and 170 transfused at 19 sites across the United States from June 2020 to March 2021  Two were excluded for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity at screening  Of the remaining 168 participants  12 81  14 8   CCP and 13 87  14 9   control recipients developed SARS-CoV-2 infection  6  7 4   CCP and 7  8   control recipients developed COVID-19  infection with symptoms   There were no COVID-19-related hospitalizations in CCP and 2 in control recipients  There were 28 adverse events in CCP and 58 in control recipients  Efficacy by restricted mean infection free time  RMIFT  by 28 days for all SARS-CoV-2 infections  25 3 vs  25 2 days  p 0 49  and COVID-19  26 3 vs  25 9 days  p 0 35  were similar for both groups  CONCLUSION  In this trial  which enrolled persons with recent exposure to a person with confirmed COVID-19  high titer CCP as post-exposure prophylaxis appeared safe  but did not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection  Trial Registration  Clinicaltrial gov number NCT04323800,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931202

8889,Sweden s use of soft response measures early in the COVID-19 pandemic received a good deal of international attention  Within Sweden  one of the most debated aspects of the pandemic response has been COVID-19 testing and the time it took to increase testing capacity  In this article  the development of and the debate surrounding COVID-19 testing in Sweden during 2020 is described in detail  with a particular focus on the coordination between national and regional actors in the decentralised healthcare system  A qualitative case study was carried out based on qualitative document analysis with a chronological presentation  To understand COVID-19 testing in Sweden  two aspects of its public administration model emerged as particularly important   i  the large and independent government agencies and  ii  self-governing regions and municipalities  In addition  the responsibility principle in Swedish crisis management was crucial  Overall  the results show that mass testing was a new area for coordination and involved a number of national and regional actors with partly different views on their respective roles  responsibilities and interpretations of the laws and regulations  The description shows the ambiguities in the purpose of testing and the shortcomings in communication and cooperation during the first half of 2020  but after that an increasing consistency among the crucial actors  During the first half of 2020  testing capacity in Sweden was limited and reserved to protect the most vulnerable in society  Because mass testing for viruses is not normally carried out by the 21 self-governing regions responsible for healthcare and communicable disease prevention  and the Public Health Agency of Sweden stated that there was no medical reason to test members of the public falling ill with COVID-like symptoms  the responsibility for mass testing fell through the cracks during the first few months of the pandemic  This article thus illustrates problems associated with multi-level governance in healthcare during a crisis and illustrates the discrepancy between the health service s focus on the individual and the public health-oriented work carried out within communicable disease control,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869171
9476,First cases that point at a correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infections and the development of Parkinson s disease  PD  have been reported  Currently  it is unclear if there is also a direct causal link between these diseases  To obtain first insights into a possible molecular relation between viral infections and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein into amyloid fibrils characteristic for PD  we investigated the effect of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on alpha-synuclein aggregation  We show  in test tube experiments  that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  S-protein  has no effect on alpha-synuclein aggregation  while SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein  N-protein  considerably speeds up the aggregation process  We observe the formation of multiprotein complexes and eventually amyloid fibrils  Microinjection of N-protein in SH-SY5Y cells disturbed the alpha-synuclein proteostasis and increased cell death  Our results point toward direct interactions between the N-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and alpha-synuclein as molecular basis for the observed correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infections and Parkinsonism,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860005

7713,Background and objectives  Most studies to date have focused on the negative aspects of anxiety  Anxiety  however  is an evolved emotional response that can provide protection in the face of risk  Pandemics are characterized by increased mortality risk coupled with future uncertainties  which both cause heightened anxiety  Here  we examine the factors associated with anxiety levels and risk avoidance behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  We asked how individual time perspectives  future-oriented consideration and attention to present moment experience  affect anxiety in uncertain times  and whether anxiety reduces mortality risk by promoting risk avoidance behaviour  Methodology  We conducted an online survey in the UK  N   1088  and Turkey  N   3935  and measured participants  generalized and pandemic-related anxiety levels  future-oriented consideration  mindfulness  intolerance of uncertainty  risk perception and risk avoidance behaviours  Results  We found that people less tolerant of uncertainties had higher levels of pandemic anxiety  Those with higher pandemic anxiety exhibited risk avoidance behaviours more frequently  Mindfulness and increased financial satisfaction reduced pandemic anxiety  People in Turkey reported higher levels of generalized and pandemic anxiety and greater engagement in risk avoidance behaviours than people in the UK  Conclusions and implications  Our study shows an elevated anxiety response can help mitigate infection risk during pandemics and emphasizes the importance of the underlying situation in understanding whether an anxiety response is adaptive or pathological  Maintaining a healthy level of anxiety can promote engagement in protective behaviours  Therapies addressing anxiety can focus on increasing tolerance to future uncertainties  Lay summary  Anxiety is an emotional response triggered in the anticipation of a possible threat  We found that intolerance of uncertainty strongly predicted anxiety and that people with elevated anxiety levels engaged in protective behaviours more frequently during the COVID-19 pandemic  suggesting that anxiety can help mitigate mortality risk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888056
2149,Alternative metrics are unique bibliometrics comprising social  news  and other sources of media outside of traditional academic citations  Some have suggested that these metrics can complement traditional metrics of research impact  including public engagement with research  The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study alternative metrics and the dissemination of scientific research given the heightened academic and public interest  This study analyzed Altmetric Attention Scores for the top 25 publications on COVID-19 and the top 25 non-COVID-19 publications in 2020  There were significantly higher levels of social attention scores across multiple metrics for COVID-19 articles than for non-COVID-19 articles for that year  There was a slightly higher goodness of fit between Altmetric Attention Scores and academic citations for COVID-19 publications than for non-COVID-19 publications  although trendline differences were not significant  These results suggest that researchers should be aware that their studies can become highly visible on publicly available social and news media platforms  especially during events of high interest  such as a global pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970030
1656,Purpose  Childhood obesity is a global epidemic and a chronic disease  Multifactorial determinants have long been linked with childhood obesity  These have been challenged with the onset of COVID-19 and the associated mitigation measures  The study aimed to re-highlight these determinants while exploring the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on these pre-existing childhood obesity determinants  while providing evidence that may be beneficial for the post-COVID-19 recovery plan  Methods  A PubMed literature search  2016-2021  using the keywords   childhood obesity    gender    sex    obesity in youth    obesity in adolescents    COVID-19   and  SARS-CoV2  was performed  Results  Genetic predisposition  biologically low leptin levels  certain cultural beliefs and socio-economic statuses  as well as exposure to an  obesogenic  environment were found to have a positive association with childhood obesity  Additionally  the onset of COVID-19 further aggravates the childhood obesity epidemic  increasing childrens  susceptibility to obesity and all associated consequential diseases  Discussion  A possible key to the control and prevention of the burden of childhood obesity  lies in dealing with its precursors and risk factors  Certain factors  including socio-cultural norms  cultural beliefs and geographical factors are amenable  COVID-19 further challenged these and it is evident that the childhood obesity epidemic is still a critical one  Encouraging preventative interventions  such as screening programs  public awareness and policies targeting the environment  amongst others  are recommended,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977915
3254,BACKGROUND  Vaccination coverage of dose two of MMR  MMR2  at 5th birthday has been consistently low in London and measured 76 3  in 2018 19  Since the early 2000s seven boroughs in London started offering dose two earlier  from 15 to 18 months onwards instead of the recommended 3 years 4 months  In this study we investigate whether the accelerated schedule of MMR2 leads to a change in coverage of MMR2 and other childhood vaccines with an ecological study using childhood immunisation data from 2009 to 2018 in London  METHODS  We modelled coverage used generalized estimating equations  GEE  adjusted for year and DTaP IPV Hib3 coverage measured at 2nd birthday as a proxy for baseline local vaccination programme performance to determine the percentage point difference in coverage of MMR2 and other childhood vaccines  RESULTS  Average MMR2 coverage was higher among early implementing boroughs from 2012 13 onwards  Coverage difference was highest in 2017 18  9 2 percentage points  95  CI 4 8  13 5  p < 0 001   On average over the 6 years  compared to London boroughs on the routine schedule  MMR2 coverage among early implementing boroughs was 3 3 percentage points higher  95  CI 1 3  5 3  p   0 01  after adjusting for DTaP IPV Hib3 coverage  IMD score and year  CONCLUSION  Earlier vaccination of MMR2 is associated with significantly higher coverage at five years for this vaccine in London  Further research is needed to assess the association at a more granular level  but our findings underline a potential opportunity to increase MMR coverage,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955326

3834,The COVID-19 pandemic drastically highlighted the vulnerability of the elderly population towards viral and other infectious threats  illustrating that aging is accompanied by dysregulated immune responses currently summarized in terms like inflammaging and immunoparalysis  To gain a better understanding on the underlying mechanisms of the age-associated risk of adverse outcome in individuals experiencing a SARS-CoV-2 infection  we analyzed the impact of age on circulating monocyte phenotypes  activation markers and inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6  IL-6   IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor  TNF  in the context of COVID-19 disease progression and outcome in 110 patients  Our data indicate no age-associated differences in peripheral monocyte counts or subset composition  However  age and outcome are associated with differences in monocyte activation status  Moreover  a distinct cytokine pattern of IL-6  IL-8 and TNF in elderly survivors versus non-survivors  which consolidates over the time of hospitalization  suggests that older patients with adverse outcomes experience an inappropriate immune response  reminiscent of an inflammaging driven immunoparalysis  Our study underscores the value  necessity and importance of longitudinal monitoring in elderly COVID-19 patients  as dynamic changes after symptom onset can be observed  which allow for a differentiated insight into confounding factors that impact the complex pathogenesis following an infection with SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943881
9851,PURPOSE  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our health systems and delivery of care and on the disruption of medical education  It has forced hospitals to move to a telehealth model for prenatal and postpartum visits and expedite discharges for postpartum patients in order to reduce exposure  We describe our medical school and hospital system initiative to employ medical student volunteers for postpartum telehealth calls during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City  DESCRIPTION  Ten medical students conducted phone interviews with postpartum patients within 72 h of discharge at three hospitals in a large NYC health system  with faculty preceptors at each site who provided daily call assignments and oversight  Students called patients to screen for risk factors for postpartum complications  including preeclampsia and postpartum depression  provide additional contraception counseling  and address newborn care and health  One week and 2 week post-discharge calls were also made for COVID-19 positive patients for ongoing symptom monitoring and counseling  ASSESSMENT  We found numerous opportunities for intervention in postpartum health via telehealth  including addressing pharmacy-related needs  patient counseling  improving pain management  and identifying patients in need of emergent re-evaluation  CONCLUSION  As this pandemic continues to evolve  our model demonstrates the feasibility of telehealth and medical student involvement in postpartum care and its benefits to patients  medical student learning  and alleviation of burden on obstetric staff,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34854027

8181,INTRODUCTION  Although there are many studies on the use of convalescent plasma  CP  for treatment of COVID-19  it is not clear  1  which groups of patients may benefit   2  what dose of plasma to give  or  3  which antibody levels the plasma should contain  Previous phase I II studies and literature review suggest that CP should only be given to patients with viraemia  that a daily infusion should be given until the patient becomes virus free and that the neutralising antibody titre should preferably be >1 640 METHODS AND ANALYSIS  An open randomised controlled trial enrolling patients with COVID-19  who must be SARS-CoV-2 positive in both airway and blood samples and admitted to a study hospital  Block randomisation 2 1 is to either 200 mL CP  preferably titre >  1 640  daily for up to 10 days  until virus negative in blood  plus standard care or standard care only  control arm   The primary endpoint is mortality by day 28 after study inclusion  Secondary endpoints include mortality by day 60 and doses of plasma needed to clear viraemia  Assuming a reduced mortality of approximately 30  by the CP therapy and 85 -88  survival in the control arm  approximately 600 participants will be enrolled to the CP therapy arm and 300 participants to the control arm  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  Ethical approval has been granted by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority  reference  2020-06277   Results from this trial will be compiled in a clinical study report  disseminated via journal articles and communicated to stakeholders  TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER  NCT04649879,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880010
1109,Background  Striking similarities have been found between coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5  MDA5  antibody  Ab -related dermatomyositis  implying a shared autoinflammatory aberrance  Herein  we aim to investigate whether the anti-MDA5 Ab is present in COVID-19 and correlates with the severity and adverse outcome of COVID-19 patients  Methods and Findings  We retrospectively recruited 274 adult inpatients with COVID-19 in this study  including 48  164  and 62 cases of deaths  severe  and non-severe patients respectively  The anti-MDA5 Ab was determined by ELISA and verified by Western Blotting  which indicated that the positive rate of anti-MDA5 Ab in COVID-19 patients was 48 2   132 274   The clinical and laboratory features  as well as outcomes between patients with positive and negative anti-MDA5 Ab were compared and we found that the anti-MDA5 Ab positive patients tended to represent severe disease  88 6  vs 66 9   P<0 0001   We also demonstrated that the titer of anti-MDA5 Ab was significantly elevated in the non-survivals  5 95   - 5 16 vs 8 22   - 6 64  P 0 030  and the positive rate was also higher than that in the survivals  23 5  vs 12 0   P 0 012   Regarding severe COVID-19 patients  we found that high titer of anti-MDA5 Ab  >  10 0 U mL  was more prevalent in the non-survivals  31 2  vs 14 0   P 0 006   Moreover  a dynamic analysis of anti-MDA5 Ab was conducted at different time-points of COVID-19  which revealed that early profiling of anti-MDA5 Ab could distinguish severe patients from those with non-severe ones  Conclusions  Anti-MDA5 Ab was prevalent in the COVID-19 patients and high titer of this antibody is correlated with severe disease and unfavorable outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987516
996,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  caused by the emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has set off a global pandemic  There is an urgent unmet need for safe  affordable  and effective therapeutics against COVID-19  In this regard  drug repurposing is considered as a promising approach  We assessed the compounds that affect the endosomal acidic environment by applying human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2 -expressing cells infected with a SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein-pseudotyped HIV reporter virus and identified that obatoclax resulted in the strongest inhibition of S-protein-mediated virus entry  The potent antiviral activity of obatoclax at nanomolar concentrations was confirmed in different human lung and intestinal cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype system as well as clinical virus isolates  Furthermore  we uncovered that obatoclax executes a double-strike against SARS-CoV-2  It prevented SARS-CoV-2 entry by blocking endocytosis of virions through diminished endosomal acidification and the corresponding inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L  Additionally  obatoclax impaired the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion by targeting the MCL-1 protein and reducing furin protease activity  In accordance with these overarching mechanisms  obatoclax blocked the virus entry mediated by different S proteins derived from several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as  Alpha  B 1 1 7   Beta  B 1 351   and Delta  B 1 617 2   Taken together  our results identified obatoclax as a novel effective antiviral compound that keeps SARS-CoV-2 at bay by blocking both endocytosis and membrane fusion  Our data suggested that obatoclax should be further explored as clinical drug for the treatment of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989664
1683,The growing dependency on digital technologies is becoming a way of life  and at the same time  the collection of data using them for surveillance operations has raised concerns  Notably  some countries use digital surveillance technologies for tracking and monitoring individuals and populations to prevent the transmission of the new coronavirus  The technology has the capacity to contribute towards tackling the pandemic effectively  but the success also comes at the expense of privacy rights  The crucial point to make is regardless of who uses and which mechanism  in one way another will infringe personal privacy  Therefore  when considering the use of technologies to combat the pandemic  the focus should also be on the impact of facial recognition cameras  police surveillance drones  and other digital surveillance devices on the privacy rights of those under surveillance  The GDPR was established to ensure that information could be shared without causing any infringement on personal data and businesses  therefore  in generating Big Data  it is important to ensure that the information is securely collected  processed  transmitted  stored  and accessed in accordance with established rules  This paper focuses on Big Data challenges associated with surveillance methods used within the COVID-19 parameters  The aim of this research is to propose practical solutions to Big Data challenges associated with COVID-19 pandemic surveillance approaches  To that end  the researcher will identify the surveillance measures being used by countries in different regions  the sensitivity of generated data  and the issues associated with the collection of large volumes of data and finally propose feasible solutions to protect the privacy rights of the people  during the post-COVID-19 era,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977562
1454,INTRODUCTION  During the COVID-19 pandemic  the redeployment of operating room  OR  staff resulted in a significant ramp-down of elective surgery  To mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on surgical education  this study was planned to estimate the impact of the first wave of the pandemic on the participation of general surgery residency and fellowship trainees in operative procedures  METHODS  This study is a retrospective review of all adult general surgery procedures performed at 3 sites of an academic health care network  Cases performed during the first wave of the pandemic  March-June 2020  were compared to the same period of the previous year pre-pandemic  March-June 2019   Trainees were categorized as junior  Post-Graduate-Year  PGY  1-2   senior  PGY3-5   or fellows  PGY6-7   Operating exposure was defined as  1  the total number of cases attended by at least one trainee and  2  total time spent in the OR by all trainees  hours   The impact of the pandemic was estimated as percentage of baseline  2019   RESULTS  During the first wave of the pandemic  a total of 914 cases were performed  compared to 1328 in the pre-pandemic period  69    Junior trainees were more affected than senior trainees with reductions in both case volume  68  versus 78  of baseline attendance  and time  68  versus 77  of baseline operating time   Minimally invasive surgery fellows were most severely affected trainees and colorectal fellows were least affected  14  and 75  of baseline cases  respectively   Participation in emergency surgery cases and surgical oncology cases was relatively preserved  87  and 105  of baseline  respectively   CONCLUSIONS  The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operative exposure for general surgery trainees by approximately 30   Procedure-specific patterns reflected institutional policies for prioritizing cancer operations and emergency surgeries  These findings may inform the design of remediation activities to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on surgical training,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981225
2360,The novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has impacted health care worldwide  with specific patient populations  such as those with diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and chronic lung disease  at higher risk of infection and others at higher risk of disease progression  Patients with decompensated cirrhosis fall into the latter category and are a unique group that require specific treatment and management decisions because they can develop acute-on-chronic liver failure  In liver transplant recipients  the atypical immunity profile due to immunosuppression protects against downstream inflammatory responses triggered by COVID-19  This exhaustive review discusses the outcomes associated with COVID-19 in patients with advanced cirrhosis and in liver transplant recipients  We focus on the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19  its correlation with the pathogenesis of advanced liver disease  and the effect of immunosuppression in liver transplant recipients to provide insight into the outcomes of this unique patient population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966658

8265,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse impacts on adult mental health and substance use worldwide  Systematic reviews suggest eHealth interventions can be effective at addressing these problems  However  strong positive eHealth outcomes are often tied to the intensity of online therapist guidance  which has cost implications that can make the population scale-up of more effective interventions difficult  A way to offset cost while maintaining the intensity of therapist guidance is to offer eHealth programs to groups rather than more standard one-on-one or asynchronous formats  OBJECTIVE  To examine randomized controlled trial  RCT  evidence for health professional-led group interventions delivered entirely live by videoconference  teleconference  or online chat on mental health  substance use  or bereavement among community-based adults  Within articles selected for our primary aim  we also examined the impact of eHealth interventions that encouraged physical activity on mental health outcomes relative to those that did not  METHODS  Four databases  MEDLINE  CINAHL  PsycINFO  and the Cochrane Library  were searched in July 2020  Eligible studies included RCTs of eHealth interventions targeting mental health  substance use  or bereavement as primary outcomes among community-dwelling adults  Post-intervention data was used to calculate effect size by study  Results were summarized by outcome  eHealth platform  and intervention length  Results were summarized using the SWiM  Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis  guidelines  Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool  RESULTS  Of the 4 099 identified studies  21 RCTs representing 20 interventions met inclusion criteria  The 21 studies examined mental health outcomes among 2 438 participants  sample size range  47 to 361 participants per study  across seven countries  When effects sizes were pooled  live group eHealth interventions led by health professionals had a medium effect on anxiety compared to passive  d   0 57  or active control  d   0 48   a medium to small effect on depression compared to passive  d   0 61  or active control  d   0 21   and mixed effects on mental distress and coping  No eligible RCTs that had examined intervention effects on substance use or bereavement were found  When eHealth platforms were compared  interventions led by videoconference had the most robust effects on mental health  When intervention length was examined  those that provided 8-12 hours of live health professional-led group contact had more robust effects on adult mental health than longer programs  Risk of bias was high in 90 5   19 21  of studies chiefly due to problems blinding participants in behavioral trials  Heterogeneity across interventions was significant  resulting in low to very low quality of evidence  CONCLUSIONS  Live eHealth group interventions led by health professionals can foster moderate improvements in anxiety  and moderate to small improvements in depression among community-based adults  particularly those delivered by videoconference  and those providing 8-12 contact hours of synchronous engagement  CLINICALTRIAL  PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42020187551  https   www crd york ac uk prospero display record php RecordID 187551  INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT  RR2-10 1186 s13643-020-01479-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878409
5628,Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children is a rare form of COVID-19 that affects various organ systems and carries the risk of morbidity and mortality  Cardiac involvement is commonly observed in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children cases  hence  this study was conducted to evaluate the cardiac findings of the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children cases that were diagnosed and followed up in our hospital  MATERIALS AND METHODS  The medical histories  laboratory results  cardiac findings  and treatments of the cases that were diagnosed with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children between December 2020 and August 2021 were evaluated retrospectively  RESULTS  Our study group consisted of 14 males and 12 females whose median age was 3 67 years  Of the 26 patients  24 had echocardiographic findings and 12 cases had cardiac pathologies that were mostly mild  Among these  mitral valve insufficiency  coronary artery pathology  and pericardial effusion were the most common  Perivascular brightness  aortic and tricuspid insufficiency  systolic dysfunction  and tricuspid thrombosis were less common  The cardiac pathologies of all patients resolved in less than a month following treatment  CONCLUSION  Although the cardiac pathologies of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children cases disappear fairly rapidly  the long-term cardiac effects of this disease are not known clearly  To improve our current understanding of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children  more multi-centred studies with long-term follow-up periods should be conducted  and treatment protocols for cases of different severities should be developed to maximise the treatments  efficacy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915942
965,Equal Access to the COVID-19 vaccine for all remains a major public health issue  The current study compared the prevalence of vaccination reluctance in general and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and social and health factors associated with intentions to receive the vaccine  A random socio-epidemiological population-based survey was conducted in France in November 2020  in which 85 855 adults participants were included in this study  We used logistic regressions to study being  not at all in favor  to vaccination in general  and being  certainly not  willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19  Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against COVID-19  OR   1 88  95  CI  1 79-1 97    We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy  in terms of level of education  financial resources  were more likely to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine  from OR   1 22  95  CI 1 10-1 35  for respondents without diploma to OR   0 52  95  CI 0 47-0 57  for High school  5 or more years level   People from the French overseas departments  immigrants and descendants of immigrants  were all more reluctant to the Covid-19 vaccine  first-generation Africa Asia immigrants OR   1 16  95  CI 1 04-1 30   versus OR   2 19  95  CI 1 96-2 43  for the majority population   Finally  our analysis showed that those who reported not trusting the government were more likely to be Covid-19 vaccine-reluctant  OR   3 29  95  CI  3 13-3 45    Specific campaigns should be thought beforehand to reach women and people at the bottom of the social hierarchy to avoid furthering social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34990482
3039,Background and Aims  We evaluated adipose tissue-derived hormones  body composition  serum metabolic profile  levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor  BDNF   and the association of these parameters with the clinical outcome in patients with COVID-19  We sought to examine whether obesity  sex  and age influence the adipose tissue endocrine response to the disease  Methods  This prospective study investigated 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19  Patients were categorized based on their body mass index  BMI   sex and age  and were also classified regarding their outcome after hospitalization as   a  Non-ICU  patients hospitalized who did not receive intensive care   b  ICU-survivor  patients admitted to the intensive care unit and discharged   c  ICU-death  patients who died  Blood samples were collected by the hospital staff between the first and third day of hospitalization  Serum leptin  adiponectin and BDNF concentrations  triglycerides  total cholesterol and cholesterol fractions were performed following the manufacturer s guidelines  Results  We demonstrate that BDNF levels predict intensive care  IC  need  p < 0 01   This association was found to be stronger in patients >60y  p   0 026   Neither leptin nor adiponectin concentration was associated with IC requirement or with patient s outcome  while the BDNF adiponectin ratio was closely associated with worsened outcomes  p < 0 01   BDNF concentration was similar between sexes  however tended to be lower in male patients  p   0 023   In older patients  BDNF concentration was lower than that of younger patients  p   0 020   These age and sex-specific differences should be considered when employing these potential markers for prognosis assessment  While appetite and body composition regulating hormones secreted by the white adipose tissue are not reliable predictors of disease severity  the ratio BDNF adiponectin was indicative of patient status  Conclusion  Thus  we propose that serum BDNF content and BDNF adiponectin ratio may serve as tools predicting worsened prognosis in COVID-19  especially for male patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957187
2729,Uncontrolled inflammatory responses play a critical role in coronavirus disease  COVID-19   In this context  because the triggering-receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1  TREM-1  is considered an intrinsic amplifier of inflammatory signals  this study investigated the role of soluble TREM-1  sTREM-1  as a biomarker of the severity and mortality of COVID-19  Based on their clinical scores  we enrolled COVID-19 positive patients  n   237  classified into mild  moderate  severe  and critical groups  Clinical data and patient characteristics were obtained from medical records  and their plasma inflammatory mediator profiles were evaluated with immunoassays  Plasma levels of sTREM-1 were significantly higher among patients with severe disease compared to all other groups  Additionally  levels of sTREM-1 showed a significant positive correlation with other inflammatory parameters  such as IL-6  IL-10  IL-8  and neutrophil counts  and a significant negative correlation was observed with lymphocyte counts  Most interestingly  sTREM-1 was found to be a strong predictive biomarker of the severity of COVID-19 and was related to the worst outcome and death  Systemic levels of sTREM-1 were significantly correlated with the expression of matrix metalloproteinases  MMP -8  which can release TREM-1 from the surface of peripheral blood cells  Our findings indicated that quantification of sTREM-1 could be used as a predictive tool for disease outcome  thus improving the timing of clinical and pharmacological interventions in patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960790

8360,Introduction  Social media platforms are used by many people to seek and share health-related information that may influence their decision-making about COVID-19 vaccination  Purpose  The objective of this study is to understand the influence of social media on the attitudes and willingness of the general public of the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia to receive COVID-19 vaccination  Materials and Methods  A cross-sectional self-administrated online survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia Aseer region  where 613 persons willingly took part in the survey in April and May 2021  Residents of Aseer in Saudi Arabia  who are over the age of 18  eligible for COVID-19 vaccination  and willing to participate in the survey  were included in the study  Results  Overall  74 6  agreed that the COVID-19 vaccine was misrepresented via social media  However  37  of those respondents strongly agreed that social media had increased their willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine  In addition  employees reported  21 8   or strongly agreed  28   that the quantity and quality of information on social media has a detrimental impact on their psychological well-being  Additionally  participants also agreed  21 8   or strongly agreed  28   that social media had a negative effect on their psychological condition  Conclusion  The study provides that there was a high degree of awareness indicated among Aseer population regarding misleading information about COVID-19 vaccination via social media  Thus  social media that can share up-to-date scientific information about vaccination must be utilized optimally by the government to assist people in making decisions about accepting vaccinations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876809
993,BACKGROUND  Wearable devices can diagnose  monitor  and manage neurological disorders such as Parkinson disease  With a growing number of wearable devices  it is no longer a case of whether a wearable device can measure Parkinson disease motor symptoms  but rather which features suit the user  Concurrent with continued device development  it is important to generate insights on the nuanced needs of the user in the modern era of wearable device capabilities  OBJECTIVE  This study aims to understand the views and needs of people with Parkinson disease regarding wearable devices for disease monitoring and management  METHODS  This study used a mixed method parallel design  wherein survey and focus groups were concurrently conducted with people living with Parkinson disease in Munster  Ireland  Surveys and focus group schedules were developed with input from people with Parkinson disease  The survey included questions about technology use  wearable device knowledge  and Likert items about potential device features and capabilities  The focus group participants were purposively sampled for variation in age  all were aged >50 years  and sex  The discussions concerned user priorities  perceived benefits of wearable devices  and preferred features  Simple descriptive statistics represented the survey data  The focus groups analyzed common themes using a qualitative thematic approach  The survey and focus group analyses occurred separately  and results were evaluated using a narrative approach  RESULTS  Overall  32 surveys were completed by individuals with Parkinson disease  Four semistructured focus groups were held with 24 people with Parkinson disease  Overall  the participants were positive about wearable devices and their perceived benefits in the management of symptoms  especially those of motor dexterity  Wearable devices should demonstrate clinical usefulness and be user-friendly and comfortable  Participants tended to see wearable devices mainly in providing data for health care professionals rather than providing feedback for themselves  although this was also important  Barriers to use included poor hand function  average technology confidence  and potential costs  It was felt that wearable device design that considered the user would ensure better compliance and adoption  CONCLUSIONS  Wearable devices that allow remote monitoring and assessment could improve health care access for patients living remotely or are unable to travel  COVID-19 has increased the use of remotely delivered health care  therefore  future integration of technology with health care will be crucial  Wearable device designers should be aware of the variability in Parkinson disease symptoms and the unique needs of users  Special consideration should be given to Parkinson disease-related health barriers and the users  confidence with technology  In this context  a user-centered design approach that includes people with Parkinson disease in the design of technology will likely be rewarded with improved user engagement and the adoption of and compliance with wearable devices  potentially leading to more accurate disease management  including self-management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989693
6647,The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a compelling request for accurate diagnostic tests  The aim of this study was assessing the performance of a real-time RT-qPCR  rt RT-qPCR  assay and of a droplet digital RT-PCR  dd RT-PCR  targeting the nsp14 genome region for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs  A total of 258 nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed with the nsp14 assays and  for comparison  with a reference assay targeting the RdRp and E genes  Conflicting results were further investigated by two additional protocols  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  real-time targeting N1 N2  and a nested RT-PCR for the spike region  Agreement of results was achieved on 226 samples  156 positive and 70 negative   8 samples were positive in the reference assay and in the nsp14 rt RT-qPCR but negative with the dd RT-PCR  and 24 samples provided different combinations of results with the three assays  Sensitivity  specificity and accuracy  95  C I   of the nsp14 assays were  100 0    97 4-100 0   98 7    92 1-100 0   and 99 6    97 5-100 0  for the rt RT-qPCR  92 4    87 4-95 6   100 0    94 2-100 0   and 94 7    91 1-97 0  for the dd RT-PCR  The results of the study support the use of the nsp14 real-time RT-qPCR and ddPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902456
2815,The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus  enhanced by rapid spreads of variants  has caused a major international health crisis  with serious public health and economic consequences  An agent-based model was designed to simulate the evolution of the epidemic in France over 2021 and the first six months of 2022  The study compares the efficiencies of four theoretical vaccination campaigns  over 6  9  12  and 18 months   combined with various non-pharmaceutical interventions  In France  with the emergence of the Alpha variant  without vaccination and despite strict barrier measures  more than 600 000 deaths would be observed  An efficient vaccination campaign  i e   total coverage of the French population  over six months would divide the death toll by 10  A vaccination campaign of 12  instead of 6  months would slightly increase the disease-related mortality   6   but require a 77  increase in ICU bed-days  A campaign over 18 months would increase the disease-related mortality by 17  and require a 244  increase in ICU bed-days  Thus  it seems mandatory to vaccinate the highest possible percentage of the population within 12  or better yet  9 months  The race against the epidemic and virus variants is really a matter of vaccination strategy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960207
9693,INTRODUCTION  Coronavirus Disease 19  Covid-19  is an infectious disease caused by the newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   We have plenty of data about the clinical features of the disease s acute phase  while little is known about the long-term consequences on survivors  EVIDENCE ACQUISITION  We aimed to review systematically emerging evidence about clinical and functional consequences of Covid-19 pneumonia months after hospital discharge  EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS  Current evidence supports the idea that a high proportion of Covid-19 survivors complain of symptoms months after the acute illness phase  being fatigue and reduced tolerance to physical effort the most frequently reported symptom  The strongest association for these symptoms is with the female gender  while disease severity seems less relevant  Respiratory symptoms are associated with a decline in respiratory function and  conversely  seem to be more frequent in those who experienced a more severe acute pneumonia  Current evidence highlighted a persistent motor impairment which is  again  more prevalent among those survivors who experienced a more severe acute phase of the disease  Additionally  the persistence of symptoms is a primary determinant of mental health outcome  with anxiety  depression  sleep disturbances  and post-traumatic stress symptoms being commonly reported in Covid-19 survivors  CONCLUSIONS  Current literature highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to Coronavirus Disease 19 since the sequelae appear to involve different organs and systems  Given the pandemic outbreak s size  this is a critical public health issue  a better insight on this topic should inform clinical decisions about the modalities of follow-up for Covid-19 survivors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856780
4606,To determine the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  for coronavirus disease on pediatric hospitalizations for infection with respiratory viruses other than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  we analyzed hospital data for 2017-2021  Compared with 2017-2019  age-specific hospitalization rates associated with respiratory viruses greatly decreased in 2020  when NPIs were in place  Also when NPIs were in place  rates of hospitalization decreased among children of all ages for infection with influenza A and B viruses  respiratory syncytial virus  adenovirus  parainfluenza viruses  human metapneumovirus  and rhinovirus enterovirus  Regression models adjusted for age and seasonality indicated that hospitalization rates for acute febrile illness respiratory symptoms of any cause were reduced by 76  and by 85 -99  for hospitalization for infection with these viruses  NPIs in Hong Kong were clearly associated with reduced pediatric hospitalizations for respiratory viruses  implementing NPIs and reopening schools were associated with only a small increase in hospitalizations for rhinovirus enterovirus infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932446
6332,There is evidence of reduced SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in patients with hematological malignancies  We hypothesized that tumor and treatment-related immunosuppression can be depicted in peripheral blood  and that immune profiling prior to vaccination can help predict immunogenicity  We performed a comprehensive immunological characterization of 83 hematological patients before vaccination and measured IgM  IgG  and IgA antibody response to four viral antigens at day  7 after second-dose COVID-19 vaccination using multidimensional and computational flow cytometry  Health care practitioners of similar age were the control group  n   102   Forty-four out of 59 immune cell types were significantly altered in patients  those with monoclonal gammopathies showed greater immunosuppression than patients with B-cell disorders and Hodgkin lymphoma  Immune dysregulation emerged before treatment  peaked while on-therapy  and did not return to normalcy after stopping treatment  We identified an immunotype that was significantly associated with poor antibody response and uncovered that the frequency of neutrophils  classical monocytes  CD4  and CD8 effector memory CD127low T cells  as well as naive CD21  and IgM D  memory B cells  were independently associated with immunogenicity  Thus  we provide novel immune biomarkers to predict COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in hematological patients  which are complementary to treatment-related factors and may help tailoring possible vaccine boosters,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907159
9114,Previous studies have shown that external threats  such as financial crises and natural disasters  might fuel negative attitudes  emotions  and behaviors towards outgroup members  However  it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll  In this study  we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility  The first is the  ultimate scapegoat  outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup  The second is the  context-dependent  outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts  We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted  Results from our study  N   664   conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel  show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association  However  this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup  When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat  exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them  Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and  as such  are valuable to scholars  practitioners  and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866714

3369,Toll-like receptors  TLR  are crucial components in the initiation of innate immune responses to a variety of pathogens  triggering the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and II interferons  which are responsible for innate antiviral responses  Among the different TLRs  TLR7 recognizes several single-stranded RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2  We and others identified rare loss-of-function variants in X-chromosomal TLR7 in young men with severe COVID-19 and with no prior history of major chronic diseases  that were associated with impaired TLR7 signaling as well as type I and II IFN responses  Here  we performed RNA sequencing to investigate transcriptome variations following imiquimod stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients carrying previously identified hypomorphic  hypofunctional  and loss-of-function TLR7 variants  Our investigation revealed a profound impairment of the TLR7 pathway in patients carrying loss-of-function variants  Of note  a failure in IFNgamma upregulation following stimulation was also observed in cells harboring the hypofunctional and hypomorphic variants  We also identified new TLR7 variants in severely affected male patients for which a functional characterization of the TLR7 pathway was performed demonstrating a decrease in mRNA levels in the IFNalpha  IFNgamma  RSAD2  ACOD1  IFIT2  and CXCL10 genes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952932
5940,INTRODUCTION  While there has been considerable analysis of the health and economic effects of COVID-19 in the Global North  representative data on the distribution and depth of social and economic impacts in Africa has been more limited  METHODS  We analyze household data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and during the first wave of COVID in four African countries  We evaluate the short-term changes to household economic status and assess women s access to health care during the first wave of COVID-19 in nationally representative samples of women aged 15-49 in Kenya and Burkina Faso  and in sub-nationally representative samples of women aged 15-49 in Kinshasa  Democratic Republic of Congo and Lagos  Nigeria  We examine prevalence and distribution of household income loss  food insecurity  and access to health care during the COVID-19 lockdowns across residence and pre-pandemic wealth categories  We then regress pre-pandemic individual and household sociodemographic characteristics on the three outcomes  RESULTS  In three out of four samples  over 90  of women reported partial or complete loss of household income since the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions  Prevalence of food insecurity ranged from 17 0   95  CI 13 6-20 9  to 39 8   95  CI 36 0-43 7   and the majority of women in food insecure households reported increases in food insecurity during the COVID-19 restriction period  In contrast  we did not find significant barriers to accessing health care during COVID restrictions  Between 78 3  and 94 0  of women who needed health care were able successfully access it  When we examined pre-pandemic sociodemographic correlates of the outcomes  we found that the income shock of COVID-19 was substantial and distributed similarly across wealth groups  but food insecurity was concentrated among poorer households  Contrary to a-priori expectations  we find little evidence of women experiencing barriers to health care  but there is significant need for food support,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910752
2417,Globally  the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented clinical and public health concerns with increasing morbidity and mortality  Unfortunately  the burden of COVID-19 in Africa has been further exacerbated by the simultaneous epidemics of Ebola virus disease  EVD  and Lassa Fever  LF  which has created a huge burden on African healthcare systems  As Africa struggles to contain the spread of the second  and third  waves of the COVID-19 pandemic  the number of reported cases of LF is also increasing  and recently  new outbreaks of EVD  Before the pandemic  many of Africa s frail healthcare systems were already overburdened due to resource limitations in staffing and infrastructure  and also  multiple endemic tropical diseases  However  the shared epidemiological and pathophysiological features of COVID-19  EVD and LF as well their simultaneous occurrence in Africa may result in misdiagnosis at the onset of infection  an increased possibility of co-infection  and rapid and silent community spread of the virus es   Other challenges include high population mobility across porous borders  risk of human-to-animal transmission and reverse zoonotic spread  and other public health concerns  This review highlights some major clinical and public health challenges toward responses to the COVID-19 pandemic amidst the deuce-ace of recurrent LF and EVD epidemics in Africa  Applying the One Health approach in infectious disease surveillance and preparedness is essential in mitigating emerging and re-emerging  co- epidemics in Africa and beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965891
4829,BACKGROUND  Among the many collaterals of the COVID-19 pandemic is the disruption of health services and vital clinical research  COVID-19 has magnified the challenges faced in research and threatens to slow research for urgently needed therapeutics for Neglected Tropical Diseases  NTDs  and diseases affecting the most vulnerable populations  Here we explore the impact of the pandemic on a clinical trial for plague therapeutics and strategies that have been considered to ensure research efforts continue  METHODS  To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the trial accrual rate  we documented changes in patterns of all-cause consultations that took place before and during the pandemic at health centres in two districts of the Amoron I Mania region of Madagascar where the trial is underway  We also considered trends in plague reporting and other external factors that may have contributed to slow recruitment  RESULTS  During the pandemic  we found a 27  decrease in consultations at the referral hospital  compared to an 11  increase at peripheral health centres  as well as an overall drop during the months of lockdown  We also found a nation-wide trend towards reduced number of reported plague cases  DISCUSSION  COVID-19 outbreaks are unlikely to dissipate in the near future  Declining NTD case numbers recorded during the pandemic period should not be viewed in isolation or taken as a marker of things to come  It is vitally important that researchers are prepared for a rebound in cases and  most importantly  that research continues to avoid NTDs becoming even more neglected,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928955
367,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  a large number of office workers were required to conduct their work from home  Little is known about the indoor environmental quality  IEQ  preferences and psychosocial comfort preferences of staff working from home  Therefore this study aimed to cluster office workers working at home based on their self-reported preferences for IEQ and psychosocial comfort at their most used workspace and to identify these preferences and needs of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic  A questionnaire was administered to employees of ten offices in the Netherlands  and the 502 respondents were clustered with two models by using TwoStep cluster analysis  The first model was based on variables related to IEQ preferences  while the second was to psychosocial comfort preferences  The analysis revealed four IEQ clusters and six psychosocial comfort clusters  Comparison of these results with other similar studies proposed that the prevalence of anxiety  depression  migraine  and rhinitis  increased for this population during the work-from-home period of the pandemic  Further results suggest that both IEQ and psychosocial comfort preferences are situation- and gender-dependent,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002047
1877,The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented in its scale and speed  impacting the entire world  and having an impact on metropolitan transportation systems  New York City  NYC  was especially hard hit in March and April 2020  A mandatory stay-at-home order was instituted  with all but essential businesses ordered closed  In this paper we examine the impact on the Citi Bike system and the NYC subway  Usage patterns during the lockdown are compared to corresponding days in 2019  Controlling for weather patterns we examine the effect of the lockdown and subsequent reopening of economic activity up through the end of September 2020  The results show that both subway ridership and bikeshare usage plummeted initially  bikeshare usage has nearly returned to normal while subway ridership remains substantially below pre-COVID levels  Implications for policy suggest that the bikeshare system provides resilience to the overall transportation system during disasters when public transit is considered dangerous or is disrupted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975237
9013,The present study investigated a conceptual model by testing flow experience and subjective well-being of university students during Coronavirus Diseas-19  COVID-19  via considering their underlying mechanisms of academic self-efficacy and self-esteem  A total of 1 109 Chinese university students completed a questionnaire containing scales of subjective well-being  flow  academic self-efficacy  and self-esteem  Results yielded from the structural equation modeling analysis indicated a significant and positive association between flow experience and subjective well-being  and such an association was sequentially mediated by academic self-efficacy and self-esteem  Findings also provided empirical evidence for the proposed model highlighting the significant role of flow experience at the higher educational context in predicting subjective well-being of Chinese university students  and how such a relation can be supported by suggested mediating roles academic self-efficacy and self-esteem played,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867624
2571,BACKGROUND  Nascent evidence indicates that the mental health of parents and children has markedly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic  Considering disruptions to traditional face-to-face mental health services resultant from stay-at-home orders  the potential value of digital mental health interventions has become extremely apparent  Despite this  uptake of digital interventions remains poor  indicating that a better understanding is needed of factors that determine a willingness to use digital platforms  METHOD  The present multi-wave  longitudinal study of 2365 Australian parents explored between-person and within-person predictors of intentions to use digital interventions during the pandemic  RESULTS  More than one-third of parents reported likely use of a self-guided and therapist-guided digital intervention  with the most endorsed reason for use being to support their child s mental health  Between-person baseline predictors of higher intention ratings were parent s prior mental illness  not living with a partner and recent environmental stressors  Within-person predictors of higher intention ratings were endorsement of mindful parenting strategies  child access to the Internet  better perceived management of child s education  lower social support and financial hardship  CONCLUSION  Findings demonstrate that willingness to engage in digital interventions fluctuates in response to changing circumstances  Identifying novel ways to increase acceptance and uptake of digital interventions based on modifiable predictors established here is needed to realize the full potential of these modes of care in times of need,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963330

6522,Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  had already spread worldwide  and healthcare services have become limited in many countries  Efficient screening of hospitalized individuals is vital in the struggle toward COVID-19 through chest radiography  which is one of the important assessment strategies  This allows researchers to understand medical information in terms of chest X-ray  CXR  images and evaluate relevant irregularities  which may result in a fully automated identification of the disease  Due to the rapid growth of cases every day  a relatively small number of COVID-19 testing kits are readily accessible in health care facilities  Thus it is imperative to define a fully automated detection method as an instant alternate treatment possibility to limit the occurrence of COVID-19 among individuals  In this paper  a two-step Deep learning  DL  architecture has been proposed for COVID-19 diagnosis using CXR  The proposed DL architecture consists of two stages   feature extraction and classification   The  Multi-Objective Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm  MOGOA   is presented to optimize the DL network layers  hence  these networks have named as  Multi-COVID-Net   This model classifies the Non-COVID-19  COVID-19  and pneumonia patient images automatically  The Multi-COVID-Net has been tested by utilizing the publicly available datasets  and this model provides the best performance results than other state-of-the-art methods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903956
1438,Presently  the world needs safe and effective vaccines to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic  Our work has focused on formulating two types of mRNA vaccines that differ in capacity to copy themselves inside the cell  These are non-amplifying mRNA  NRM  and self-amplifying mRNA  SAM  vaccines  Both the vaccine candidates encode an engineered viral replicon which can provoke an immune response  Hence we predicted and screened twelve epitopes from the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2  We used five CTL  four HTL  and three B-cell-activating epitopes to formulate each mRNA vaccine  Molecular docking revealed that these epitopes could combine with HLA molecules that are important for boosting immunogenicity  The B-cell epitopes were adjoined with GPGPG linkers  while CTL and HTL epitopes were linked with KK linkers  The entire protein chain was reverse translated to develop a specific NRM-based vaccine  We incorporate gene encoding replicase in the upstream region of CDS encoding antigen to design the SAM vaccine  Subsequently  signal sequences were added to human mRNA to formulate vaccines  Both vaccine formulations translated to produce the epitopes in host cells  initiate a protective immune cascade  and generate immunogenic memory  which can counter future SARS-CoV-2 viral exposures before the onset of infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981440

1053,Human corneal endothelium  HCE  is a single layer of hexagonal cells that lines the posterior surface of the cornea  It forms the barrier that separates the aqueous humor from the rest of the corneal layers  stroma and epithelium layer   This layer plays a fundamental role in maintaining the hydration and transparency of the cornea  which in turn ensures a clear vision  In vivo  human corneal endothelial cells  HCECs  are generally believed to be nonproliferating  In many cases  due to their nonproliferative nature  any damage to these cells can lead to further issues with Descemet s membrane  DM   stroma and epithelium which may ultimately lead to hazy vision and blindness  Endothelial keratoplasties such as Descemet s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty  DSAEK  and Descemet s membrane endothelial keratoplasty  DEK  are the standard surgeries routinely used to restore vision following endothelial failure  Basically  these two similar surgical techniques involve the replacement of the diseased endothelial layer in the center of the cornea by a healthy layer taken from a donor cornea  Globally  eye banks are facing an increased demand to provide corneas that have suitable features for transplantation  Consequently  it can be stated that there is a significant shortage of corneal grafting tissue  for every 70 corneas required  only 1 is available  Nowadays  eye banks face long waiting lists due to shortage of donors  seriously aggravated when compared with previous years  due to the global COVID-19 pandemic  Thus  there is an urgent need to find alternative and more sustainable sources for treating endothelial diseases  such as utilizing bioengineering to use of biomaterials as a remedy  The current review focuses on the use of biomaterials to repair the corneal endothelium  A range of biomaterials have been considered based on their promising results and outstanding features  including previous studies and their key findings in the context of each biomaterial,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988369
1210,Some infectious diseases  including COVID-19  can undergo airborne transmission  This may happen at close proximity  but as time indoors increases  infections can occur in shared room air despite distancing  We propose two indicators of infection risk for this situation  that is  relative risk parameter  Hr  and risk parameter  H   They combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission indoors  virus-containing aerosol generation rate  breathing flow rate  masking and its quality  ventilation and aerosol-removal rates  number of occupants  and duration of exposure  COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend that is consistent with airborne infection and enable recommendations to minimize transmission risk  Transmission in typical prepandemic indoor spaces is highly sensitive to mitigation efforts  Previous outbreaks of measles  influenza  and tuberculosis were also assessed  Measles outbreaks occur at much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19  while tuberculosis outbreaks are observed at higher risk parameter values  Because both diseases are accepted as airborne  the fact that COVID-19 is less contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission  It is important that future outbreak reports include information on masking  ventilation and aerosol-removal rates  number of occupants  and duration of exposure  to investigate airborne transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985868

3798,OBJECTIVE  In the last year  a large amount of research has investigated the anti-spike protein receptor-binding domain  S-RBD  antibody responses in patients at high risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome because of COVID-19 infection  However  no data are available on the chronic disorder of consciousness  DOC   METHODS  Here  we evaluated anti-S-RBD IgG levels after vaccination in chronic DOC patients compared with demographically matched healthy controls  HC  by indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay  All individuals completed a two-dose-cycle vaccination with Pfizer mRNA vaccine  BNT162b2   and antibody responses were evaluated at 30 and 180 days after the administration of the second dose of vaccination  RESULTS  We compared 32 DOC patients with 34 demographically matched healthy controls  Both DOC and HC groups showed a similar antibody response at 30 days  whereas at follow-up  180 days  DOC patients were characterized by lower S-RBD IgG levels with respect to controls  Additional multiple regression analyses including demographical and clinical comorbidities as predictors revealed that age was the only factor associated with the decrease in S-RBD IgG levels at follow-up  180 days   Elderly individuals of both groups were characterized by a reduction in the antibody responses with respect to younger individuals  CONCLUSIONS  Our results show an efficacy seroconversion in DOC patients in the first period after vaccination  which significantly declines over time with respect to healthy controls,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945125
8013,Regulatory T  Treg  cells  which constitute about 5-10  of CD4 T cells expressing Foxp3 transcription factor and CD25 IL-2 receptor alpha chain   are key regulators in controlling immunological self-tolerance and various immune responses  However  how Treg cells control antigen-specific immunity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  remains unclear  In this study  we examined the effect of transient breakdown of the immunological tolerance induced by Treg-cell depletion on adaptive immune responses against administered SARS-CoV-2 antigen  spike protein 1  S1   Notably  without the use of adjuvants  transient Treg-cell depletion in mice induced anti-S1 antibodies that neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2  follicular helper T cell formation and S1-binding germinal center B cell responses  but prevented the onset of developing autoimmune diseases  To further clarify the mechanisms  we investigated maturation of dendritic cells  DCs   which is essential to initiate antigen-specific immunity  We found that the transient Treg-cell depletion resulted in maturation of both migratory and resident DCs in draining lymph nodes that captured S1-antigen  Moreover  we observed S1-specific CD4  T cells and CD8  T cells with interferon-gamma production  Thus  captured S1 was successfully presented by DCs  including cross-presentation to CD8  T cells  These data indicate that transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants induces maturation of antigen-presenting DCs and succeeds in generating antigen-specific humoral and cellular immunity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 antigens  Finally  we showed that SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific immune responses induced by transient Treg-cell depletion in the absence of adjuvants were compatible with those induced with an effective adjuvant  polyriboinosinic polyribocytidyl acid  poly IC  and that the combination of transient Treg-cell depletion with poly IC induced potent responses  These findings highlight the capacity for manipulating Treg cells to induce protective adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with activating antigen-presenting DCs  which may improve the efficacy of ongoing vaccine therapies and help enhance responses to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882757

39,BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -induced pneumonia is a disease with high mortality and  still  no effective treatment  Excessively elevated C-reactive protein  CRP  plasma levels inversely correlate with prognosis  As CRP  via complement and macrophage activation  can cause organ damage in COVID-19  we have recently introduced selective CRP apheresis as a potentially effective treatment  Now  we report on the first patients with severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia treated within the  C-reactive protein Apheresis in COVID   CACOV  registry  CASE REPORT Seven sequential hospitalized patients with documented COVID-19  strongly elevated CRP plasma levels  and respiratory failure were treated by selective CRP apheresis in addition to standard therapy after having given their informed consent for inclusion in the CACOV registry  We performed 2-8 CRP apheresis sessions via either peripheral or central venous access depending on clinical course and CRP plasma levels  CRP apheresis  in COVID-19  reduced CRP plasma levels by approximately 50-90   and it was thus highly effective  feasible  and safe  Despite severe radiological lung involvement in all our patients  only 2 patients finally required intubation  and none required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO   All 7 patients were discharged from our 2 hospitals in good clinical condition  CONCLUSIONS Selective CRP apheresis  starting early after patient admission  may be an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia  SARS-COV-2 can cause organ damage and multiple organ failure predominantly by an excessive CRP-mediated autoimmune response of the ancient innate immune system  Further registry data and randomized trials are needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007274
4092,OBJECTIVE  To determine whether surge conditions were associated with increased mortality  DESIGN  Multicenter cohort study  SETTING  U S  ICUs participating in STOP-COVID  PATIENTS  Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to participating ICUs between March 4 and July 1  2020  INTERVENTIONS  None  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS  The main outcome was 28-day in-hospital mortality  To assess the association between admission to an ICU during a surge period and mortality  we used two different strategies   1  an inverse probability weighted difference-in-differences model limited to appropriately matched surge and non-surge patients and  2  a meta-regression of 50 multivariable difference-in-differences models  each based on sets of randomly matched surge- and non-surge hospitals   In the first analysis  we considered a single surge period for the cohort  March 23 - May 6   In the second  each surge hospital had its own surge period  which was compared to the same time periods in matched non-surge hospitals  Our cohort consisted of 4342 ICU patients  average age 60 8  sd 14 8   63 5  men  in 53 U S  hospitals  Of these  13 hospitals encountered surge conditions  In analysis 1  the increase in mortality seen during surge was not statistically significant  odds ratio  95  CI   1 30  0 47-3 58   p    6   In analysis 2  surge was associated with an increased odds of death  odds ratio 1 39  95  CI  1 34-1 43   p <  001   CONCLUSIONS  Admission to an ICU with COVID-19 in a hospital that is experiencing surge conditions may be associated with an increased odds of death  Given the high incidence of COVID-19  such increases would translate into substantial excess mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939474
1858,Background  As the majority of studies examining mental health during the pandemic are cross-sectional  little is known about the changes in mental health during the pandemic  especially in university students  Most studies indicate a worsening of mental health conditions  This study aimed to evaluate the mental health status of German university students during the third wave of the pandemic in 2021 and to compare the results to a sample of a congruent cross-sectional study from 2020  Methods  Two cross-sectional and anonymous online surveys among university students were conducted  first survey  July-August 2020  N   3 382  second survey  March-April 2021  N   5 642   Mental health status was assessed with standardized measures  depressive symptoms  alcohol and drug consumption  and eating disorder symptoms   and social and emotional aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed  In addition to descriptive statistics and group comparisons of the two survey samples from 2020 and 2021  respectively  risk and protective factors related to mental health were analyzed  Results  There were significant differences in severities of depressive symptoms and alcohol and drug consumption between the two online surveys from 2020 and 2021  Findings suggest an increase in the severity of depressive symptoms as well as alcohol and drug consumption  Significantly more respondents reported suicidal ideation in the survey from 2021  Lower self-efficacy  less social support and lower resilience as well as higher perceived stress and more loneliness were reported by the participants of the survey from 2021 compared to 2020  Regarding factors predicting mental health symptoms  being female was a positive predictor for hazardous alcohol use and anorexia nervosa in comparison to men  Further  younger age  being diverse  higher perceived stress and loneliness were positive predictors for all mental health outcomes  Conclusion  This study reveals an increase in severities of depressive symptoms  including suicidal ideation  drug and alcohol consumption among students  Being diverse  younger age  higher perceived stress and loneliness were mutual risk factors for higher depressive and eating disorder symptoms as well as alcohol consumption  Universities and health care policy should recognize and address mental health issues of young adults during ongoing times of crisis and invest in easy-to-access interventions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975589
3898,It recently has been found that methods of the statistical theories of spectra can be a useful tool in the analysis of spectra far from levels of Hamiltonian systems  The purpose of the present study is to deepen this kind of approach by performing a more comprehensive spectral analysis that measures both the local- and long-range statistics  We have found that  as a common feature  spectra of this kind can exhibit a situation in which local statistics are relatively quenched while the long-range ones show large fluctuations  By combining three extensions of the standard random matrix theory  RMT  and considering long spectra  we demonstrate that this phenomenon occurs when disorder and level incompleteness are introduced in an RMT spectrum  Consequently  the long-range statistics follow Taylor s law  suggesting the presence of a fluctuation scaling  FS  mechanism in this kind of spectra  Applications of the combined ensemble are then presented for spectra originate from several very diverse areas  including complex networks  COVID-19 time series  and quantitative linguistics  which demonstrate that short- and long-range statistics reflect the rigid and elastic characteristics of a given spectrum  respectively  These observations may shed some light on spectral data classification,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942699
5474,Introduction  The year 2020 began with the world being flounced with a wave of novel coronavirus  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   disease  named COVID-19  Based on promising pre-clinical and clinical data  remdesivir  RDV  was the first drug to receive FDA approval and so far  it is the most common therapy for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 MERS-CoV  However  following intravenous administration  RDV metabolizes majorly by human liver carboxylesterase 1  CES1  and marginally by the CYP3A4 enzyme in merely less than an hour  Its resultant active metabolite is a hydrophilic nucleoside with very limited accumulation within lung tissues  Therefore  there is a need to investigate strategies to overcome such premature metabolism issues and improve the antiviral efficacy of RDV at the target site  Objective  Considering the major CES1-mediated metabolism of RDV on systemic administration  we intend to explore the remarkable CES1 plus CYP3A4 inhibitory activity of cannabidiol  CBD  against in vitro microsomal metabolism of RDV to indicate its therapeutic potential as an adjuvant to RDV in the treatment and management of COVID-19  Methods  We investigated the in vitro human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV in the presence of two potential CES1 inhibitors-CBD and nelfinavir  and two standard CYP3A4 inhibitors-ritonavir  RITO  and cyclosporin A  The microsomal metabolism assay was further validated by using a well-characterized CYP3A4-selective substrate  midazolam  MDZ   in the presence of CBD and RITO  Results  Our findings depicted that RDV was rapidly and completely metabolized by human liver microsomes within 60 min  Coincubation with CBD substantially reduced microsomal metabolism of RDV and prolonged its in vitro half-life from 8 93 to 31 07 min  CBD showed significantly higher inhibition of RDV compared with known CES1 and CYP3A4 inhibitors  Inhibition of MDZ metabolism by CBD and RITO further validated the assay  Conclusions  The current study strongly suggests that CBD significantly inhibits human liver microsomal metabolism of RDV and extends its in vitro half-life  Thus  concomitant administration of CBD with RDV intravenous injection could be a promising strategy to prevent premature metabolism in COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918945
2109,RATIONALE  Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  many hospitals have reduced in-hospital visitation  In these situations  virtual communication tools have helped maintain interaction between parties  The Frontline Connect program was designed to address communication and patient care challenges by providing data-enabled devices to clinical staff in hospitals  OBJECTIVE  This study aimed to identify areas of improvement for the Frontline Connect program by   a  evaluating communication needs  user experience  and program satisfaction  and  b  identifying potential barriers to device access or use  METHODS  We administered pre-implementation needs assessment  post-use  and exit surveys to healthcare staff at a pilot hospital site in Ontario  Recruitment was through email lists and site champions using convenience sampling  We descriptively analysed survey responses and compared the initial need statements to post-implementation use-cases identified by users  RESULTS  We received 139 needs assessments  31 user experience assessments  and 47 exit survey responses  Most device use occurred in the emergency department and intensive care units and was facilitated by social workers  nurses  and physicians to connect patients  families  and care providers  Pre-implementation concerns were related to infection control  data security  and device privacy  In the exit survey  these were replaced by other concerns including Internet connectivity and time-intensiveness  Device utility and ease-of-use were rated 9 7 10 and 9 6 10 respectively in the user experience survey  though overall experience was rated 7 2 10 in the exit survey  Overall  respondents viewed the devices as useful and we agree with participants who suggested increased program promotion and training would likely improve adoption  CONCLUSIONS  We found that our virtual technology program for facilitating communication was positively perceived  Survey feedback indicates that a rapid rollout in response to urgent pandemic-related needs was feasible  though program logistics could be improved  The current work supports the need to improve  standardize  and sustain virtual communication programs in hospitals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970832
2362,Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is associated with several known signs and symptoms  including olfactory disturbances leading to anosmia and parosmia  This study aimed to evaluate the clinical features of the emerging symptoms of post-COVID-19 parosmia and to report the outcome of commonly used intervention methods  Methods The study s sample included post-COVID-19 patients who complained of parosmia  presented to otorhinolaryngology clinics at private tertiary care hospitals from December 2020 to April 2021  Patients  data were collected from the hospital system and through direct phone interviews  The Modified Arabic 20-Items Sino-Nasal Outcome Test  MA-SNOT-20  was used to measure the severity of rhinosinusitis symptoms  Results Twenty-one patients were included in the study  and their ages mainly ranged between 20 and 39 years  76 2    predominantly females 19  90 5    Post the COVID-19 illness course  nearly half of the patients  9  42 9   reported full recovery of olfaction and taste senses  Nine cases  42 9   received treatment with intranasal and oral steroids  of which only three cases  14 3   noticed improvement  The remaining 12 cases  57 1   did not receive any treatment  two of which improved  9 5    The maximum MA-SNOT score was 37 while the minimum was 3  and eight patients  38 1   scores were between one and 10 points  Conclusion Olfactory and taste dysfunctions are common symptoms of COVID-19  The emerging symptom of parosmia is worth reporting in the literature to increase the awareness of this particular symptom in this pandemic era  Many management strategies have been introduced that might be effective  However  further studies are needed to establish evidence-based management protocols,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966613
4076,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the psychological state of healthcare workers  HCWs  in the field of rehabilitation during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  Cross-sectional observational study  Sample of 334 HCWs including  nurses  medical doctors  therapists  scientists  and clerical workers working at the IRCCS San Raffaele Roma rehabilitation hospital during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  Anonymous web-based questionnaire included 14-item Resilience Scale  Brief-COPE  Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale  Fear of COVID-19 Scale  Occupational and sociodemographic characteristics  RESULTS  High levels of resilience  low levels of anxiety  depression  and fear were observed in the study population  the most frequently used coping strategies in the Brief-COPE were acceptance  planning  and active coping  Specifically  87  of the participants reported a moderate to high level of resilience  with the highest level observed in nurses while physicians show the lowest level  HCWs showed symptoms of anxiety  29    depressive symptoms  10    and fear caused by the COVID-19 pandemic  44    Statistically significant differences were observed between different occupations for fear  p <0 05  and resilience  p <0 01   Levels of anxiety and fear appeared to be higher in female and younger workers  The latter group - who also reported higher levels of depression - showed lower levels of resilience  CONCLUSIONS  In our study hospital and non-hospital workers show different emotional  cognitive  and behavioural resources when facing stressful situations  like in the case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics  Our results support the role of resilience and the proper use of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies as protective factors from psychological distress,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939618

107,Introduction  The Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research conducts post-market surveillance of biologic products to ensure their safety and effectiveness  Studies have found that common vaccine exposures may be missing from structured data elements of electronic health records  EHRs   instead being captured in clinical notes  This impacts monitoring of adverse events following immunizations  AEFIs   For example  COVID-19 vaccines have been regularly administered outside of traditional medical settings  We developed a natural language processing  NLP  algorithm to mine unstructured clinical notes for vaccinations not captured in structured EHR data  Methods  A random sample of 1 000 influenza vaccine administrations  representing 995 unique patients  was extracted from a large U S  EHR database  NLP techniques were used to detect administrations from the clinical notes in the training dataset  80   N   797  of patients   The algorithm was applied to the validation dataset  20   N   198  of patients  to assess performance  Full medical charts for 28 randomly selected administration events in the validation dataset were reviewed by clinicians  The NLP algorithm was then applied across the entire dataset  N   995  to quantify the number of additional events identified  Results  A total of 3 199 administrations were identified in the structured data and clinical notes combined  Of these  2 740  85 7   were identified in the structured data  while the NLP algorithm identified 1 183  37 0   administrations in clinical notes  459 were not also captured in the structured data  This represents a 16 8  increase in the identification of vaccine administrations compared to using structured data alone  The validation of 28 vaccine administrations confirmed 27  96 4   as  definite  vaccine administrations  18  64 3   had evidence of a vaccination event in the structured data  while 10  35 7   were found solely in the unstructured notes  Discussion  We demonstrated the utility of an NLP algorithm to identify vaccine administrations not captured in structured EHR data  NLP techniques have the potential to improve detection of vaccine administrations not otherwise reported without increasing the analysis burden on physicians or practitioners  Future applications could include refining estimates of vaccine coverage and detecting other exposures  population characteristics  and outcomes not reliably captured in structured EHR data,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005697
5076,Early detection of asymptomatic cases through mass screening is essential to constrain the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  transmission  However  the existing diagnostic strategies are either resource-intensive  time-consuming  or less sensitive  which limits their use in the development of rapid mass screening strategies  There is a clear pressing need for simple  fast  sensitive  and economical diagnostic strategy for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  screening even in resource-limited settings  In the current work  we assessed the in silico feasibility of directly labeling virus surface proteins using fluorogenic molecules with aggregation-induced emission  AIE  property  Here  we present the results for binding of two such AIE probes  phosphonic acid derivative of tetraphenyl ethylene  TPE-P  and sulfonic acid derivative of tetraphenyl ethylene  TPE-S   to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein based on in silico docking studies  Our results show that both TPE-P and TPE-S bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2 -binding  and N-terminal domains of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  Molecular dynamic simulations have revealed specific nature of these interactions  We also show that TPE-P and TPE-S bind to hemagglutinin protein of influenza virus  but the interaction strength was found to be different  This difference in interaction strength may affect the emission spectrum of aforementioned AIE probes  Together  these results form a basis for the development of AIE-based diagnostics for differential detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses  We believe that these in silico predictions certainly aid in differentially labeling of the both viruses toward the development of rapid detection by AIE probes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925274

8478,Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying degrees of success  Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age  while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups  Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others  Motivated by this  we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions  Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed  SEIR  model  we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently  Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices  which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted  This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios  which could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression strategies  Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies  We demonstrate how Irish lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant  what if   instead of  lockdown counterfactuals  Uncertainty quantification for the predictive approaches is described  Our formulation is agnostic to a specific locale  in that lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded using this model,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874981

5532,Background  Vaccination has been recognized as a vital step for containing the COVID-19 outbreak  To ensure the success of immunization efforts as a public health containment measure  a high level of public vaccination compliance is essential  Targeted educational programs can be utilized to improve attitudes toward vaccination and improve the public s uptake of protective measures  Methods  In this cross-sectional study  we aimed to evaluate the impact of a concise educational program on perceived knowledge regarding the COVID-19 vaccine  vaccine importance and trust  protection and fear from COVID-19  trust in authorities  as well as individual resilience  Results  The study evaluated 503 participants that completed the questionnaire before and after viewing a concise video tutorial on vaccination  Following the educational program  scores of five variables increased significantly compared to their pre-viewing level  knowledge  personal resilience  trust in authorities  vaccine importance  as well as perceived protection  Those that were vaccinated and or intend to be vaccinated  N   394  report higher levels of knowledge  trust in authorities  vaccine importance  vaccine trust  and fear of being infected as compared to those that are unwilling to get vaccinated  Positive significant correlations were found between resilience and trust in authorities  r   0 169  p < 0 001   vaccine importance  r   0 098  p   0 028   and feeling protected  r   0 310  p < 0 001   Trust in authorities was positively correlated with vaccine importance  r   0 589  p < 0 001  and vaccine trust  r   0 177  p < 0 001   Vaccine importance was positively correlated with vaccine trust  r   0 149  p   0 001   but not correlated with knowledge score  Conclusion  The findings of the study demonstrate the benefits of educational programs on improving attitudes toward vaccination acceptability  Incorporation of such concise educational programs by authorities may improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and help overcome public vaccine hesitancy  We recommend that such a concise and easily implementable educational program be incorporated as a response component to the current and future outbreaks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917578
408,The present work studies the epidemic curve of COVID-19 in Italy between September 2020 and mid-June 2021 in terms of poussees  that is successive waves  There is obviously only one pandemic  although the virus has spread in the form of several variants  but the daily incidence trend can also be read in terms of overlapping of events that are different from each other or  in any case  induced by various phenomena  It can be hypothesized that in this way a succession of various waves was generated  which are modelled here using appropriate adaptation curves used in the study of epidemic data  Each curve corresponds approximately to the situation that would have occurred if no element had intervened to prevent the decrease of infections after the relative peak  while their overlap is considered to describe the subsequent increases  This interpolation has no predictive purpose  being purely descriptive over the time window under consideration  The discrepancies between the superposition of the modelling curves and the real epidemic curve are therefore also highlighted  especially in the transition periods between the various poussees  Finally  the analysis carried out allows to match the trend of the epidemic in the period considered with  on one hand  the series of events and  on the other  with the containment measures adopted which may have determined the succession of increases and decreases in the incidence of infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001600
1583,Conspiratorial belief is a type of argument that accepts implausible explanations in situations of great uncertainty or mystery  Claiming that the coronavirus is an artificial fabrication of laboratories is an example of conspiracist belief  The aim of this research was to analyze the impact of conspiracist ideation and psychotic-like experiences in patients with schizophrenia  patients with other mental disorders  and participants with no psychiatric history with a 132-day follow-up during the COVID-19 crisis  Analysis of variance  ANOVA  was applied and Bayesian inferences were carried out  The results conclude that conspiracist ideation and psychotic-like experiences increased significantly after 132 days of social-health restrictions in the general population  However  psychotic-like experiences did not increase in patients with schizophrenia  Conspiracist ideation has a quantitative degradation similar to the continuum model of psychosis  it is present both in patients with schizophrenia and in those participants with no clinical history  The psychopathological value of conspiracist ideation within the spectrum of psychosis is discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979358

2614,Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms are rare in childhood and typically are seen in the setting of connective tissue defect syndromes  These aneurysms may lead to rupture  dissection  or valvular insufficiency  so root replacement is recommended  Here  we present a 17-month-old girl who presented with fever  cough  and pericardial effusion  Initially  we suspected this could be a COVID-19 case  so a nasopharyngeal swap was performed  An ascending aorta aneurysm involving the aortic arch was confirmed by echo  and urgent ascending aorta and arch replacement were done by utilizing the descending aorta as a new arch  The final diagnosis came with cutis laxa syndrome  In similar cases  good outcomes can be achieved with accurate diagnosis and appropriate surgical management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962481
8747,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of maternal death  intensive care unit admission  and preterm birth  however  many people who are pregnant refuse to receive COVID-19 vaccination because of a lack of safety data  OBJECTIVE  The objective of this preliminary study was to assess whether Twitter data could be used to identify a cohort for epidemiologic studies of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy  Specifically  we examined whether it is possible to identify users who have reported  1  that they received COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period  and  2  their pregnancy outcomes  METHODS  We developed regular expressions to search for reports of COVID-19 vaccination in a large collection of tweets posted through the beginning of July 2021 by users who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter  To help determine if users were vaccinated during pregnancy  we drew upon a natural language processing  NLP  tool that estimates the timeframe of the prenatal period  For users who posted tweets with a timestamp indicating they were vaccinated during pregnancy  we drew upon additional NLP tools to help identify tweets that reported their pregnancy outcomes  RESULTS  We manually verified the content of tweets detected automatically  identifying 150 users who reported on Twitter that they received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period  We manually verified at least one reported outcome for 45 of the 60  75   completed pregnancies  CONCLUSIONS  Given the limited availability of data on COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy  Twitter can be a complementary resource for potentially increasing the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant populations  The results of this preliminary study justify the development of scalable methods to identify a larger cohort for epidemiologic studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870607
6030,There is a growing concern that ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 could lead to variants of concern  VOC  that are capable of avoiding some or all of the multi-faceted immune response generated by both prior infection or vaccination  with the recently described B 1 1 529  Omicron  VOC being of particular interest  Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed  recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients  n 30  infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8  T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach  This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8  T-cells in these individuals  n 52 distinct epitopes  are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC  n 50 mutations   Within this population  only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2 30  7   individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC  These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8  T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC  and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time  Importance  The newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date  In addition  many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies  suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised  However  both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses  in addition to antibodies  This study examined if the parts of the virus  or epitopes  targeted by the CD8  T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant  Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron  These data suggest that the T-cell immune response in previously infected  and most likely vaccinated individuals  should still be effective against Omicron,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909772
9194,On February 19  2020  the Iranian government officially confirmed the first deaths due to COVID-19 and within a week  all universities were closed  The purpose of this study is to explore Iranian medical students  psychological and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 pandemic  This descriptive phenomenological study was conducted on 52 medical students  Data were collected using a purposive sampling method by means of synchronous virtual focus group discussions which were conducted using the WhatsApp messaging application  Data were analyzed using the MAXQDA software version 2020  Data analysis resulted in the emergence of three categories consisting of psychological responses to the pandemic and the behavioral and psychological responses to the quarantine  Most of the extracted themes are related to students  psychological reactions to the pandemic  During the quarantine period  students suffered from uncertainty  experienced boredom  worried about delay in their graduation  and were concerned about losing employment opportunities  Medical students must be prepared for crisis situations like the present pandemic  We recommend that online courses and training programs be developed with the aim of offsetting the negative effects of university closure on students  education and skill training,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865547
7488,Previous works have shown the efficacy of mechanical stimulation by applying pressure and vibration on muscle rehabilitation  Additionally  a temperature increase can improve both muscle performance and blood circulation during therapies  These modalities of treatment are commonly applied separately in patients with moderate disuse-induced muscle atrophy  In this paper  we propose the design of a novel medical device that synergistically integrates the function of i  elastomeric pneumatic actuators to apply focused orthogonal pressure  ii  vibratory motors to generate localized vibration and iii  carbon fibre heaters for a temperature increase  In particular  computational simulations were performed to characterize the mechanical behaviour of different pneumatic actuator geometries and their predicted advantages in comparison to previous designs  The integration of the three functionalities of the device and preliminary simulations results showcase its potential for improving therapy efficacy  while also being compact  lightweight  and comfortable  which would ease its implementation in rehabilitation programs Clinical relevance- Disuse-induced muscle atrophy and related cardiovascular problems can lead to physical impairment and significantly affect patient independence  The surge in the number of hospitalized and bedridden patients related to the coronavirus disease  COVID-19  brings about a predicted increase in the incidence of myopathies and muscle weakness  To attend the growing demand  technological aids for more efficient physical therapies will need to be developed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891588
613,PURPOSE  In particular after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  there was a precipitous rush to implement virtual and online learning strategies in surgery and medicine  It is essential to understand whether this approach is sufficient and adequate to allow the development of robotic basic surgical skills  The main aim of the authors was to verify if the quality assured eLearning is sufficient to prepare individuals to perform a basic surgical robotic task  METHODS  A prospective  randomized and multi-center study was conducted in September 2020 in the ORSI Academy  International surgical robotic training center  Forty-seven participants  with no experience but a special interest in robotic surgery  were matched and randomized into four groups who underwent a didactic preparation with different formats before carrying out a robotic suturing and anastomosis task  Didactic preparation methods ranged from a complete eLearning path to peer-reviewed published manuscripts describing the suturing  knot tying and task assessment metrics  RESULTS  The primary outcome was the percentage of trainees who demonstrated the quantitatively defined proficiency benchmark after learning to complete an assisted but unaided robotic vesico-urethral anastomosis task  The quantitatively defined benchmark was based on the objectively assessed performance  i e   procedure steps completed  errors and critical errors  of experienced robotic surgeons for a proficiency-based progression  PBP  training course  None of the trainees in this study demonstrated the proficiency benchmarks in completing the robotic surgery task  CONCLUSIONS  PBP-based e-learning methodology is an effective training method avoiding critical errors in the suturing and knotting task  Quality assured online learning is insufficient preparation for robotic suturing and knot tying anastomosis skills  TRIAL REGISTRATION  ClinicalTrials gov Identifier  NCT04541615,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997525

9570,SARS-CoV-2 infects humans and causes Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   The S1 domain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  via its receptor-binding domain  while the S2 domain facilitates fusion between the virus and the host cell membrane for entry  The spike glycoprotein of circulating SARS-CoV-2 genomes is a mutation hotspot  Some mutations may affect the binding affinity for hACE2  while others may modulate S-glycoprotein expression  or they could result in a virus that can escape from antibodies generated by infection with the original variant or by vaccination  Since a large number of variants are emerging  it is of vital importance to be able to rapidly assess their characteristics  while changes of binding affinity alone do not always cause direct advantages for the virus  they still can provide important insights on where the evolutionary pressure is directed  Here  we propose a simple and cost-effective computational protocol based on Molecular Dynamics simulations to rapidly screen the ability of mutated spike protein to bind to the hACE2 receptor and selected neutralizing biomolecules  Our results show that it is possible to achieve rapid and reliable predictions of binding affinities  A similar approach can be used to perform preliminary screenings of the potential effects of S-RBD mutations  helping to prioritize the more time-consuming and expensive experimental work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858396

5529,Background  The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  which targets the pulmonary vasculature is supposed to induce an intrapulmonary right to left shunt with an increased pulmonary blood flow  We report here what may be  to the best of our knowledge  the first videoendoscopic descriptions of an hypervascularization of the bronchial mucosa in two patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pneumonia  Cases Presentation  Two patients  27- and 37-year-old  were addressed to our Pneumology department for suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia  Their symptoms  fever  dry cough  and dyspnoea   associated to pulmonary ground glass opacities on thoracic CT  were highly suggestive of a COVID-19 disease despite repeated negative pharyngeal swabs RT-PCR  In both patients  bronchoscopy examination using white light was unremarkable but NBI bronchoscopy revealed a diffuse hypervascularization of the mucosa from the trachea to the sub-segmental bronchi  associated with dilated submucosal vessels  RT-PCR performed in bronchoalveolar lavage  BAL  confirmed the presence of Sars-CoV-2  Conclusions  These two case reports highlight the crucial importance of the vascular component of the viral disease  We suggest that such bronchial hypervascularization with dilated vessels contributes  at least in part  to the intrapulmonary right to left shunt that characterizes the COVID-19 related Acute Vascular Distress Syndrome  AVDS   The presence of diffuse bronchial hypervascularization in the context of COVID-19 pandemic should prompt the search for Sars-CoV-2 in BAL samples,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917628
5020,Introduction Viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS COV-2  releases cytokines which result in neutrophils migration to the bloodstream and cytotoxic effect on lymphocytes  The ongoing pathology is reflected in the derangement of blood cells and the variations and calculations based on them that help in assessing the severity of the disease and prognosis  Aim This study aimed to compare the differences in the dynamic changes of the blood cells among survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19 disease so that cut-offs can be arrived at to aid triage at the intensive care unit  ICU  and to predict mortality  Material and methods A one-year study was conducted on patients hospitalized in the ICU  The demography and laboratory values of neutrophils and lymphocytes in percentages and absolute values  and platelet count in numbers were retrieved for eight consecutive values  Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  NLR  and platelet to lymphocyte ratio  PLR  was calculated from absolute counts  Statistical analysis was done using the Chi-Square test and Mann-Whitney test and a P-value of <0 05 is considered significant  The comparison was done between survivors and non-survivors  Result Among the 3142 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease  7 6  required ICU care of whom 65 5  survived and 35 5  succumbed to the illness  Survivors were younger and comparable between both sexes  Though both groups had an ascending trend of neutrophils  lymphocytes  NLR  and PLR  the baseline characteristics were significantly lower in those who survived on a day-to-day basis  Neutrophilia above 80   NLR 7 96  PLR 200 predicted the need for admission in ICU  Neutrophilia of 87  and lymphopenia of 10  were associated with adverse outcomes  mortality   Mortality can be predicted when neutrophil rises above 93  or lymphocytes fall below 5 2   An initial NLR of 7 96 and PLR of 160 as well as peak NLR of 12 29 and peak PLR 400 predict mortality  Conclusion Serial blood counts are essential for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for early triaging  and to assess severity and prognosis  The NLR of 6 7 and PLR of 160 require intensive care  The dynamic increase of NLR and PLR show worsening of the disease process and NLR of 40 95 and PLR of 400 predict mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926056
5266,BACKGROUND  The aim of this study was to describe the temporal trend of tuberculosis cases according to sex and age group and evidence the level of disease before the Covid-19 pandemic in a TB high endemic city  METHODS  This was a time series study carried out in a city in northeast Brazil  The population was composed of cases of tuberculosis  excluding those with HIV-positive status  reported between the years 2002 and 2018  An exploratory analysis of the monthly rates of tuberculosis detection  smoothed according to sex and age group  was performed  Subsequently  the progression of the trend and prediction of the disease were also characterized according to these aspects  For the trends forecast  the seasonal autoregressive linear integrated moving average  ARIMA  model and the usual Box-Jenkins method were used to choose the most appropriate models  RESULTS  A total of 1620 cases of tuberculosis were reported  with an incidence of 49 7 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in men and 34 0 per 100 000 in women  Regarding the incidence for both sexes  there was a decreasing trend  which was similar for age  Evidence resulting from the application of the time series shows a decreasing trend in the years 2002-2018  with a trend of stability  CONCLUSIONS  The study evidenced a decreasing trend in tuberculosis  even before the Covid-19 pandemic  for both sex and age  however  in a step really slow from that recommended by the World Health Organization  According to the results  the disease would have achieved a level of stability in the city next years  however it might have been aggravated by the pandemic  These findings are relevant to evidence the serious behavior and trends of TB in a high endemic scenario considering a context prior to the Covid-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922496
2982,Kidney transplant recipients and dialysis patients constitute a risk group for severe COVID-19  They are highly advised to get vaccinated according to the current guidelines  However  data on antibody response  cell responses and protection from events  and factors that might alter this response after a routine full series of vaccination remain incomplete for these populations  The aim of this article was to analyze the antibody responses after a full series of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in kidney transplantation and dialysis patients and to define the factors that alter seroconversion status in these populations  In this systematic review  18 studies investigating the antibody response to full vaccination with two doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in hemodialysis  peritoneal dialysis  and kidney transplant patients were included  Kidney transplant and dialysis patients have a lower seroconversion rate after mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than the healthy population  27 2  for kidney transplantation  88 5  for dialysis patients while all healthy control in these studies seroconverted  Moreover  anti-S antibody titers were lower in seroconverted kidney transplantation or dialysis patients than in healthy control in all studies that assessed this variable  Older age and dialysis vintage  immunosuppressive or chemotherapy treatment  and lower serum albumin  white blood cell  lymphocyte and hemoglobin counts were associated with lower no antibody response to vaccination  Dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients have lower seroconversion rates after a full series of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than the general population  Several factors are associated with an altered antibody response  A third dose could be considered in this patient group,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957748
5212,Melatonin is commonly used for sleep and jetlag at low doses  However  there is less documentation on the safety of higher doses  which are being increasingly used for a wide variety of conditions  including more recently COVID-19 prevention and treatment  The aim of this review was to investigate the safety of higher doses of melatonin in adults  Medline  Scopus  Embase and PsycINFO databases from inception until December 2019 with convenience searches until October 2020  Randomised controlled trials investigating high-dose melatonin  >  10 mg  in human adults over 30 years of age were included  Two investigators independently abstracted articles using PRISMA guidelines  Risk of bias was assessed by a committee of three investigators  79 studies were identified with a total of 3861 participants  Studies included a large range of medical conditions  The meta-analysis was pooled data using a random effects model  The outcomes examined were the number of adverse events  AEs   serious adverse events  SAEs  and withdrawals due to AEs  A total of 29 studies  37   made no mention of the presence or absence of AEs  Overall  only four studies met the pre-specified low risk of bias criteria for meta-analysis  In that small subset  melatonin did not cause a detectable increase in SAEs  Rate Ratio   0 88  0 52  1 50   p    64  or withdrawals due to AEs  0 93  0 24  3 56   p    92   but did appear to increase the risk of AEs such as drowsiness  headache and dizziness  1 40  1 15  1 69   p <  001   Overall  there has been limited AE reporting from high-dose melatonin studies  Based on this limited evidence  melatonin appears to have a good safety profile  Better safety reporting in future long-term trials is needed to confirm this as our confidence limits were very wide due to the paucity of suitable data,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923676
4738,BACKGROUND  Cystic fibrosis  CF  programs and people with CF  PwCF  employed various monitoring methods for virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic  This paper characterizes experiences with remote monitoring across the U S  CF community  METHODS  The CF Foundation  CFF  sponsored distribution of home spirometers  April 2020 to May 2021   surveys to PwCF and CF programs  July to September 2020   and a second program survey  April to May 2021   We used mixed methods to explore access  use  and perspectives regarding the use of remote monitoring in future care  RESULTS  By October 2020  13 345 spirometers had been distributed  and 19 271 spirometers by May 2021  Programs  n 286  estimated proportions of PwCF with home devices increased over seven months  spirometers  30  to 70    scales  50  to 70    oximeters  5  to 10   with higher estimates in adult programs for spirometers and oximeters  PwCF  n 378  had access to scales  89    followed by oximeters  48   and spirometers  47    often using scales and oximeters weekly  and spirometers monthly  Over both surveys  some programs had no method to collect respiratory specimens for cultures associated with telehealth visits  47   n 132  41   n 118   Most programs  81   had a process for phlebotomy associated with a telehealth visit  primarily through off-site labs  Both PwCF and programs felt future care should advance remote monitoring and recommended improvements for access  training  and data collection systems  CONCLUSIONS  PwCF and programs experienced unprecedented access to remote monitoring and raised its importance for future care  Improvements to current systems may leverage these shared experiences to augment future care models,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930544

8868,Background  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic is associated with a heavy burden on patient s mental and physical health  regional healthcare resources  and global economic activity  An aging society such as Japan has many retirement homes and long-term stay hospitals for the elderly and their inhabitants  During the COVID-19 pandemic  disease clusters are often identified in retirement homes and long-term stay hospitals  Although we hypothesize that additional burdens of nursing care for elderly patients will reinforce the anxiety and exhaustion of medical staff and healthcare resources in the aging society  the actual situation is not well understood  In this study  we aimed to evaluate the current situation and countermeasures of the COVID-19 pandemic in the aging society  Methods  We reviewed COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center  a 600-bed capacity hospital located in Kyoto  Japan  between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021  We assessed the characteristics of the COVID-19 patients  disease severity  duration of hospitalization  outcome at discharge  degree of activities of daily living  ADLs   and complications unique to elderly patients  Results  We enrolled 118 patients who required hospitalization during the study period  Approximately 40  of the patients were aged >   80 years  Dementia  27 1   was the most prevalent underlying disease  followed by diabetes mellitus  23 7   and chronic kidney disease  23 7    Approximately 60  of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had impaired ADL at admission  The COVID-19 patients aged 80 years or older required significantly more longer-term hospitalization than the COVID-19 patients aged under 80 years  15 5   - 8 2 vs  13 1   - 7 7  P   0 032   In elderly patients aged 80 years or older  approximately 50  of patients had geriatric mental disorders  and approximately 70  had bedridden status and feeding difficulty  Poor ADL at admission was significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality  Odds ratio  5 6  95  confidence interval  1 04-45 2  p-value   0 044   Conclusions  The proportion of elderly patients aged 80 years or older was relatively high during the hospitalization for COVID-19  Poor ADL at admission in these elderly patients was significantly associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19  We should keep in mind that healthcare workers are forced to have an additional burden of nursing care in the aging society during the COVID-19 pandemic  Therefore  interventions to reduce the burden are urgently required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869479
1935,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated socio-economic disruptions has disproportionally affected marginalized populations including people living with HIV  PLHIV   Little is known about how the pandemic has impacted populations experiencing multiple forms of stigma  discrimination and violence such as female sex workers  FSW  living with HIV  METHODS  We conducted a cross-sectional survey between August and December 2020 among 187 FSW living with HIV in the Dominican Republic  DR  to examine the impact of COVID-19  Using multivariable logistic regression  we examined associations between COVID-19-related financial concerns  mental health  substance use and partner abuse on engagement in HIV care and ART adherence  We conducted mediation analysis to assess whether mental health challenges mediated the impact of partner abuse or substance use on HIV outcomes  RESULTS  Most participants reported no income  72   or a substantial decline in income  25   since the COVID-19 pandemic  Approximately one third  34   reported COVID-19 had an impact on their HIV care and treatment  Greater COVID-19 financial concerns  aOR 1 14  95  CI  1 02-1 27   mental health challenges  aOR 1 38  95  CI  1 06-1 79  and partner emotional abuse  aOR 2 62  95  CI  1 01-6 79  were associated with higher odds of negatively impacted HIV care  respectively  The relationship between increased emotional partner abuse and negatively impacted HIV care was mediated by greater COVID-19-related mental health challenges  CONCLUSION  FSW living with HIV in the DR have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic  Targeted interventions that address structural  financial security  partner abuse  and psychosocial  mental health  factors are needed to sustain HIV outcomes and well-being,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974474
7695,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has rapidly evolved to generate several antigenic variants  These variants have raised concerns whether pre-existing immunity to vaccination or prior infection would be able to protect against the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or not  We isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19 -confirmed patients in the beginning of the first  April May 2020  and second  April May 2021  waves of COVID-19 in India  Hisar  Haryana   Upon complete nucleotide sequencing  the viruses were found to be genetically related with wild-type  WT  and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2  respectively  The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 produced a rapid cytopathic effect  24-36 h as compared to 48-72 h in WT  and had bigger plaque size but a shorter life cycle   6 h as compared to the  8 h in WT   Furthermore  the Delta variant achieved peak viral titers within 24 h as compared to the 48 h in WT  These evidence suggested that the Delta variant replicates significantly faster than the WT SARS-CoV-2  The virus neutralization experiments indicated that antibodies elicited by vaccination are more efficacious in neutralizing the WT virus but significantly less potent against the Delta variant  Our findings have implications in devising suitable vaccination  diagnostic and therapeutic strategies  besides providing insights into understanding virus replication and transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888260
93,BACKGROUND  Several reports linked the use of repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine  HCQ   azithromycin  lopinavir ritonavir  and favipiravir with QT interval prolongation in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection  Little is known about the risk factors for QT interval prolongation in this population  We sought to describe the prevalence and identify the main risk factors associated with clinically significant corrected QT  QTc  prolongation in this population  METHODS  We conducted a retrospective analysis of critically ill patients who were admitted to our intensive care unit  ICU   had at least one electrocardiogram performed during their ICU stay  and tested positive for SARs-CoV-2  Clinically significant QTc interval prolongation was defined as QTc >500 milliseconds  ms   RESULTS  Out of the 111 critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  QTc was significantly prolonged in 47 cases  42 3    Patients with a clinically significant QTc prolongation had significantly higher proportions of history of cardiac diseases surgery  22  46 8   vs  10  15 6    P <  001   hypokalemia  10  21 3  vs  5  7 8    P    04   and male gender  95  vs  82 8   P    036  than patients with QTc <  500 ms  respectively  A total of 46 patients  41 4   received HCQ  28  25 2   received lopinavir ritonavir  and 5  4 5   received azithromycin  Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of cardiac disease was the only independent factor associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation  P    004 for the likelihood-ratio test   CONCLUSION  The prevalence of clinically significant QTc prolongation in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was high and independent of drugs used  Larger prospective observational studies are warranted to elucidate independent risk factors associated with clinically significant QTc prolongation in this study population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006023

3597,Although several theories posit that information seeking is related to better psychological health  this logic may not apply to a pandemic like COVID-19  Given uncertainty inherent to the novel virus  we expect that information seeking about COVID-19 will be positively associated with emotional distress  Additionally  we consider the type of news media from which individuals receive information-television  newspapers  and social media-when examining relationships with emotional distress  Using a U S  national survey  we examine   1  the link between information seeking about COVID-19 and emotional distress   2  the relationship between reliance on television  newspapers  and social media as sources for news and emotional distress  and  3  the interaction between information seeking and use of these news media sources on emotional distress  Our findings show that seeking information about COVID-19 was significantly related to emotional distress  Moreover  even after accounting for COVID-19 information seeking  consuming news via television and social media was tied to increased distress  whereas consuming newspapers was not significantly related to greater distress  Emotional distress was most pronounced among individuals high in information seeking and television news use  whereas the association between information seeking and emotional distress was not moderated by newspapers or social media news use,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948806
4403,Background  Musculoskeletal  MSK  injuries are common but can lead to devastating outcomes  During the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia  it is thought that the burden of traumatic MSK injuries is minimized  Objective  This study aimed to assess the epidemiological characteristics of traumatic MSK injuries during the lockdown period in Saudi Arabia  Materials and Methods  This retrospective descriptive study included all patients who were admitted to the orthopedic department at a single tertiary hospital level 1 trauma center due to traumatic injuries from March 23 to June 21  2020  Results  The study included 92 patients  The majority were male  68 5    The most common comorbidity was hypertension  30 4    Falls were the most common mechanism of injury  47    The most common sites to be fractured were the proximal femur  22 8   followed by the distal tibia fibula  14    Skull fractures  12    rib fractures  6 5    and pneumothorax  6 5   were the most common associated injuries  Age and the number of injuries were significant predictors of increased length of hospital stay  Conclusions  Major considerations for primary prevention must be taken into account during long periods of time with no direct patient interaction  Patient education is important to help avoid any burden that might be caused by otherwise preventable injuries  Further studies should be conducted to assess this phenomenon more in depth and to establish the appropriate method of educating patients on primary prevention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934696
6111,Since 2020  the world saw a myriad of creative health-care policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic  This article studied the experience of rural primary care providers  PCPs  in India deputized for COVID-19 care in urban areas  In-depth interviews were conducted with PCPs  n   19   who served at COVID-19 facilities  Lack of epidemic management and intensive tertiary care experience  limited and inadequate training  and fear of infection emerged as the primary sources of distress  in addition to absent systemic mental health support and formalized recognition  Even so  resilience among the respondents emerged as a result of encouragement from their families  peers  and mentors through various means including social media  and from individual recognition from communities and local governments  Rural PCPs expressed an eagerness to serve at the frontlines of COVID-19 and demonstrated indomitable spirit in the face of an acutely understaffed health system  growing uncertainty  and concerns about personal and family health  It is imperative to reconfigure health-care education and continuing professional development  and equip all health-care professionals with mental health support and the ability to deal with public health emergencies and build a more resilient health workforce,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909242
7398,The systemic processes involved in the manifestation of life-threatening COVID-19 and in disease recovery are still incompletely understood  despite investigations focusing on the dysregulation of immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection  To define hallmarks of severe COVID-19 in acute disease  n   58  and in disease recovery in convalescent patients  n   28  from Hannover Medical School  we used flow cytometry and proteomics data with unsupervised clustering analyses  In our observational study  we combined analyses of immune cells and cytokine chemokine networks with endothelial activation and injury  ICU patients displayed an altered immune signature with prolonged lymphopenia but the expansion of granulocytes and plasmablasts along with activated and terminally differentiated T and NK cells and high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies  The core signature of seven plasma proteins revealed a highly inflammatory microenvironment in addition to endothelial injury in severe COVID-19  Changes within this signature were associated with either disease progression or recovery  In summary  our data suggest that besides a strong inflammatory response  severe COVID-19 is driven by endothelial activation and barrier disruption  whereby recovery depends on the regeneration of the endothelial integrity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893580
1844,The COVID-19 pandemic poses a health threat that has dominated media coverage  However  not much is known about individual media use to acquire knowledge about COVID-19  To address this open research question  this study investigated how the perceived threat is linked to media use and how media use is associated with perceived and actual knowledge about COVID-19  In a German online survey conducted between April 16 and April 27  2020  N   952 participants provided information on their perceived threat and media use to inform themselves about COVID-19  In this process  they indicated how well they were informed about COVID-19  perceived knowledge  and subsequently completed a COVID-19 knowledge test  actual knowledge   Results indicated that individuals who felt more threatened by COVID-19 used media more often to inform themselves  b   0 20  p < 0 001  but focused on fewer different media channels  b   0 01  p < 0 001   Further  frequent media use was associated with higher perceived knowledge  b   0 47  p < 0 001   but not with higher actual knowledge about COVID-19  b   -0 01  p   0 938   reflecting an illusion of knowledge  Additionally  using fewer media channels was linked to higher perceived  b   2 21  p < 0 001  and actual knowledge  b   2 08  p   0 008   Finally  explorative analyses on the use of different media channels revealed that an illusion of knowledge emerged for using social media  public television  and newspapers  Potential explanations for the findings and implications for future research are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975667

3905,The global effort against the COVID-19 pandemic dictates that routine quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is vital for assessing immunity following periodic revaccination against new viral variants  Here  we report a dual-detection fluorescent immunochromatographic assay  DFIA   with a built-in self-calibration process  that enables rapid quantitative detection of neutralizing antibodies that block binding between the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   Thus  this assay is based on the inhibition of binding between ACE2 and the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by neutralizing antibodies  and the affinity of anti-human immunoglobulins for these neutralizing antibodies  Our self-calibrating DFIA shows improved precision and sensitivity with a wider dynamic linear range  due to the incorporation of a ratiometric algorithm of two-reverse linkage signals responding to an analyte  This was evident by the fact that no positive results  0 14  were observed in verified negative samples  while 22 positives were detected in 23 samples from verified convalescent plasma  A comparative analysis of the ability to detect neutralizing antibodies in 266 clinical serum samples including those from vaccine recipients  indicated that the overall percent agreement between DFIA and the commercial ELISA kit was 90 98   Thus  the proposed DFIA provides a more reliable and accurate rapid test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccinations in the community  Therefore  the DFIA based strategy for detecting biomarkers  which uses a ratiometric algorithm based on affinity and inhibition reactions  may be applied to improve the performance of immunochromatographic assays,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942543

8205,Personal protective equipment  PPE  such as face masks is vital in battling the COVID-19 crisis  but the dominant polypropylene-based PPE are lack of antiviral antibacterial activities and environmental friendliness  and have hazardous impact on the soil and aquatic ecosystems  The work presented herein focused on developing biodegradable  antiviral  and antibacterial cellulose nonwovens  AVAB-CNWs  as a multi-functional bioprotective layer for better protection against coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and addressing environmental concerns raised by the piling of COVID-19 related wastes  Both guanidine-based polymer and neomycin sulfate  NEO  were reactive-modified and covalently grafted onto the surface of cellulose nonwovens  thereby conferring outstanding antiviral and antibacterial activities to the nonwovens without deteriorating the microstructure and biodegradability  Through adjusting the grafting amount of active components and selecting appropriate reagents for pretreatment  the antimicrobial activity and hydrophobicity for self-cleaning of the nonwovens can be tuned  More importantly  we demonstrated for the first time that such multi-functional nonwovens are capable of inactivating SARS-CoV-2 instantly  leading to high virucidal activity  > 99 35    which is unachievable by conventional masks used nowadays  Meanwhile  the robust breathability and biodegradability of AVAB-CNWs were well maintained  The applications of the as-prepared nonwovens as high-performance textile can be readily extended to other areas in the fight against COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879581
6412,Wastewater-Based Epidemiology  WBE  is widely used to monitor the progression of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at local levels  In this review  we address the different approaches to the steps needed for this surveillance  sampling wastewaters  WWs   concentrating the virus from the samples and quantifying them by qPCR  focusing on the main limitations of the methodologies used  Factors that can influence SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in WWs include   i  physical parameters as temperature that can hamper the detection in warm seasons and tropical regions   ii  sampling methodologies and timetables  being composite samples and Moore swabs the less variable and more sensitive approaches   iii  virus concentration methodologies that need to be feasible and practicable in simpler laboratories and  iv  detection methodologies that should tend to use faster and cost-effective procedures  The efficiency of WW treatments and the use of WWs for SARS-CoV-2 variants detection are also addressed  Furthermore  we discuss the need for the development of common standardized protocols  although these must be versatile enough to comprise variations among target communities  WBE screening of risk populations will allow for the prediction of future outbreaks  thus alerting authorities to implement early action measurements,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905659
2930,This paper investigates how economic activity impacted Covid-19 infections and all-cause mortality  To this purpose  we exploit the distribution of essential sectors  which were exempted from a national lockdown enacted in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic  across provinces and rich administrative data in a difference-in-differences framework  We find that a standard deviation increase in essential workers per built square kilometre leads to 1 1 additional daily cases and 0 32 additional daily deaths per 100 000 inhabitants  Back of the envelope calculations suggest that about one third  47 000  of the Covid-19 cases and about 13   13 000  of deaths between March and May of 2020 can be attributed to the less stringent lockdown for these sectors  The effect is heterogeneous across sectors  Finally  we find that the local health system played a relevant role in reducing fatalities with a higher number of general practitioners and hospital beds per capita being associated with a lower mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958981
4775,BACKGROUND  Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several types of cancer  suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19  CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for cancer treatment  A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 found a significant CK2 kinase activity  and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses  CIGB-300  originally designed as an anticancer peptide  is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to the CK2 phospho-acceptor sites  Recent preliminary results show the antiviral activity of CIGB-300 using a surrogate model of coronavirus  Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidence  at the molecular level  of how CIGB-300 may interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle within infected human cells  METHODS  Sequence analyses and data from phosphorylation studies were combined to predict infection-induced molecular mechanisms that can be interfered by CIGB-300  Next  we integrated data from multi-omics studies and data focusing on the antagonistic effect on the CK2 kinase activity of CIGB-300  A combination of network and functional enrichment analyses was used  RESULTS  Firstly  from the SARS-CoV studies  we inferred the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on the immune response  Afterwards  from the analysis of multiple omics data  we proposed the action of CIGB-300 from the early stages of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery  We also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions that are responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection  Furthermore  we provided evidence of how CIGB-300 may participate in the attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle  bleeding  coagulation and respiratory disorders  CONCLUSIONS  Our computational analysis proposes putative molecular mechanisms that support the antiviral activity of CIGB-300,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930105
2641,The substantial socioeconomic burden of lung diseases  recently highlighted by the disastrous impact of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  accentuates the need for interventive treatments capable of decelerating disease progression  limiting organ damage  and contributing to a functional tissue recovery  However  this is hampered by the lack of accurate human lung research models  which currently fail to reproduce the human pulmonary architecture and biochemical environment  Induced pluripotent stem cells  iPSCs  and organ-on-chip  OOC  technologies possess suitable characteristics for the generation of physiologically relevant in vitro lung models  allowing for developmental studies  disease modeling  and toxicological screening  Importantly  these platforms represent potential alternatives for animal testing  according to the 3Rs  replace  reduce  refine  principle  and hold promise for the identification and approval of new chemicals under the European REACH  registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemicals  framework  As such  this review aims to summarize recent progress made in human iPSC- and OOC-based in vitro lung models  A general overview of the present applications of in vitro lung models is presented  followed by a summary of currently used protocols to generate different lung cell types from iPSCs  Lastly  recently developed iPSC-based lung models are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962104
2847,Virus-like particles  VLPs  are a versatile  safe  and highly immunogenic vaccine platform  Recently  there are developmental vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2  the causative agent of COVID-19  The COVID-19 pandemic affected humanity worldwide  bringing out incomputable human and financial losses  The race for better  more efficacious vaccines is happening almost simultaneously as the virus increasingly produces variants of concern  VOCs   The VOCs Alpha  Beta  Gamma  and Delta share common mutations mainly in the spike receptor-binding domain  RBD   demonstrating convergent evolution  associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion  Thus  the identification and understanding of these mutations is crucial for the production of new  optimized vaccines  The use of a very flexible vaccine platform in COVID-19 vaccine development is an important feature that cannot be ignored  Incorporating the spike protein and its variations into VLP vaccines is a desirable strategy as the morphology and size of VLPs allows for better presentation of several different antigens  Furthermore  VLPs elicit robust humoral and cellular immune responses  which are safe  and have been studied not only against SARS-CoV-2 but against other coronaviruses as well  Here  we describe the recent advances and improvements in vaccine development using VLP technology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960155
4342,Despite widespread media coverage and public health messaging  many high school students lacked formal education about COVID-19 during the pandemic  Providing this education  particularly to underserved communities  may reduce health disparities and encourage youth to engage in the sciences  Twenty-five medical students at Emory University School of Medicine created a virtual  synchronous  COVID-19 curriculum  Learners included 25 students enrolled in a pipeline program from five high schools in metro-Atlanta  The five lesson topics included virus epidemiology  COVID-19 testing and mask-wearing  vaccine fundamentals  COVID-19 risk in communities  and mental health and wellness  Lessons were standardized through medical student-teacher practice presentations to faculty  The curriculum was evaluated with a 23-item pre- and postsurvey assessing learners  COVID-19 knowledge  attitudes  and practices  Pre- and postsurvey scores were compared using descriptive statistics and paired-samples t test  After the curriculum  learners   N   9  COVID-19 knowledge scores increased from 67  correct to 90  correct  Participants were better able to identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection  define  herd immunity   and describe how socioeconomic status can influence infection risk  In addition  after the curriculum implementation  more learners thought vaccines were safe  with 67  responding that vaccines are  very safe   compared with 0  at pretest  This initiative increased learners  COVID-19 knowledge and established bridges between medical students and underserved communities  These connections are essential to combat misinformation surrounding COVID-19  encourage participation in the sciences from underrepresented areas  and empower students to be health advocates within their communities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935530

8928,Objective  We tested whether COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates during the Delta surge were inversely related to vaccination coverage among the 112 most populous counties in the United States  comprising 44 percent of the country s total population  Methods  We measured vaccination coverage as the percent of the county population fully vaccinated as of July 15  2021  We measured COVID-19 incidence as the number of confirmed cases per 100 000 population during the 14-day period ending August 12  2021 and hospitalization rates as the number of confirmed COVID-19 admissions per 100 000 population during the same 14-day period  Results  In log-linear regression models  a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 28 3  decrease in COVID-19 incidence  95  confidence interval  16 8 - 39 7    a 44 9 percent decrease in the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization  95  CI  28 8 - 61 0    and a 16 6  decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 cases  95  CI  8 4 - 24 8    Inclusion of demographic covariables  as well as county-specific diabetes prevalence  did not weaken the observed inverse relationship with vaccination coverage  A significant inverse relationship between vaccination coverage and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 during August 20 - September 16 was also observed  The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 through June 30  2021  a potential indicator of acquired immunity due to past infection  had no significant relation to subsequent case incidence or hospitalization rates in August  Conclusion  Higher vaccination coverage was associated not only with significantly lower COVID-19 incidence during the Delta surge  but also significantly less severe cases of the disease Public Interest SummaryWe tested whether COVID-19 incidence and hospitalization rates during the Delta variant-related surge were inversely related to vaccination coverage among the 112 most populous counties in the United States  together comprising 44 percent of the country s total population  A 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 28 3  decrease in COVID-19 incidence  a 44 9 percent decrease in the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization  and a 16 6  decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 cases  Inclusion of demographic covariables  as well as county-specific diabetes prevalence  did not weaken the observed inverse relationship with vaccination coverage  A significant inverse relationship between vaccination coverage and COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 during August 20 - September 16 was also observed  Higher vaccination coverage was associated not only with significantly lower COVID-19 incidence during the Delta surge  but also significantly less severe cases of the disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868833
6975,With the outbreak of COVID-19  microbial pollution has gained increasing attention as a threat to human health  Consequently  many research efforts are being devoted to the development of efficient disinfection methods  In this context  hydrogen peroxide  H2O2  stands out as a green and broad-spectrum disinfectant  which can be produced and sprayed in the air directly by cavitation in ultrasonic nebulisation  However  the yield of H2O2 obtained by ultrasonic nebulisation is too low to satisfy the requirements for disinfection by spraying and needs to be improved to achieve efficient disinfection of the air and objects  Herein  we report the introduction of a zinc layer into an ultrasonic nebuliser to improve the production of H2O2 and generate additional Zn 2   by self-corrosion  achieving good disinfecting performance  Specifically  a zinc layer was assembled on the oscillator plate of a commercial ultrasonic nebuliser  resulting in a 21-fold increase in the yield of H2O2 and the production of 4 75 mug mL Zn 2   in the spraying droplets  When the generated water mist was used to treat a bottle polluted with Escherichia coli for 30 min  the sterilisation rate reached 93 53   This ultrasonic nebulisation using a functional zinc layer successfully enhanced the production of H2O2 while generating Zn 2    providing a platform for the development of new methodologies of spray disinfection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899039
9054,Purpose  Vaccination is one of the most important strategy to prevent infections and control epidemics  but it also raises concerns about safety in patients receiving treatments  This study aimed to investigate the rate and factors for unvaccination  as well as adverse reactions and deterioration of disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in psoriatic patients  Methods  A web-based questionnaire survey on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  adverse reactions  and self-reported change of disease condition after vaccination in patients with psoriasis was conducted  Demographic  clinical  and psychological data were collected  Multivariable logistic regression was used in the estimation of associations  Results  A total of 788 psoriatic patients were investigated  and 68 9  reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  Younger age  use of interleukin-17 inhibitors  and symptoms of anxiety were associated with unvaccination  The incidence of overall adverse reactions after vaccination was 30 8   and no severe adverse reaction was reported  The most common local and systemic adverse reactions were pain at the injection site and fatigue  respectively  Most patients reported no change in psoriasis after vaccination  while 16 6  and 4 4  reported slight and significant deteriorations of the disease  respectively  Nonadherence to treatment  symptoms of anxiety and depression  and perceived stress were associated with self-reported deterioration of psoriasis after vaccination  Conclusion  While a favorable safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is observed  receiving biologic treatment is factor for unvaccination in patients with psoriasis  Deterioration of psoriasis reported by a small proportion of patients is partially attributable to mental and behavioral factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866925
9701,Background  Facebook  as the world s most popular social media platform  has been playing various important roles throughout the COVID-19 pandemic  allowing users to produce and share health-related information that both eases and complicates public health communication  However  the characteristics of vaccine-related Facebook content and users  reaction to the vaccine issue has been an unexplored area to date  Methods  To fill the previous knowledge-gap  this exploratory study wants to understand the communication climate of Facebook on the COVID-19 vaccine issue  including the nature of dominant content and users  engagement patterns with them  Therefore  the study analyzes the 10 000 most popular Facebook posts with the highest interactions on the vaccine issue  Results  The results show that Facebook users prioritize more vaccine-related news links  71 22   over other content  The declining interactions on the issue suggests that interaction growth mainly depends on positive news on the vaccine  Finally  users  reaction to the vaccine issue is dominantly positive  though they may show a highly negative attitude toward vaccine misinformation  Conclusions  A few limitations and strengths of this study are discussed along with values and implications  This study for the first time analyzes Bangla language-based Facebook content related to the COVID-19 vaccine issue  which is largely overlooked in global academic research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853675

2039,BACKGROUND  Measuring anti-spike protein antibodies in human plasma or serum is commonly used to determine prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to assess the anti-viral protection capacity  According to the mass-action law  a lesser concentration of tightly binding antibody can produce the same quantity of antibody-antigen complexes as higher concentrations of lower affinity antibody  Thus  measurements of antibody levels reflect both affinity and concentration  These two fundamental parameters cannot be disentangled in clinical immunoassays  and so produce a bias which depends on the assay format  METHODS  To determine the apparent affinity of anti-spike protein antibodies  a small number of antigen-coated magnetic microparticles were imaged by fluorescence microscopy after probing antigen-antibody equilibria directly in patient plasma  Direct and indirect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays were used to measure antibody levels in the blood of infected and immunised individuals  FINDINGS  We observed affinity maturation of antibodies in convalescent and vaccinated individuals  showing that higher affinities are achieved much faster by vaccination  We demonstrate that direct and indirect immunoassays for measuring anti-spike protein antibodies depend differently on antibody affinity which  in turn  affects accurate interpretation of the results  INTERPRETATION  Direct immunoassays show substantial antibody affinity dependence  This makes them useful for identifying past SARS-CoV-2 exposure  Indirect immunoassays provide more accurate quantifications of anti-viral antibody levels  FUNDING  The authors are all full-time employees of Abbott Laboratories  Abbott Laboratories provided all operating funds  No external funding sources were used in this study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971970

8555,Background  Understanding the duration of protection and risk of reinfection after natural infection is crucial to planning COVID-19 vaccination for at-risk groups  including care home residents  particularly with the emergence of more transmissible variants  We report on the duration  neutralising activity  and protection against the alpha variant of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in care home residents and staff infected more than 6 months previously  Methods  We did this prospective observational cohort surveillance in 13 care homes in Greater London  England  All staff and residents were included  Staff and residents had regular nose and throat screening for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR according to national guidelines  with ad hoc testing of symptomatic individuals  From January  2021  antigen lateral flow devices were also used  but positive tests still required RT-PCR confirmation  Staff members took the swab samples for themselves and the residents  The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive primary infection or reinfection in previously infected individuals  as determined by previous serological testing and screening or diagnostic RT-PCR results  Poisson regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate protective effectiveness of previous exposure  SARS-CoV-2 spike  nucleoprotein  and neutralising antibodies were assessed at multiple timepoints as part of the longitudinal follow-up  Findings  Between April 10 and Aug 3  2020  we recruited and tested 1625 individuals  933 staff and 692 residents   248 participants were lost to follow-up  123 staff and 125 residents  and 1377 participants were included in the follow-up period to Jan 31  2021  810 staff and 567 residents   There were 23 reinfections  ten confirmed  eight probable  five possible  in 656 previously infected individuals  366 staff and 290 residents   compared with 165 primary infections in 721 susceptible individuals  444 staff and 277 residents   Those with confirmed reinfections had no or low neutralising antibody concentration before reinfection  with boosting of titres after reinfection  Kinetics of binding and neutralising antibodies were similar in older residents and younger staff  Interpretation  SARS-CoV-2 reinfections were rare in older residents and younger staff  Protection from SARS-CoV-2 was sustained for longer than 9 months  including against the alpha variant  Reinfection was associated with no or low neutralising antibody before reinfection  but significant boosting occurred on reinfection  Funding  Public Health England,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873592
3780,A number of studies have highlighted important alterations of the lipid profile in COVID-19 patients  Besides the well-known atheroprotective function  HDL displays anti-inflammatory  anti-oxidative  and anti-infectious properties  The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the HDL anti-inflammatory and antioxidant features  by evaluation of HDL-associated Serum amyloid A  SAA  enrichment and HDL-paraoxonase 1  PON-1  activity  in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the Cardiorespiratory COVID-19 Unit of Fondazione IRCCS Ca  Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan  COVID-19 patients reached very low levels of HDL-c  mean   - SD  27 1   - 9 7 mg dL  with a marked rise in TG  mean   - SD  165 9   - 62 5 mg dL   Compared to matched-controls  SAA levels were significantly raised in COVID-19 patients at admission  There were no significant differences in the SAA amount between 83 alive and 22 dead patients for all-cause in-hospital mortality  Similar findings were reached in the case of PON-1 activity  with no differences between alive and dead patients for all-cause in-hospital mortality  In conclusion  although not related to the prediction of in-hospital mortality  reduction in HDL-c and the enrichment of SAA in HDL are a mirror of SARS-CoV-2 positivity even at the very early stages of the infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945250
1671,Facing the ongoing coronavirus infectious disease-2019  COVID-19  pandemic  many studies focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in indoor environment  on solid surface or in wastewater  It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over into outdoor environments and impose transmission risks to surrounding people and communities  In this study  we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in 118 samples from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan  We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils  205-550 copies g   aerosols  285-1 130 copies m 3   and wastewaters  255-18 744 copies L  in locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors  These findings revealed a significant viral spillover in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2  In contrast  SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular implemented disinfection  Soils may behave as viral warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time  For the first time  our findings demonstrate that there are high-risk areas out of expectation in hospital outdoor environments to spread SARS-CoV-2  calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977842
2154,Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies  AB  against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for managing the COVID-19 pandemic  Current tests have certain limitations with regard to turnaround time  costs and availability  particularly in point-of-care  POC  settings  We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody  nanobody  binding red blood cells  RBD  and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen  such as the receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein  Spike-RBD   While the nanobody mediates swift binding to RBC  the antigen moiety directs instantaneous  visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals  Method comparison studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity  To further increase objectivity of test interpretation  we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image acquisition  via a cell phone  and a machine learning algorithm based on defined sample-training and -validation datasets  Preliminary data  including a small clinical study  provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC setting  Together  the data support the interpretation that this AB test format  which we refer to as  NanoSpot ai   is suitable for POC testing  can be manufactured at very low costs and  based on its generic mode of action  can likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969960
8119,COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for a well-trained public health workforce to save lives through timely outbreaks detection and response  In Yemen  a country that is entering its seventh year of a protracted war  the ongoing conflict severely limited the country s capacity to implement effective preparedness and response measures to outbreaks including COVID-19  There are growing concerns that the virus may be circulating within communities undetected and unmitigated especially as underreporting continues in some areas of the country due to a lack of testing facilities  delays in seeking treatment  stigma  difficulty accessing treatment centers  the perceived risks of seeking care or for political issues  The Yemen Field Epidemiology Training Program  FETP  was launched in 2011 to address the shortage of a skilled public health workforce  with the objective of strengthening capacity in field epidemiology  Thus  events of public health importance can be detected and investigated in a timely and effective manner  During the COVID-19 pandemic  the Yemen FETP s response has been instrumental through participating in country-level coordination  planning  monitoring  and developing guidelines standard operating procedures and strengthening surveillance capacities  outbreak investigations  contact tracing  case management  infection prevention  and control  risk communication  and research  As the third wave is circulating with a steeper upward curve than the previous ones with possible new variants  the country will not be able to deal with a surge of cases as secondary care is extremely crippled  Since COVID-19 prevention and control are the only option available to reduce its grave impact on morbidity and mortality  health partners should support the Yemen FETP to strengthen the health system s response to future epidemics  One important lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic  especially in the Yemen context and applicable to developing and war-torn countries  is that access to outside experts becomes limited  therefore  it is crucial to invest in building national expertise to provide timely  cost-effective  and sustainable services that are culturally appropriate  It is also essential to build such expertise at the governorate and district levels  as they are normally the first respondents  and to provide them with the necessary tools for immediate response in order to overcome the disastrous delays,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881214

4903,INTRODUCTION    5-Aminolevulinic acid  5-ALA  is a naturally synthesized amino acid present in most plants as well as animals  and it is routinely consumed by humans  This brief report sought to describe the potential of 5-ALA and sodium-ferrous citrate  5-ALA SFC  to ameliorate the course of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   AREAS COVERED    Studies have shown that 5-ALA is converted to protoporphyrin IX  PPIX   then to heme  Recent studies have demonstrated that PPIX has antiviral effects against several viruses  including Zika virus  dengue virus  and influenza A virus  The anti-inflammatory effects of 5-ALA have also been reported in humans  Preliminary in vitro and clinical studies have shown that the combination of 5-ALA SFC could reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -mediated insults  The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains guanine-quadruplex sequences  and the administration of 5-ALA SFC can lead to the generation of porphyrins that have the ability to bind to guanine-quadruplexes and reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2  Furthermore  5-ALA is a metabolic precursor of heme  which is a potent inducer of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1  the levels of which are decreased in patients with severe COVID-19  Oral administration of 5-ALA SFC induced heme oxygenase-1 in the peripheral blood of uninfected healthy individuals  EXPERT OPINION    Based on the available information  it appears likely that 5-ALA SFC has therapeutic value in clinically controlling SARS-CoV-2-mediated insults in COVID-19 patients  Multicenter randomized controlled trials are needed for determining the long-term clinical utility of 5-ALA SFC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927515
3660,In humans  over-activation of innate immunity in response to viral or bacterial infections often causes severe illness and death  Furthermore  similar mechanisms related to innate immunity can cause pathogenesis and death in sepsis  massive trauma  including surgery and burns   ischemia reperfusion  some toxic lesions  and viral infections including COVID-19  Based on the reviewed observations  we suggest that such severe outcomes may be manifestations of a controlled suicidal strategy protecting the entire population from the spread of pathogens and from dangerous pathologies rather than an aberrant hyperstimulation of defense responses  We argue that innate immunity may be involved in the implementation of an altruistic programmed death of an organism aimed at increasing the well-being of the whole community  We discuss possible ways to suppress this atavistic program by interfering with innate immunity and suggest that combating this program should be a major goal of future medicine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948277
7471,Many recent studies show that the COVID-19 pandemic has been severely affecting the mental wellness of people with Parkinson s disease  In this study  we propose a machine learning-based approach to predict the level of anxiety and depression among participants with Parkinson s disease using surveys conducted before and during the pandemic in order to provide timely intervention  The proposed method successfully predicts one s depression level using automated machine learning with a root mean square error  RMSE  of 2 841  In addition  we performed model importance and feature importance analysis to reduce the number of features from 5 308 to 4 for maximizing the survey completion rate while minimizing the RMSE and computational complexity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891734
8819,In this review  we present the safest and most effective diagnosis and treatment approaches to dysphagia during the novel coronavirus-2019  COVID-19  pandemic in the light of available data  relevant literature  and personal experiences  Evaluations for dysphagia patients should be based on clinical assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and instrumental assessment should be planned for very few number of patients  The main approach to rehabilitation must depend on compensatory methods  texture-modified foods  and postural strategies  Direct treatment methods should be avoided and home-based exercise programs should be encouraged  It is also obvious that there is a need for the development of new strategies for telemedicine telerehabilitation practices in the new world order,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870112
1242,The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown up innumerable challenges throughout the world  especially evident in the healthcare system  In emergency medicine  there is a new urgency around the clinical and ethical dilemmas clinicians face as they make decisions that impact upon the lives of their patients  Emergency clinicians are accustomed to upholding duty of care and acting in the best interests of patients  Clinical judgements are made every day about a patient s capacity to make their own decisions and act with free will  It is foreseeable that a duty of care owed to a patient may be in conflict with the responsibility to the health and safety of a community  What is particularly fraught for clinicians is the lack of clarity around this potential duty of care to the community  and navigating the potential conflict with duty of care to the patient  How much danger does the community need to be in  and how definable  imminent and specific does that risk need to be  An attempt to protect the community may well constitute either a breach of confidentiality or a breach of duty of care  This paper will explore the complex issues of respect for autonomy and the principle of non-maleficence  in the setting of COVID-19 and public health orders and illustrate the uncomfortable uncertainty that exists surrounding care of some of the most vulnerable patients in the community when their actions are contrary to public health recommendations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984843
5118,This study develops a novel mathematical model to design a sustainable mask Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network  CLSCN  during the COVID-19 outbreak for the first time  A multi-objective Mixed-Integer Linear Programming  MILP  model is proposed to address the locational  supply  production  distribution  collection  quarantine  recycling  reuse  and disposal decisions within a multi-period multi-echelon multi-product supply chain  Additionally  sustainable development is studied in terms of minimizing the total cost  total pollution and total human risk at the same time  Since the CLSCN design is an NP-hard problem  Multi-Objective Grey Wolf Optimization  MOGWO  algorithm and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II  NSGA-II  are implemented to solve the proposed model and to find Pareto optimal solutions  Since Meta-heuristic algorithms are sensitive to their input parameters  the Taguchi design method is applied to tune and control the parameters  Then  a comparison is performed using four assessment metrics including Max-Spread  Spread of Non-Dominance Solution  SNS   Number of Pareto Solutions  NPS   and Mean Ideal Distance  MID   Additionally  a statistical test is employed to evaluate the quality of the obtained Pareto frontier by the presented algorithms  The obtained results reveal that the MOGWO algorithm is more reliable to tackle the problem such that it is about 25  superior to NSGA-II in terms of the dispersion of Pareto solutions and about 2  superior in terms of the solution quality  To validate the proposed mathematical model and testing its applicability  a real case study in Tehran Iran is investigated as well as a set of sensitivity analyses on important parameters  Finally  the practical implications are discussed and useful managerial insights are given,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924699
2328,Viral diseases have long been among the biggest challenges for healthcare systems around the world  The recent Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic is an example of how complicated the situation can get if we are not prepared to combat a viral outbreak in time  which brings up the need for quick and affordable biosensing platforms and vast knowledge of potential antiviral effects and drug gene delivery opportunities  The same challenges have also existed for nonviral immunogenic disorders  Nanomedicine is considered a novel candidate for effectively overcoming these worldwide challenges  Among the versatile nanomaterials commonly used in biomedical applications  graphene has recently earned much attention thanks to its special and inspiring physicochemical properties  such as its large surface area  efficient thermal electrical properties  carbon-based chemical purity with controllable biocompatibility  easy functionalization  capability of single-molecule detection  anticancer characteristics  3D template feature in tissue engineering  and  in particular  antibacterial antiviral activities  In this Review  the most important and challenging viruses of our era  such as human immunodeficiency virus  Ebola  SARS-CoV-2  norovirus  and hepatitis virus  and immunogenic disorders  such as asthma  Alzheimer s disease  and Parkinson s disease  in which graphene-based nanomaterials can effectively take part in the prevention  detection  treatment  medication  and health effect issues  have been covered and discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967216
2119,Reports of COVID-19 cases potentially attributed to fomite transmission led to the extensive use of various disinfectants to control viral spread  Alternative disinfectants  such as essential oils  have emerged as a potential antimicrobial  Four essential oil blends were tested on three different surfaces inoculated with a coronavirus surrogate  bacteriophage Phi 6  and a bacterial indicator  Staphylococcus aureus  Log10 concentration reductions were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software  Data collected in this study show that the application of dilute essential oil disinfectants using a spray delivery device is an effective way to reduce concentrations of bacterial and viral microorganisms on ceramic  stainless steel  and laminate surfaces  Surrogate viruses were reduced up to 6 log10 PFU and bacterial were reduced up to 4 log10 CFU  Although surfaces are no longer considered a high risk fomite for COVID-19 transmission  the disinfection of microorganisms on surfaces remains an important consideration for high touch areas in hospitals  waiting rooms  etc  The application of spray disinfectants  based on essential oil blends  provides a rapid and effective means to reduce microbial contamination on high-touched surfaces,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970529
9368,BACKGROUND  Long COVID is a common occurrence following COVID-19 infection  The most common symptom reported is fatigue  Limited interventional treatment options exist  We report the first evaluation of hyperbaric oxygen therapy  HBOT  for long COVID treatment  METHODS  A total of 10 consecutive patients received 10 sessions of HBOT to 2 4 atmospheres over 12 days  Each treatment session lasted 105 minutes  consisting of three 30-minute exposures to 100  oxygen  interspersed with 5-minute air breaks  Validated fatigue and cognitive scoring assessments were performed at day 1 and 10  Statistical analysis was with Wilcoxon signed-rank testing reported alongside effect sizes  RESULTS  HBOT yielded a statistically significant improvement in the Chalder fatigue scale  p 0 0059  d 1 75  very large    global cognition  p 0 0137  d -1 07  large    executive function  p 0 0039  d -1 06  large    attention  p 0 0020  d -1 2  very large    information processing  p 0 0059  d -1 25  very large   and verbal function  p 0 0098  d -0 92  large    CONCLUSION  Long COVID-related fatigue can be debilitating  and may affect young people who were previously in economic employment  The results presented here suggest potential benefits of HBOT  with statistically significant results following 10 sessions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862223
6202,Aim  We aimed to assess the consequences of dealing with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period on the mental state of health-care workers  Materials and Methods  An anonymous online survey was conducted with 353 participants using a self-made questionnaire comparing the prevalence of low mood  apprehension  tension  and coping skills used and the Depression  Anxiety  and Stress Scale-21  The data were analyzed to compare the mental health of male and female doctors  To identify predictors of mental health outcomes  a multivariate logistic regression was carried out  Results  Both men and women were almost equally affected in terms of developing features of low mood  with easy physical and mental exhaustion  While the feeling of being isolated and irritability was slightly higher in females  both sexes were equally affected by the media  It was observed that the prevalence of smoking  tobacco marijuana  etc   had increased in both with slightly higher percentage in males as compared to females while there was a considerable increase in caffeine and alcohol consumption in males  The sleeping pattern and appetite were equally affected in both sexes  The sexual drive was also altered in both male and female residents  but the change was considerably more in males  The significant predictors of anxiety were age  depression  mental exhaustion  burden of increased quantity of work  and feeling of having no choice but to work due to obligation  Conclusion  Both male and female doctors working during the COVID-19 pandemic developed anxiety and depression  While substance use and altered sexual drive were more in males  exhaustion and stress were more in females,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908666
9447,BACKGROUND  Six months into the COVID-19 pandemic  college campuses faced uncertainty regarding the likely prevalence and spread of disease  necessitating large-scale testing to help guide policy during following re-entry  METHODS  A SARS-CoV-2 testing program combining pooled saliva sample surveillance leading to diagnosis and intervention surveyed over 112 000 samples from 18 029 students  staff and faculty  as part of integrative efforts to mitigate transmission at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Fall 2020  RESULTS  Cumulatively  we confirmed 1 508 individuals diagnostically  62  of these through the surveillance program and the remainder through diagnostic tests of symptomatic individuals administered on or off campus  The total strategy  including intensification of testing given case clusters early in the semester  was associated with reduced transmission following rapid case increases upon entry in Fall semester in August 2020  again in early November 2020  and upon re-entry for Spring semester in January 2021  During the Fall semester daily asymptomatic test positivity initially peaked at 4 1  but fell below 0 5  by mid-semester  averaging 0 84  across the Fall semester  with similar levels of control in Spring 2021  CONCLUSIONS  Owing to broad adoption by the campus community  we estimate that the program protected higher risk staff and faculty while allowing some normalization of education and research activities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860727

6300,Summary  There is emerging evidence of an association between COVID-19 vaccination and subacute thyroiditis  We present the case of a 42-year-old female healthcare worker who was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis 4 days after receiving her second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine  Her clinical course followed the classical pattern for thyroiditis with spontaneous return to euthyroidism at 6 months post-presentation  The autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants has been implicated as a cause of autoimmune conditions post-vaccination and is a potential mechanism for subacute thyroiditis in our case  Learning points  Subacute thyroiditis should be considered in all patients who receive any kind of vaccine for COVID-19 and subsequently develop symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism or neck pain  Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limiting condition  and recognising it is important as no specific thyroid treatment  antithyroid drugs or thyroid hormone replacement  is necessary for most patients  The autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants may be an under-recognised cause of endocrinopathies and should particularly be considered post-vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907904
1617,OBJECTIVES  The First Nations people experience significant challenges that may influence the ability to follow COVID-19 public health directives on-reserve  This study aimed to describe experiences  perceptions and circumstances of an Alberta First Nations community  related to COVID-19 public health advice  We hypothesized that many challenges ensued when following and implementing advice from public health experts  METHODS  With First Nations leadership and staff  an online cross-sectional survey was deployed between April 24 and June 25  2020  It assessed the appropriateness of public health advice to curb COVID-19 within this large First Nations community  Both quantitative and qualitative data were captured and described  RESULTS  A total of 106 adults living on-reserve responded  over 80  were female  Difficulty accessing food was significant by employment status  p   0 0004   Those people with lower income found accessing food  p   0 0190  and getting essential medical care  p   0 0060   clothing  p   0 0280  and transportation  p   0 0027  more difficult  Some respondents described lost income associated with COVID-19 experiences  as well as difficulties accessing essential supplies  Respondents found  proper handwashing  most easy  98   and  keeping a distance of 2 m from others  most difficult  23    Many respondents found following public health advice within their personal domain easy and put  family safety  first but experienced some difficulties when navigating social aspects and obligations  particularly when unable to control the actions of others  People stated wanting clear information  but were sometimes critical of the COVID-19 response  CONCLUSION  First Nations people face many additional challenges within the COVID-19 response  driven in part by ongoing issues related to significant societal  economic  and systemic factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978681
1965,The COVID-19 pandemic led to the deployment of an unprecedented academic and industrial research effort  the sometimes redundant nature of which is regrettable  as is the lack of both national and international management  However  it must be noted that during this crisis  regulatory procedures were adapted and certain obstacles in the organisation of clinical research were partly removed to contribute to the deployment of trials as close as possible to patients and to facilitate monitoring and control procedures  The digitisation of certain processes and the decentralisation of certain activities were implemented under the cover of a mobilisation of the authorities and all institutional  academic and industrial players  While in the UK  the optimisation of resources through a single platform trial has made it possible to demonstrate or invalidate the efficacy of many treatments  in France the health crisis has highlighted the fragility of the organisation of clinical research  in particular a lack of coordination and funding  difficulties in implementing studies and a certain reluctance to share data  However  the crisis has also revealed the adaptability of the various stakeholders and has led to the improvement of several processes useful for the deployment of therapeutic innovation  Let us hope that the lessons learned during this crisis will allow for greater efficiency in the event of a new pandemic and  above all  that the progress made will continue to apply to all future clinical research activities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973823
7868,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 disease first appeared in 2019 and quickly spread worldwide  causing a global pandemic  The oral cavity represents a target of SARS-CoV-2  and oral lesions are observed in both non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients  This systematic review aims to investigate the frequency of oral manifestations in COVID-19 hospitalized patients  METHODS  An electronic search was conducted in PubMed  Scopus  and Web of Science databases  including articles published up to September 2021  The review protocol was based on PRISMA-P  The risk of bias of the studies was assessed using the Joana Briggs Institute  The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE instrument  RESULTS  Fifty-nine articles were included  19 case reports  17 case series  2 case-control studies  13 cross-sectional studies  4 observational studies  and 4 retrospective studies  Oral ulcers  cheilitis  and tongue lesions were more common in patients before hospitalization  while perioral pressure ulcers  macroglossia  blisters  and oral candidiasis were more recurrent in patients during hospitalization  The first could be related directly to COVID-19  while the latter could be caused by medical devices  treatments  prone position  and immunological impairment  CONCLUSIONS  An accurate oral examination during the hospital admission of all confirmed COVID-19 cases is encouraged to recognize oral early manifestations and to apply appropriate treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886241
8454,Since the end of 2019  the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has evolved into a global pandemic  There is an urgent need for effective and low-toxic antiviral drugs to remedy Remdesivir s limitation  Hydroxychloroquine  a broad spectrum anti-viral drug  showed inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in some studies  Thus  we adopted a drug repurposing strategy  and further investigated hydroxychloroquine  We obtained different configurations of hydroxychloroquine side chains by using chiral resolution technique  and successfully furnished R- S-hydroxychloroquine sulfate through chemical synthesis  The R configuration of hydroxychloroquine was found to exhibit higher antiviral activity  EC50   3 05 muM  and lower toxicity in vivo  Therefore  R-HCQ is a promising lead compound against SARS-CoV-2  Our research provides new strategy for the subsequent research on small molecule inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875467
4866,BACKGROUND  Myocardial damage worsens the clinical course and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  patients  High total bilirubin levels have been associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19  This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the total bilirubin level  a marker of heme oxygenase-1 enzyme activity  in determining myocarditis in patients with COVID-19  RESULTS  A total of 190 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study  The patients were divided into two groups based on their troponin positivity  The study group  n   95  consisted of patients with high troponin  and the control group  n   95  consisted of patients without high troponin levels  The D-dimer  727  572-995  vs  591  440-790   p   0 001   C-reactive protein  CRP   30 0  10-48  vs  10 3  5 8-15 9   p < 0 001   and total bilirubin  9 5  8 2-12 1  vs  7 0  5 3-8 0   p < 0 001  levels were significantly higher in the study group  In multivariate analysis  CRP  odds ratio  OR   1 103  95  confidence interval  CI   1 060-1 148  p < 0 001  and total bilirubin  OR  1 612  95  CI  1 330-1 954  p < 0 001  levels were independent predictors of myocarditis in COVID-19  CONCLUSIONS  Total bilirubin levels can be used as an early predictor of myocarditis in COVID-19 and can contribute to therapy management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928467
3746,During COVID19 pandemic  SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests  RATs  were marketed with minimal or no performance data  We aimed at closing this gap by determining technical sensitivities and specificities of 30 RATs prior to market release  We developed a standardized technical validation protocol and assessed 30 RATs across four diagnostic laboratories  RATs were tested in parallel using the Standard Q  R    SD Biosensor Roche  assay as internal reference  We used left-over universal transport optimum media from nasopharyngeal swabs of 200 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-negative and 100 PCR-positive tested patients  Transport media was mixed with assay buffer and applied to RATs according to manufacturer instructions  Sensitivities were determined according to viral loads  Specificity of at least 99  and sensitivity of 95   90   and 80  had to be reached for 10 7   10 6   10 5  virus copies mL  respectively  Sensitivities ranged from 43 5  to 98 6   62 3  to 100   and 66 7  to 100  at 10 5   10 6   10 7  copies mL  respectively  Automated assay readers such as ExDia or LumiraDx showed higher performances  Specificities ranged from 88 8  to 100   Only 15 of 30  50   RATs passed our technical validation  Due to the high failure rate of 50   mainly caused by lack of sensitivity  we recommend a thorough validation of RATs prior to market release,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946190
3902,Humans have infected a wide range of animals with SARS-CoV-2 viruses 1-5   but the establishment of a new natural animal reservoir has not been observed  Here  we document that free-ranging white-tailed deer  Odocoileus virginianus  are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus  are exposed to a range of viral diversity from humans  and are capable of sustaining transmission in nature  SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected by rRT-PCR in more than one-third  129 360  35 8   of nasal swabs obtained from Odocoileus virginianus in northeast Ohio  USA  during January-March 2021  Deer in 6 locations were infected with 3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages  B 1 2  B 1 582  B 1 596   The B 1 2 viruses  dominant in humans in Ohio at the time  infected deer in four locations  Probable deer-to-deer transmission of B 1 2  B 1 582  and B 1 596 viruses was observed  allowing the virus to acquire amino acid substitutions in the spike protein  including the receptor-binding domain  and ORF1 that are infrequently seen in humans  No spillback to humans was observed  but these findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have the capacity to transmit in US wildlife  potentially opening new pathways for evolution  There is an urgent need to establish comprehensive  One Health  programs to monitor deer  the environment  and other wildlife hosts globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942632
6840,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is primarily a respiratory illness and pulmonary manifestations are the typical presentations of the disease  However  it became evident that the COVID-19 is not limited to the respiratory system  Specifically  gastrointestinal involvement in patients with COVID-19 is very common  particularly in patients with a critical illness  We present a case of a 52-year-old man who was diagnosed as having severe COVID-19 pneumonia and underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation  The patient remained in the intensive care unit for seven days  Following his recovery  he started to experience generalized abdominal pain  The pain did not resolve with conservative measures  A computed tomography scan of the abdomen demonstrated small bowel loops clustered with a surrounding thin membrane  Such findings conferred the diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis  The patient was prepared for laparoscopic surgery  Resection of the membrane was performed without any injury to the encapsulated bowel  Analysis of peritoneal fluid by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  was positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The patient had an uneventful recovery  Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a very rare condition associated with COVID-19 pneumonia  The present case is the first reported case to document the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the peritoneal fluid in a patient with sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900482
9141,COIVD-19 vaccination of medical students is essential since these students will have contact with patients and will become future healthcare leaders  Hence  we surveyed medical students at Texas Tech University Health Science Center in Lubbock  TX  and received 234 responses  The majority of students were vaccinated against COVID-19  215 234  91 8   and reported pro-vaccine attitudes  such as support for a COVID-19 booster shot  191 234  81 6   and an annual COVID-19 vaccine  186 234  79 5    Among those who did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine  the most frequent reasons included waiting for more evidence  16 19  84 2   and concern about the side effects  15 19  79 0    These results indicate that medical students consider vaccination important and suggest that students can provide an important resource for patients and public education,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866490
1468,The Delta variant of concern of SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally causing large outbreaks and resurgences of COVID-19 cases  1-3    The emergence of Delta in the UK occurred on the background of a heterogeneous landscape of immunity and relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions  4 5    Here we analyse 52 992 Delta genomes from England in combination with 93 649 global genomes to reconstruct the emergence of Delta  and quantify its introduction to and regional dissemination across England  in the context of changing travel and social restrictions  Through analysis of human movement  contact tracing  and virus genomic data  we find that the focus of geographic expansion of Delta shifted from India to a more global pattern in early May 2021  In England  Delta lineages were introduced >1 000 times and spread nationally as non-pharmaceutical interventions were relaxed  We find that hotel quarantine for travellers from India reduced onward transmission from importations  however the transmission chains that later dominated the Delta wave in England had been already seeded before restrictions were introduced  In England  increasing inter-regional travel drove Delta s nationwide dissemination  with some cities receiving >2 000 observable lineage introductions from other regions  Subsequently  increased levels of local population mixing  not the number of importations  was associated with faster relative growth of Delta  Among US states  we find that regions that previously experienced large waves also had faster Delta growth rates  and a model including interactions between immunity and human behaviour could accurately predict the rise of Delta there  Delta s invasion dynamics depended on fine scale spatial heterogeneity in immunity and contact patterns and our findings will inform optimal spatial interventions to reduce transmission of current and future VOCs such as Omicron,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981069

267,Introduction  The COVID-19 pandemic that hit Spain during March 2020 forced the strict confinement of the population for 2 months  The objectives of this study were  a  to assess the magnitude and duration of the influence of confinement on people s Distress   b  to study the temporal sequence of stress  and  c  to show how different day-to-day activities and personal variables influence perceived Distress levels  Method  A daily registration was completed by 123 people  with ages ranging from 21 to 75 years old   X   43  SD   10 years   of which there were 40 men  32   and 83 females  68    During 45 days of lockdown  from March 19th to May 3rd  participants were asked to respond to a socio-demographic survey and make daily records comprising the MASQ-D30 and some day-to-day behaviors  Pooled time series was applied to establish what effect time had on the dependent variable  Results  Distress has a 14-day autoregressive function and gender  physical activity  sexual activity  listening to music  and teleworking also influence Distress  It has been hypothesized that the intercept presents variability at level 2  individual   but it has not been significant  Interactions between Gender-Telecommuting  and Gender-Physical Activity were observed  Approximately 66  of the variance of Distress was explained  R  2    0 663   Discussion  At the beginning of the lockdown  the average levels of Distress were well above the levels of the end  z   3 301   The individuals in the sample have followed a very similar process in the development of Distress  During the lockdown  the  memory  of Distress was 2 weeks  Our results indicate that levels of Distress depend on activities during lockdown  Interactions exist between gender and some behavioral variables that barely influence Distress in men but decrease Distress in women  The importance of routine maintenance and gender differences must be considered to propose future interventions during confinement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002862
354,The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions to global operations and supply chains  While the huge impact of the pandemic has nurtured important literature over the last couple of years  little is being said about the role of resource orchestration in supporting resilience in highly disruptive contexts  Thus  this study aims to this knowledge gap by proposing an original model to explore supply chain resilience  SCRE  antecedents  considering supply chain alertness  SCAL  as a central point to support resilience  This study focuses on the resource orchestration theory  ROT  to design a conceptual model  The partial least squares structural equation modeling  PLS-SEM  served to validate the model  exploring data from the UK supply chain decision-makers  The study reveals a number of both expected and unexpected findings  These include the evidence that supply chain disruption orientation  SCDO  has a strong positive effect on the SCAL  In addition  SCAL plays a strong positive effect in resource reconfiguration  RREC   supply chain efficiency  SCEF  and SCRE  We further identified a partial mediation effect of RREC on the relationship between SCAL and SCRE  Surprisingly  it appeared that SCAL strongly influences SCEF  while SCEF itself does not create any significant effect on SCRE  For managers and practitioners  the importance of resource orchestration as a decisive approach to adequately respond to huge disruptions is clearly highlighted by our results  Finally  this paper helps to grasp better how important resource orchestration in operations and supply chains remains for appropriate responses to high disruptions such as the COVID-19 impacts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002082
5431,BACKGROUND  Camps of forcibly displaced populations are considered to be at risk of large COVID-19 outbreaks  Low screening rates and limited surveillance led us to conduct a study in Dagahaley camp  located in the Dadaab refugee complex in Kenya to estimate SARS-COV-2 seroprevalence and  mortality and to identify changes in access to care during the pandemic  METHODS  To estimate seroprevalence  a cross-sectional survey was conducted among a sample of individuals  n   587  seeking care at the two main health centres and among all household members  n   619  of community health workers and traditional birth attendants working in the camp  A rapid immunologic assay was used  BIOSYNEX R  COVID-19 BSS  IgG IgM   and adjusted for test performance and mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population  To estimate mortality  all households  n   12860  were exhaustively interviewed in the camp about deaths occurring from January 2019 through March 2021  RESULTS  In total 1206 participants were included in the seroprevalence study  8   95  CI  6 6 -9 7   had a positive serologic test  After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age  a seroprevalence of 5 8  was estimated  95  CI  1 6 -8 4    The mortality rate for 10 000 persons per day was 0 05  95  CI 0 05-0 06  prior to the pandemic and 0 07  95  CI 0 06-0 08  during the pandemic  representing a significant 42  increase  p<0 001   Medecins Sans Frontieres health centre consultations and hospital admissions decreased by 38  and 37  respectively  CONCLUSION  The number of infected people was estimated 67 times higher than the number of reported cases  Participants aged 50 years or more were among the most affected  The mortality survey shows an increase in the mortality rate during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic  A decline in attendance at health facilities was observed and sustained despite the easing of restrictions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919545
465,The early phases of the coronavirus 19 disease  COVID-19  pandemic were associated with changes in psychological well-being and alcohol use  However  it is unclear whether these changes are artifacts of psychological well-being and alcohol use prior to the pandemic across different sociodemographic groups  We received surveys from 247 adult residents of Allegheny County  Pennsylvania  United States   with an oversampling of sexual- and gender-minority individuals  Responses included measures of psychological well-being  substance use  and sociodemographic characteristics  Unadjusted mean depression scores  anxiety scores  and number of drinking days increased for all age and income groups during COVID-19  while average number of drinks per drinking day and days intoxicated differentially increased or decreased by age and income groups  Using Bayesian seemingly unrelated regression  we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms and alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic and one month before COVID-19 was first identified in Allegheny County concurrently  Those in the youngest  18-24  group drank on more days during  but not before  the pandemic than those in the 25-44 age group  Compared to cisgender women  gender-minority adults had higher depression scores during the early stages of the pandemic  Employed adults had lower anxiety scores during  but not before  the pandemic than adults who were unemployed  Those with past-year annual incomes above  80 000 had fewer drinks on average drinking occasions than those in the  40 000 or below group before  but not during  the pandemic  Patterns of psychological distress and alcohol use associated with the COVID-19 pandemic differ by subgroup compared to patterns prior to the pandemic  Interventions addressing worsening mental health outcomes and shifting alcohol use patterns must be sensitive to the needs of vulnerable groups  such as younger adults and those experiencing poverty or unemployment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000570
118,The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of disposable plastics  including medical masks  which have become a necessity in our daily lives  As these are often improperly disposed of  they represent an important potential source of microplastics in the environment  We prepared microplastics from polypropylene medical masks and characterised their size  shape  organic chemical leaching  and acute toxicity to the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna  The three layers of the masks were separately milled and characterised  Each of the inner frontal  middle filtering  and outer layers yielded different types of microplastics  fibres were obtained from the inner and outer layer  but irregular fragments from the middle layer  The shape of the obtained microplastics differed from the initial fibrous structure of the intact medical mask layers  which indicates that the material is deformed during cryo-milling  The chemical compositions of plastics-associated chemicals also varied between the different layers  Typically  the inner layer contained more chemicals related to antimicrobial function and flavouring  The other two layers also contained antioxidants and their degradation products  plasticisers  cross-linking agents  antistatic agents  lubricants  and non-ionic surfactants  An acute study with D  magna showed that these microplastics do not cause immobility but do physically interact with the daphnids  Further long-term studies with these microplastics are needed using a suite of test organisms  Indeed  studies with other polypropylene microplastics have shown numerous adverse effects on other organisms at concentrations that have already been reported in the environment  Further efforts should be made to investigate the environmental hazards of polypropylene microplastics from medical masks and how to handle this new source of environmental burden  Please check the SI word document The authors are not listed there I cannot edit that file Please add the authors Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1186 s43591-021-00020-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005629

8615,The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global crisis in which governments had to act in a situation of rapid change and substantial uncertainty  The governments of Germany  Sweden and the UK have taken different paths allowing learning for future pandemic preparedness  To help inform discussions on preparedness  inspired by resilience frameworks  this paper reviews governance structures  and the role of science and the media in the COVID-19 response of Germany  Sweden and the UK in 2020  We mapped legitimacy  interdependence  knowledge generation and the capacity to deal with uncertainty Our analysis revealed stark differences which were linked to pre-existing governing structures  the traditional role of academia  experience of crisis management and the communication of uncertainty-all of which impacted on how much people trusted their government  Germany leveraged diversity and inclusiveness  a  patchwork quilt   for which it was heavily criticised during the second wave  The Swedish approach avoided plurality and largely excluded academia  while in the UK s academia played an important role in knowledge generation and in forcing the government to review its strategies  However  the vivant debate left the public with confusing and rapidly changing public health messages  Uncertainty and the lack of evidence on how best to manage the COVID-19 pandemic-the main feature during the first wave-was only communicated explicitly in Germany  All country governments lost trust of their populations during the epidemic due to a mix of communication and transparency failures  and increased questioning of government legitimacy and technical capacity by the public,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872972
9342,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Blood donors are increasingly being recognized as an informative resource for surveillance  We aimed to review severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seroprevalence studies conducted among blood donors to investigate methodological biases and provide guidance for future research  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed and preprint publications between January 2020 and January 2021  Two reviewers used standardized forms to extract seroprevalence estimates and data on methodology pertaining to population sampling  periodicity  assay characteristics  and antibody kinetics  National data on cumulative incidence and social distancing policies were extracted from publicly available sources and summarized  RESULTS  Thirty-three studies representing 1 323 307 blood donations from 20 countries worldwide were included  sample sizes ranged from 22 to 953 926 donations   The majority of the studies  79   reported seroprevalence rates <10   ranging from 0  to 76   after adjusting for waning antibodies    Overall  less than 1 in 5 studies reported standardized seroprevalence rates to reflect the demographics of the general population  Stratification by age and sex were most common  64  of studies   followed by region  48    A total of 52  of studies reported seroprevalence at a single time point  Overall  27 unique assay combinations were identified  55  of studies used a single assay and only 39  adjusted seroprevalence rates for imperfect test characteristics  Among the nationally representative studies  case detection was most underrepresented in Kenya  1 1264   CONCLUSION  By the end of 2020  seroprevalence rates were far from reaching herd immunity  In addition to differences in community transmission and diverse public health policies  study designs and methodology were likely contributing factors to seroprevalence heterogeneity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862614
6558,BACKGROUND  The burden of road traffic crashes  RTCs  and road traffic fatalities  RTFs  has been increasing in low-income and middle-income countries  LMICs   Most RTCs and RTFs happen at night  Although few countries  including Zambia  have implemented night travel bans  there is no evidence on the extent to which such policies may reduce crashes and fatalities  METHODS  We exploit the quasi-experimental set up afforded by the banning of night travel of public service vehicles in Zambia in 2016 and interrupted time series analysis to assess whether the ban had an impact on both levels and trends in RTCs and RTFs  We use annual administrative data for the period 2006-2020  with 10 pre-intervention and 4 post-intervention data points  In an alternative specification  we restrict the analysis to the period 2012-2020 so that the number of data points are the same pre-interventions and post-interventions  We also carry out robustness checks to rule out other possible explanation of the results including COVID-19  RESULTS  The night travel ban was associated with a reduction in the level of RTCs by 4131 3  annual average RTCs before the policy 17 668  and a reduction in the annual trend in RTCs by 2485 5  These effects were significant at below 1   and they amount to an overall reduction in RTCs by 24   The policy was also associated with a 57 5  reduction in RTFs  In absolute terms  the trend in RTFs reduced by 477 5  Annual average RTFs before the policy 1124 7   which is significant at below 1  level  Our results were broadly unchanged in alternative specifications  CONCLUSION  We conclude that a night travel ban may be an effective way of reducing the burden of RTCs and RTFs in Zambia and other LMICs  However  complementary policies are needed to achieve more gains,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903564
4773,BACKGROUND  Biomolecular interactions that modulate biological processes occur mainly in cavities throughout the surface of biomolecular structures  In the data science era  structural biology has benefited from the increasing availability of biostructural data due to advances in structural determination and computational methods  In this scenario  data-intensive cavity analysis demands efficient scripting routines built on easily manipulated data structures  To fulfill this need  we developed pyKVFinder  a Python package to detect and characterize cavities in biomolecular structures for data science and automated pipelines  RESULTS  pyKVFinder efficiently detects cavities in biomolecular structures and computes their volume  area  depth and hydropathy  storing these cavity properties in NumPy arrays  Benefited from Python ecosystem interoperability and data structures  pyKVFinder can be integrated with third-party scientific packages and libraries for mathematical calculations  machine learning and 3D visualization in automated workflows  As proof of pyKVFinder s capabilities  we successfully identified and compared ADRP substrate-binding site of SARS-CoV-2 and a set of homologous proteins with pyKVFinder  showing its integrability with data science packages such as matplotlib  NGL Viewer  SciPy and Jupyter notebook  CONCLUSIONS  We introduce an efficient  highly versatile and easily integrable software for detecting and characterizing biomolecular cavities in data science applications and automated protocols  pyKVFinder facilitates biostructural data analysis with scripting routines in the Python ecosystem and can be building blocks for data science and drug design applications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930115
8384,Breakthrough infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in fully vaccinated individuals are receiving intense scrutiny because of their importance in determining how long restrictions to control virus transmission will need to remain in place in highly vaccinated populations as well as in determining the need for additional vaccine doses or changes to the vaccine formulations and or dosing intervals  Measurement of breakthrough infections is challenging outside of randomized  placebo-controlled  double-blind field trials  However  laboratory and observational studies are necessary to understand the impact of waning immunity  viral variants and other determinants of changing vaccine effectiveness against various levels of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  severity  Here  we describe the approaches being used to measure vaccine effectiveness and provide a synthesis of the burgeoning literature on the determinants of vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough rates  We argue that  rather than trying to tease apart the contributions of factors such as age  viral variants and time since vaccination  the rates of breakthrough infection are best seen as a consequence of the level of immunity at any moment in an individual  the variant to which that individual is exposed and the severity of disease being considered  We also address key open questions concerning the transition to endemicity  the potential need for altered vaccine formulations to track viral variants  the need to identify immune correlates of protection  and the public health challenges of using various tools to counter breakthrough infections  including boosters in an era of global vaccine shortages,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876702
8183,Infections with endoparasites  especially gastrointestinal helminths  are a common finding in client-owned dogs  The Community Practice section at the Ohio State University Veterinary Medical Center  OSU-VMC  follows Companion Animal Parasite Council  American Animal Hospital Association  and American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines for parasitology by recommending annual fecal analyses for dogs and prescribing year-round  broad-spectrum parasite preventatives  There is increasing interest in determining if parasite occurrence is changing in client-owned dogs  Therefore  a retrospective study was designed to examine risk factors associated with the detection of parasites in samples submitted to the OSU-VMC Clinical Veterinary Parasitology Diagnostic Laboratory  Of the 1198 canine fecal samples  254  21 2   of these samples had a positive fecal analysis for gastrointestinal  GI  parasites  The age of the dog  time of year  reproductive status  purpose of fecal examination  GI signs  and type of parasite preventatives were assessed as potential risk factors for GI parasite infection in dogs  To determine if Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19 -associated hospital restrictions impacted the number of fecal examinations performed  data from January to December 2020  was compared to the same period in 2019  There was nearly a 50  reduction in canine fecal samples submitted to the OSU-VMC Clinical Veterinary Parasitology Diagnostic Laboratory in March 2020 compared to March 2019  At least one canine GI parasite was found in over 20  of all 1198 canine fecal samples  21 2   254 1198   The most commonly detected canine GI parasite in all the fecal samples was hookworm at 9 6   115 1198   followed by Giardia sp  at 7 6   91 1198   Age  use of parasite preventatives  breed  and reproductive status were found to be associated with parasite occurrence in the dog samples  Identifying such risk factors in dogs will guide veterinarians to advise annual fecal examinations more strongly to clients with high-risk dogs or when routine health visits are postponed for an extended period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879959
2748,In the last two years  we have been struggling with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2  the virus causing COVID-19  Several cases of subacute thyroiditis  SAT  have already been described as directly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection  The clinical course of SAT induced by SARS-CoV-2 can be entirely different from the classic SAT course  and one of the most important differences is a very rapid SAT onset observed in some patients  especially a phenomenon of the simultaneous presence of both diseases  The aim of this report is to compare HLA profile and clinical course of SAT in four patients  in whom SAT was considered as triggered by COVID-19  with special attention paid to the differences between a patient with rare simultaneous presence of SAT and COVID-19  and patients with longer time lag between the diseases  The unusual phenomenon of simultaneous occurrence of COVID-19 and SAT induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection can be HLA-dependent and related to the presence of homozygosity at HLA-B 35  Additionally  the clinical course of SAT triggered by COVID-19 can be HLA-related in regard to the risk of recurrence  and to a variety of other aspects  including severity of thyrotoxicosis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960716
5968,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   besides causing human infection  has been shown to naturally infect several susceptible animal species including large cats  tigers  lions  pumas  spotted leopards   dogs  cats  ferrets  gorillas and minks  Cats and minks are continuing to be the most reported species with SARS-CoV-2 infections among animals but it needs to be investigated further  METHODS AND RESULTS  We report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a domestic cat that exhibited respiratory disease after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus from humans in the same household  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in two oropharyngeal swabs collected at two time points  11 days apart  the first  when the cat was reported to be sick and the second  before euthanasia due to poor prognosis  The viral nucleic acid detected at two time points showed no genomic variation and resembled the clade GH circulating in humans in the United States  Clinical and pathological findings noted in this 16-year-old cat were consistent with respiratory and cardiac insufficiency  CONCLUSIONS  SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was likely an incidental clinical finding  as the virus was not detected in fixed lungs  heart  or kidney tissues  Only fresh lung tissue collected at necropsy showed the presence of viral nucleic acid  albeit at a very low level  Further research is needed to clarify the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in companion animals of advanced age and underlying cardiac disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910368
100,Objective  Environmental tobacco smoke  ETS  exposure is associated with many diseases  including lower respiratory tract infections  in pediatric age groups  In this study  we aimed to assess the effect of household ETS exposure on symptom frequency and clinical severity in children and adolescents with COVID-19  Materials and Methods  This retrospective study included pediatric cases  <18 years old  with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test  who were admitted to our hospital between 20 03 2020 and 01 05 2020  Patients with respiratory diseases and active smokers were excluded  Demographic characteristics  symptoms  and clinical severity of COVID-19 were obtained from parents and children using a questionnaire and from patients  files  Household ETS exposure was assessed by questionnaire  Results  A total of 167 patients  median age 145 months  50 7   male  were included in the study  The frequency of household ETS exposure was 50 9   and the frequency of cough was significantly higher in exposed children than non-exposed children  71 4  vs 50 8  respectively  p 0 02   The frequency of both fever and cough was significantly higher ETS-exposed in the subgroup of cases with a mild clinical course  69 5  vs 48 1  respectively  p  0 02 for fever and 67 8  vs 44 4  respectively  p 0 01 for cough   There was no relationship between clinical severity and household ETS exposure  Conclusion  Household ETS exposure may impact COVID-19 pediatric cases as demonstrated by the increased frequency of cough and fever in ETS-exposed children  As new lockdown measures are implemented  increasing public awareness about the effect of household ETS exposure on COVID-19as well as encouraging a decrease in ETS exposure are essential,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005725
8417,BACKGROUND  Rooted phylogenetic networks are used to display complex evolutionary history involving so-called reticulation events  such as genetic recombination  Various methods have been developed to construct such networks  using for example a multiple sequence alignment or multiple phylogenetic trees as input data  Coronaviruses are known to recombine frequently  but rooted phylogenetic networks have not yet been used extensively to describe their evolutionary history  Here  we created a workflow to compare the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 with other SARS-like viruses using several rooted phylogenetic network inference algorithms  This workflow includes filtering noise from sets of phylogenetic trees by contracting edges based on branch length and bootstrap support  followed by resolution of multifurcations  We explored the running times of the network inference algorithms  the impact of filtering on the properties of the produced networks  and attempted to derive biological insights regarding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from them  RESULTS  The network inference algorithms are capable of constructing rooted phylogenetic networks for coronavirus data  although running-time limitations require restricting such datasets to a relatively small number of taxa  Filtering generally reduces the number of reticulations in the produced networks and increases their temporal consistency  Taxon bat-SL-CoVZC45 emerges as a major and structural source of discordance in the dataset  The tested algorithms often indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RaTG13 is a tree-like clade  with possibly some reticulate activity further back in their history  A smaller number of constructed networks posit SARS-CoV-2 as a possible recombinant  although this might be a methodological artefact arising from the interaction of bat-SL-CoVZC45 discordance and the optimization criteria used  CONCLUSION  Our results demonstrate that as part of a wider workflow and with careful attention paid to running time  rooted phylogenetic network algorithms are capable of producing plausible networks from coronavirus data  These networks partly corroborate existing theories about SARS-CoV-2  and partly produce new avenues for exploration regarding the location and significance of reticulate activity within the wider group of SARS-like viruses  Our workflow may serve as a model for pipelines in which phylogenetic network algorithms can be used to analyse different datasets and test different hypotheses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876022
5610,BACKGROUND  Recent literature suggests a bi-directional relationship between COVID-19 infection and diabetes mellitus  with an increasing number of previously normoglycemic adults with COVID-19 being admitted with new-onset diabetic ketoacidosis  DKA   However  the possibility of COVID-19 being a potential trigger for A-beta   ketosis-prone diabetes  KPD  in these patients needs elucidation  Our study aimed at analyzing such a cohort of patients and determining their natural course of beta-cell recovery on serial follow-up  METHODS  After initial screening  n   42 previously non-diabetic patients with new-onset DKA and RT-PCR positive COVID-19  were included in our ten-month follow-up study  Of these  n   22 were negative  suspected A-beta   KPD  and n   20 were positive  Type 1A DM  for autoantibodies  GAD IA-2 ZnT8   Subsequently  n   19 suspected KPD and n   18 Type 1A DM patients were followed-up over ten months with serial assessments of clinical  biochemical and beta-cell secretion  Amongst the former  n   15  79   patients achieved insulin independence  while n   4  21   continued to require insulin at ten-months follow-up  RESULTS  On comparison  the suspected KPD patients showed significantly greater BMI  age  Hba1c  IL-6 and worse DKA parameters at presentation  Serial C-peptide estimations demonstrated significant beta-cell recovery in KPD group  with complete recovery seen in the 15 patients who became insulin independent on follow-up  Younger age  lower BMI  initial severity of DKA and inflammation  IL-6 levels   along-with reduced 25-hydroxy-Vitamin-D levels were associated with poorer recovery of beta-cell secretion at ten-month follow-up amongst the KPD patients  CONCLUSIONS  This is the first prospective study to demonstrate progressive recovery of beta-cell secretion in new-onset A-beta   KPD provoked by COVID-19 infection in Indian adults  with a distinctly different profile from Type 1A DM  Given their significant potential for beta-cell recovery  meticulous follow-up involving C-peptide estimations can help guide treatment and avoid injudicious use of insulin,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916147
4284,BACKGROUND  Since the COVID-19 pandemic began  there have been concerns related to the preparedness of healthcare workers  HCWs   This study aimed to describe the level of awareness and preparedness of hospital HCWs at the time of the first wave  METHODS  This multinational  multicenter  cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital HCWs from February to May 2020  We used a hierarchical logistic regression multivariate analysis to adjust the influence of variables based on awareness and preparedness  We then used association rule mining to identify relationships between HCW confidence in handling suspected COVID-19 patients and prior COVID-19 case-management training  RESULTS  We surveyed 24 653 HCWs from 371 hospitals across 57 countries and received 17 302 responses from 70 2  HCWs overall  The median COVID-19 preparedness score was 11 0  interquartile range  IQR    6 0-14 0  and the median awareness score was 29 6  IQR   26 6-32 6   HCWs at COVID-19 designated facilities with previous outbreak experience  or HCWs who were trained for dealing with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak  had significantly higher levels of preparedness and awareness  p<0 001   Association rule mining suggests that nurses and doctors who had a  great-extent-of-confidence  in handling suspected COVID-19 patients had participated in COVID-19 training courses  Male participants  mean difference   0 34  95  CI   0 22  0 46  p<0 001  and nurses  mean difference   0 67  95  CI   0 53  0 81  p<0 001  had higher preparedness scores compared to women participants and doctors  INTERPRETATION  There was an unsurprising high level of awareness and preparedness among HCWs who participated in COVID-19 training courses  However  disparity existed along the lines of gender and type of HCW  It is unknown whether the difference in COVID-19 preparedness that we detected early in the pandemic may have translated into disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 burden of disease by gender or HCW type,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936646
1737,Objective  The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ECMO-supported sedative  analgesic  and muscle relaxants have changed  but there are insufficient data to determine the optimal dosing strategies for these agents  Sedation  analgesia and muscle relaxation therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2  SARS-CoV-2  receiving ECMO support are more specific and have not been fully reported  This study observed and evaluated the use of sedative and analgesic drugs and muscle relaxants in SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with VV-ECMO  Methods  This study was a single-center  retrospective and observational study  Our study includes 8 SARS-CoV-2 patients treated with VV-ECMO in an intensive care unit at Shanghai Public Health Center from February to June 2020  We collected the demographic data from these patients and the dose and course of sedation  analgesia  and muscle relaxants administered during ECMO treatment  Results  The doses of sedative  analgesic and muscle relaxant drugs used in patients with VV-ECMO were significant  Over time  the doses of drugs that were used were increased  and the course of muscle relaxant treatment was extended  Conclusion  Sedation  analgesia  and muscle relaxant use require individualized titration in patients with SARS-CoV-2 who have respiratory failure and who are receiving VV-ECMO,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977069
3616,The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted human lifestyles across the world  Lockdowns and home confinement decreased prior opportunities for everyday physical activity  To retrospectively assess how the Austrian population coped with these aspects of the crisis  we conducted a cross-sectional online survey from March to September 2021 using a structured questionnaire in German  In total  1214 participants  56 9  females  mean age 37 0 years  living across Austria shared self-reported information on sociodemographic characteristics  indoor and outdoor physical activity  reasons for being outdoors  and life satisfaction before and after the emergence of the virus  As a result  overall indoor physical activity significantly decreased in a before-during COVID-19 crisis comparison  although exercising at home with online instructions increased by about 63   Exercising outdoors increased overall  specifically in periurban forests and rural areas  both by about 9   Life satisfaction decreased significantly by 19 7   p < 0 001   Outdoor public places and natural environments gained importance due to restrictions affecting access to sport facilities  Further research is needed to evaluate benefits and therapeutic values of outdoor nature for physical and mental health in times of a global pandemic to maintain resilient societies  as it might impact future active living and life satisfaction,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948682
4513,BACKGROUND  Limited space and resources are potential obstacles to infection prevention and control  IPAC  measures in in-centre hemodialysis units  We aimed to assess IPAC measures implemented in Quebec s hemodialysis units during the spring of 2020  describe the characteristics of these units and document the cumulative infection rates during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  For this cross-sectional survey  we invited leaders from 54 hemodialysis units in Quebec to report information on the physical characteristics of the unit and their perceptions of crowdedness  which IPAC measures were implemented from Mar  1 to June 30  2020  and adherence to and feasibility of appropriate IPAC measures  Participating units were contacted again in March 2021 to collect information on the number of COVID-19 cases in order to derive the cumulative infection rate of each unit  RESULTS  Data were obtained from 38 of the 54 units contacted  70  response rate   which provided care to 4485 patients at the time of survey completion  Fourteen units  37   had implemented appropriate IPAC measures by 3 weeks after Mar  1  and all 38 units had implemented them by 6 weeks after  One-third of units were perceived as crowded  General measures  masks and screening questionnaires were used in more than 80  of units  and various distancing measures in 55 -71   reduction in dialysis frequency was rare  Data on cumulative infection rates were obtained from 27 units providing care to 4227 patients  The cumulative infection rate varied from 0  to 50   median 11 3   interquartile range 5 2 -20 2   and was higher than the reported cumulative infection rate in the corresponding region in 23  85   of the 27 units  INTERPRETATION  Rates of COVID-19 infection among hemodialysis recipients in Quebec were elevated compared to the general population during the first year of the pandemic  and although hemodialysis units throughout the province implemented appropriate IPAC measures rapidly in the spring of 2020  many units were crowded and could not maintain physical distancing  Future hemodialysis units should be designed to minimize airborne and droplet transmission of infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933881
8088,The remarkable flexibility and adaptability of both deep learning models and ensemble methods have led to the proliferation for their application in understanding many physical phenomena  Traditionally  these two techniques have largely been treated as independent methodologies in practical applications  This study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning framework wherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy  stability  scalability  and reproducibility  prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of dynamics  Unpredictability is considered one of the key features of chaotic dynamics  therefore  forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue in the scientific community  It becomes more challenging when the prediction of extreme events is the focus issue for us  In this circumstance  the proposed optimized ensemble deep learning  OEDL  model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks  reservoir computing  and long short-term memory can play a key role in advancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events  The combined framework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual deep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated and real-world data sets  We exhibit the outstanding performance of the OEDL framework for forecasting extreme events generated from a Lienard-type system  prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazil  dengue cases in San Juan  and sea surface temperature in the Nino 3 4 region,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881612
5424,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide  leading to an ongoing pandemic  In this article  we present an agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg  and use it to estimate the impact  on cases and deaths  of interventions including testing  contact tracing  lockdown  curfew and vaccination  Our model is based on collation  with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly  The model is highly heterogeneous  featuring spatial clustering  over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution  The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020  Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model  In particular  with R0   2 45  the SEIR model infects 87  of the resident population while our agent-based model infects only around 23  of the resident population  Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially  but are less effective at reducing deaths  Lockdowns are very effective although costly  while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small  When vaccinating against a future outbreak  our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low coverage  with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30  of the population fully immune  When vaccinating in the midst of an outbreak  the challenge is more difficult  In this context  we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy  capacity  hesitancy and strategy  We conclude that  short of a permanent lockdown  vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919576
2310,The Omicron variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has become widespread across the world in a flashing manner  As of December 7  2021  a total of 758 Omicron cases were confirmed in Denmark  Using the nucleotide sequences of the Delta and Omicron variants registered from Denmark in the GISAID database  we found that the effective  instantaneous  reproduction number of Omicron is 3 19  95 CI 2 82-3 61  times greater than that of Delta under the same epidemiological conditions  Proportion of Omicron infections among all SARS-CoV-2 infections in Denmark was expected exceed the 95  on December 28  2021 with a 95  CI from December 25 to December 31  2021  Given that the Delta variant or variants less transmissible than Delta are dominant in most countries  the rapid increase in Omicron in the virus population may be observed as soon as the Omicron is introduced  Preparing proactive control measures is vital  assuming the substantial advantage of the transmission by Omicron  This article is protected by copyright  All rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967453

6428,Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against COVID-19 spread  While the WHO and other stakeholders fear vaccine nationalism  vaccine-hesitancy has become a topical issue among experts  Based on the evidence of vaccine hesitancy among Blacks  we explore the interrelatedness of psycho-social factors  personal health engagement  fear of COVID-19  perceived susceptibility  and vaccine-related attitude  likely to thwart vaccine acceptance in Africa  We sampled 1768 Ghanaian adults over 2 weeks from December 14  2020  the first day a successful COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the US using an online survey  A higher level of personal health engagement was found to promote vaccine-related attitudes while reducing COVID-19 related fears  susceptibility  and vaccine hesitancy  Fear of COVID-19 and perceived vulnerability are significant contributors to the willingness to accept vaccination  This is an indication that health engagement alone will not promote vaccination willingness  but the fear and higher level of perceived susceptibility out of personal evaluation are essential factors in vaccination willingness  We recommend promoting health educational messages on COVID-19 vaccination ahead of any vaccination rollout in Africa  and such messages should contain some element of fear appeal,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905469
9346,A pathogen inactivation step during collection or processing of clinical samples has the potential to reduce infectious risks associated with diagnostic procedures  It is essential that these inactivation methods are demonstrated to be effective  particularly for non-traditional inactivation reagents or for commercial products where the chemical composition is undisclosed  This study assessed inactivation effectiveness of twenty-four next-generation  guanidine-free  nucleic acid extraction lysis buffers and twelve rapid antigen test buffers against SARS-CoV-2  the causative agent of COVID-19  These data have significant safety implications for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and support the design and evidence-based risk assessment of these procedures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862448
3473,Objectives  To determine the acceptability of an exercise programme and to identify barriers and facilitators to compliance with the programme from the participants  perspective  Methods  Patients aged 75 years or older were recruited within the first 36 hours of hospital admission  Participants were randomised to complete two strengthening-based  intervention arm  or stretching-based  control arm  exercise sessions per-day  At hospital discharge  participants were asked to take part in interviews with a member of the research team exploring the barriers and facilitators to adherence to the intervention  Results  15 participants  7 intervention arm  8 control arm  were recruited before the trial was stopped due to COVID-19  Both groups showed reductions in knee-extension strength  and improvements in functional mobility at discharge from hospital  A total of 23 60 intervention sessions were classed as  complete   12 60 as partially complete  and 25 60 were missed entirely  Eight participants took part in interviews  Intrinsic factors that impacted participation in the research  related to current health  health beliefs  and experience of multi-morbidity or functional decline  Staff had both a positive and negative effect on participant adherence to the intervention  Conclusions  The exercise intervention was well received  with most participants describing health benefits  though intervention fidelity was lower than expected,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950809
7144,Fear is a fundamental response in the face of a life-threatening pandemic  such as COVID-19  To assess COVID-19-related fear  the Fear of COVID-19 Scale  FCV-19S  has been recently developed and validated in many countries across the globe  The current study aimed to adapt the FCV-19S into German and to examine its psychometric properties  Participants  N   866  were asked to complete the FCV-19S  report their perceived risk of contracting the virus  and their willingness to comply with mask wearing  Confirmatory Factor Analysis supported both a two-factor structure  emotional and somatic fear  and a more parsimonious one-factor model  Among demographic variables  only female gender was positively associated with the FCV-19S  Moreover  the measure was associated with increased risk perception and compliance with mask wearing  Results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties in German and can be used in future work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898309
7816,As is well known  the COVID-19 infection is affecting the whole world  causing a serious health  social and economic crisis  The viral infection can cause a mild or severe illness  depending on how effectively the virus is countered by the immune system  In this context  the position of pregnant women remains rather unknown  The case described here reports the immune response in a woman in good health and in her newborn son  having undergone complete vaccination during the first trimester of her pregnancy  We performed a serological assay  measuring IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2  by a fully automated solid phase DELFIA  time-resolved fluorescence  immunoassay in a few drops of blood  collected by a finger-prick and spotted on filter paper  The dried blood spot  DBS  sample we used is the same type of sample routinely used in a newborn screening program test  Such a simple and minimally invasive approach allowed us to monitor both the mother and the newborn soon after birth for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels  The serological test on the DBS carried out on both mother and newborn revealed the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies up to 7 months after vaccination in the mother  and already at 48 h of life in the newborn,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886515
8471,BACKGROUND  The Seraph R 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter R  is a hemoperfusion device that is licensed for the reduction of pathogens  including several viruses  in the blood  It received Emergency Use Authorization  EUA  for the treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  by the FDA  Several studies have shown that the blood viral load of SARS-CoV-2 correlates with adverse outcomes and removal of the nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the Seraph R 100 has been recently demonstrated  The aim of this registry was to evaluate safety and efficacy of Seraph R 100 treatment for COVID-19 patients  METHODS  Twelve hospitals from six countries representing two continents documented patient and treatment characteristics as well as outcome parameters without reimbursement  Additionally  mortality and safety results of the device were reported  One hundred-and-two treatment sessions in 82 patients were documented in the registry  Four patients were excluded from mortality analysis due to incomplete outcome data  which were available in the other 78 patients  RESULTS  Overall  a 30-day mortality rate of 46 2  in the 78 patients with complete follow up was reported  Median treatment time was 5 00  4 00-13 42  h  and 43 1  of the treatments were performed as hemoperfusion only  Adverse events of the Seraph R 100 treatment were reported in 8 8  of the 102 treatments and represented premature end of treatment due to circuit failure  Patients that died were treated later in their ICU stay and onset of COVID symptoms  They also had higher ferritin levels  Multivariate Cox regression revealed that delayed Seraph R 100 treatment after ICU admission  >60 hours  as well as bacterial superinfection were associated with mortality  While average predicted mortality rate according to SOFA score in ICU patients was 56 7  the observed mortality was 50 7   In non-ICU patients 4C-Score average predicted a mortality rate of 38 0  while the observed mortality rate was 11 1  CONCLUSIONS  The treatment of COVID-19 patients with Seraph R 100 is well tolerated and the circuit failure rate was lower than previously reported for KRT in COVID-19 patients  Mortality corelated with late initiation of Seraph treatment after ICU admission and bacterial superinfection infection  Compared to predicted mortality according to 4C-Score and SOFA Score  mortality of Seraph R 100 treated patients reported in the registry was lower,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875087
7474,Nasopharyngeal swab is the most widely used diagnostic test for COVID-19 detection  However  enormous tests have posed a high risk of infection to medical professionals due to close contact with patients and substantial health burden  While automation of the nasopharyngeal swab is regarded as a potential solution to address these problems  the quantitative study of force for safe and effective control has not been widely performed yet  Hence  this study presents applied force during the standard nasopharyngeal swab sampling procedure using a handheld sensorized instrument  The sensorized instrument can simultaneously measure multi-axis forces and 6-DOF hand motion while allowing natural hand motion as is used in the standard swab sampling  To accurately measure force from the handheld instrument  the compensation of gravity bias is accomplished online while estimating the orientation of the hand with an embedded IMU sensor  As a result  the instrument can measure all three-axes forces by an error below 5 mN  A simulated test on a phantom model using the sensorized instrument shows that how the forces vary during the sampling sequences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891725

5563,Aims  We aimed to determine whether there has been a change in the number of suicides occurring in three Australian states overall  and in age and sex subgroups  since the COVID-19 pandemic began  and to see if certain risk factors for suicide have become more prominent as likely underlying contributing factors for suicide  Method  Using real-time data from three state-based suicide registers  we ran multiple unadjusted and adjusted interrupted time series analyses to see if trends in monthly suicide counts changed after the pandemic began and whether there had been an increase in suicides where relationship breakdown  financial stressors  unemployment and homelessness were recorded  Results  Compared with the period before COVID-19  during the COVID-19 period there was no change in the number of suicides overall  or in any stratum-specific estimates except one  The exception was an increase in the number of young males who died by suicide in the COVID-19 period  adjusted RR 1 89  95  CI 1 11-3 23    The unadjusted analysis showed significant differences in suicide in the context of unemployment and relationship breakdown during the COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period  Analysis showed an increase in the number of suicides occurring in the context of unemployment in the COVID-19 period  unadjusted RR 1 53  95  CI 1 18-1 96    In contrast  there was a decrease in the number of suicides occurring in the context of relationship breakdown in the COVID-19 period  unadjusted RR 0 82  95  CI 0 67-0 99    However  no significant changes were identified when the models were adjusted for possible over-dispersion  seasonality and non-linear trend  Conclusion  Although our analysis found no evidence of an overall increase in suicides after the pandemic began  the picture is complex  The identified increase in suicide in young men indicates that the impact of the pandemic is likely unevenly distributed across populations  The increase in suicides in the context of unemployment reinforces the vital need for mitigation measures during COVID-19  and for ongoing monitoring of suicide as the pandemic continues,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916981
7649,The objective of this paper is to review selected insights about the current economic research on the Bioeconomy and circular economy  with a particular focus for the role of primary sector  and to derive implications for organisation  evaluation and valuation practice in the context of the post-COVID era  A framework for the analysis of optimal level of circularity and related economic and evaluation concepts is developed for this purpose  We highlight how higher focus on circularity will increase the complexity of market relationships  contributing to flexibility  but also to uncertainty  The paper argues that these issues will become more important in the post-COVID era  due to the plea for increasing Bioeconomy resilience  New organisational concepts and models are hence needed  Evaluation  on the other hand  will need to be embedded even more in the decision-making processes  in spite of the increasing uncertainty and difficulties in evaluation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888583

5193,INTRODUCTION  The use of telemedicine has broadened as technology that both restores continuity of care during disruptions in healthcare delivery and routinely provides primary care alone or in combination with in-person care  During the Covid-19 outbreak  the use of telemedicine as a routine care modality further accelerated  METHODS  A review of scientific studies that used telemedicine to provide care from December 2019 to December 2020 is presented  From an initial set of 2 191 articles  36 studies are analyzed  Evidence is organized and evaluated according to the country of study  the clinical specialty  the technology platform used  and satisfaction and utilization outcomes  RESULTS  Thirty-one studies reported high patient satisfaction scores  Eight studies reported satisfaction from both providers and patients with no uniformly accepted assessment instrument  Eight studies conducted a descriptive analysis of telemedicine use and patient adoption patterns  Less than one-third of studies were controlled before after studies  Most studies were conducted in the USA followed by Europe  CONCLUSIONS  Reported satisfaction rates are high  consistent with previously documented research  whereas utilization rates increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period  Future work in developing standardized uniform assessment instruments  embedded with each telemedicine system  would increase versatility and agility in the assessment  boosting statistical power and the interpretation of results,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924067
5128,Prolonged periods of restrictions on people s freedom of movement during the first massive wave of the COVID-19 pandemic meant that most people engaged in all their daily activities at home  This suggested the need for the spatial features of the home and its occupants  perception of them to be investigated in terms of people s wellbeing  The present study was conducted on a large sample  N   1354  drawn from different Italian regions  It examined the relationship between the  objective  and  subjective  dimensions of the home  measured in terms of objective home crowding and satisfaction with the space at home  in relation to perceived stress and the perceived risk of COVID-19 infection during the lockdown  The results showed that perceived stress is influenced by objective home crowding through the mediation of satisfaction with the space at home  These associations were more pronounced in younger generations  The negative association between satisfaction with the space at home and perceived stress was higher  the lower the perceived COVID-19 risk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924673
6688,Background  Substance use has spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic  highlighting potential links between reactivity to pandemic-related stress and increases in substance use engagement  Leveraging population-level exposure to a novel environmental stressor  the current study investigated whether emotion reactivity measured prior to the pandemic predicts the degree to which COVID-related stress impacts future substance use during the pandemic  Methods  Participants included 240 socioeconomically diverse adults  M SDage 33 47 9 39 years old  who were recruited from communities disproportionately impacted by the pandemic  with COVID-19 positivity and unemployment rates higher than the national average  All participants completed a research study prior to the start of the pandemic  and 90 of those participants were randomly selected to complete a follow-up study approximately six months into the pandemic  Results  On average  the sample reported high levels of stressors that they attributed specifically to the COVID-19 pandemic  Results revealed that trait emotional reactivity moderated the impact of pandemic-inflicted stressors on future substance use  such that COVID-related stress exposure was associated with an increase in substance use for individuals who tend to experience negative emotions for prolonged periods of time  Limitations  Limitations of the study are that the data were collected in a fixed timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic and the exclusive use of self-report measures  Conclusions  The longitudinal design of the present study extends the current literature by highlighting the potential role of emotional reactivity in predicting substance use coping behaviors  Findings suggest that emotion reactivity may be a useful intervention target among individuals highly impacted by the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901917
9314,India successfully executed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020  which provided unique opportunities to analyze the second-largest populous country s anthropogenic footprint on its natural systems  India s first Ramsar site and the world s second-largest brackish water system Chilika lagoon experienced a substantial decline  64   in the total petroleum hydrocarbon  TPHC  level in water  which was attributed to the massive declines or  at times  an abrupt complete halt of motorized boat operations for fishing and tourism  Using the TPHC values during the lockdown period  our study recommends a TPHC baseline threshold of 2 02 mug L -1  and 0 91 mug g -1  for Chilika waters and sediment  respectively  These baseline values can be used to quantify oil pollution and to formulate policy and management action plans for Chilika lagoon as well as for other similar ecosystems by local environmental agencies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863069
9753,Sentiment analysis is a branch of natural language analytics that aims to correlate what is expressed which comes normally within unstructured format with what is believed and learnt  Several attempts have tried to address this gap  i e   Naive Bayes  RNN  LSTM  word embedding  etc    even though the deep learning models achieved high performance  their generative process remains a  black-box  and not fully disclosed due to the high dimensional feature and the non-deterministic weights assignment  Meanwhile  graphs are becoming more popular when modeling complex systems while being traceable and understood  Here  we reveal that a good trade-off transparency and efficiency could be achieved with a Deep Neural Network by exploring the Credit Assignment Paths theory  To this end  we propose a novel algorithm which alleviates the features  extraction mechanism and attributes an importance level of selected neurons by applying a deterministic edge node embeddings with attention scores on the input unit and backward path respectively  We experiment on the Twitter Health News dataset were the model has been extended to approach different approximations  tweet aspect and tweets  source levels  frequency  polarity subjectivity   it was also transparent and traceable  Moreover  results of comparing with four recent models on same data corpus for tweets analysis showed a rapid convergence with an overall accuracy of approximately 83  and 94  of correctly identified true positive sentiments  Therefore  weights can be ideally assigned to specific active features by following the proposed method  As opposite to other compared works  the inferred features are conditioned through the users  preferences  i e   frequency degree  and via the activation s derivatives  i e   reject feature if not scored   Future direction will address the inductive aspect of graph embeddings to include dynamic graph structures and expand the model resiliency by considering other datasets like SemEval task7  covid-19 tweets  etc,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855856
8910,The RGD motif in the Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  spike protein has been predicted to bind RGD-recognizing integrins  Recent studies have shown that the spike protein does  indeed  interact with alphaVbeta3 and alpha5beta1 integrins  both of which bind to RGD-containing ligands  However  computational studies have suggested that binding between the spike RGD motif and integrins is not favourable  even when unfolding occurs after conformational changes induced by binding to the canonical host entry receptor  angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   Furthermore  non-RGD-binding integrins  such as alphax  have been suggested to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  Other viral pathogens  such as rotaviruses  have been recorded to bind integrins in an RGD-independent manner to initiate host cell entry  Thus  in order to consider the potential for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to bind integrins independent of the RGD sequence  we investigate several factors related to the involvement of integrins in SARS-CoV-2 infection  First  we review changes in integrin expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify which integrins might be of interest  Then  all known non-RGD integrin-binding motifs are collected and mapped to the spike protein receptor-binding domain and analyzed for their 3D availability  Several integrin-binding motifs are shown to exhibit high sequence similarity with solvent accessible regions of the spike receptor-binding domain  Comparisons of these motifs with other betacoronavirus spike proteins  such as SARS-CoV and RaTG13  reveal that some have recently evolved while others are more conserved throughout phylogenetically similar betacoronaviruses  Interestingly  all of the potential integrin-binding motifs  including the RGD sequence  are conserved in one of the known pangolin coronavirus strains  Of note  the most recently recorded mutations in the spike protein receptor-binding domain were found outside of the putative integrin-binding sequences  although several mutations formed inside and close to one motif  in particular  may potentially enhance binding  These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may interact with integrins independent of the RGD sequence and may help further explain how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses can evolve to bind to integrins,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869067
7001,Mutual aid groups developed and mobilized in communities across the UK and globally at the outset of the pandemic in order to support vulnerable community members with practical assistance and emotional support  with some understanding their work in political terms  This study adopted a  social cure  lens to investigate the effects of group identification and group perceptions on anxiety and coping self-efficacy among members of UK Covid-19 mutual aid groups  Survey data were collected from self-identified members of these groups  N   844  during the initial period of  lockdown  restrictions in April - May 2020  Correlational analyses showed that identification with the mutual aid group was linked to more positive group perceptions and better self-reported psychological outcomes  Perceived group politicization showed the reverse pattern  Mixed support for the  social cure  model was evident  the effect of group identification on coping self-efficacy  but not anxiety  was serially mediated by perceived support and collective efficacy  Perceived group politicization was a significant moderator  seeming to amplify the indirect effect of group identification on coping self-efficacy via perceived support  Results are discussed in light of previous empirical work on the social cure and Covid-19 mutual aid groups  Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article s Community and Social Impact Statement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898965
6261,Using province-level establishments and employment data from the Korean Employment Insurance Database  this paper investigates how the regional spread of COVID-19 affects local businesses and unemployment by establishment size and industry  We find that the number of small establishments declines substantially after the COVID-19 pandemic through a decrease in new establishment creation and a surge in establishment closures  By contrast  large establishments are not affected significantly  Examining the numbers of unemployment benefits  UB  applicants  an indicator of unemployment  we find that the higher the rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases in a province  the higher the number of UB applicants  regardless of their previous workplace size  Our analysis of employment insurance subscribers further confirms that the regional spread of COVID-19 leads to a significant reduction in employment and job mobility in small establishments  Regarding industry heterogeneity in the COVID-19 effects  we find that local COVID-19 outbreaks affect local industries more through the reduction in establishment creation and new employment than through an increase in establishment closures  Industries that require face-to-face operations  such as lodging   restaurant  experience a substantial adverse impact in the early phase  and the impact also tends to last longer as COVID-19 situations prolong,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908585
7889,From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  attention was raised to protect vulnerable populations  including migrants and refugees  M R   with the claim to leave no one behind in the pandemic response  In particular  concern was expressed in M R s reception centres since several COVID-19 outbreaks had been observed in Europe  Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the Italian reception system in the first pandemic wave in terms of incidence and health outcomes  A national survey focusing on the lockdown period of early 2020 was performed among reception centre managers  The survey achieved reaching around 70  of reception facilities and hosts  A national cumulative incidence of 400 positive cases per 100 000 and a north-south geographical gradient were observed  Sixty-eight facilities out of the 5038 participating in the survey reported confirmed cases and few COVID-19 clusters were detected especially in accommodations with the highest facility saturation index  Positive migrants were hospitalised in 25 9  of cases and no COVID-19 related deaths were observed  The study highlighted a cumulative incidence of cases and a geographical distribution similar to that of the general resident population  showing a global COVID-19 resilience in the Italian reception system in the period of observation  well beyond the expectations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886106

4533,SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 triggers abnormalities in coagulation parameters that can contribute to thrombosis  The goals of this research were to determine the levels of fibrinogen  D-dimer and FDP in COVID-19 patients  Following a systematic study  among 1198 articles  35 studies were included in the meta-analysis of fibrinogen levels in both severe and non-severe groups  The funnel plot  Egger s regression asymmetry test  and Begg s test used to measure the bias of publications  All meta-analysis performed by comprehensive meta-analysis version 2  CMA2   The pooled findings of fibrinogen levels revealed a significant rise in fibrinogen levels in severe COVID-19 than non-severe patients with COVID-19  The D-dimer and FDP levels were significantly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients with COVID-19 were  The levels of fibrinogen  D-dimer  and FDP have increased significantly in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients  Although  levels of clotting parameters do not always correlate with the severity of disease  these findings showed the diagnostic importance for fibrinogen  D-dimer  and FDP in COVID-19  The presence of a continuous rise in serial measurements of fibrinogen  D-dimer  and FDP may predict that patients with COVID-19 may become critically ill,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933579
9001,This paper suggests that ATP release induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in the genesis of the major symptoms and complications of COVID-19  Infection of specific cells which contain the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor results in a loss of protection of the Mineralocorticoid Receptor  MR   Local activation by cortisol stimulates the release of ATP initially into the basolateral compartment and then by lysosomal exocytosis from the cell surface  This then acts on adjacent cells  In the nose ATP acts as a nociceptive stimulus which results in anosmia  It is suggested that a similar paracrine mechanism is responsible for the loss of taste  In the lung ATP release from type 2 alveolar cells produces the non-productive cough by acting on purinergic receptors on adjacent neuroepithelial cells and activating  via the vagus  the cough reflex  Infection of endothelial cells results in the exocytosis of WeibelPalade bodies  These contain the Von Willebrand Factor responsible for micro-clotting and angiopoietin-2 which increases vascular permeability and plays a key role in the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome  To test this hypothesis this paper reports proof of concept studies in which MR blockade using spironolactone and low dose dexamethasone  SpiDex  was given to PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients  In 80 patients with moderate to severe respiratory failure 40 were given SpiDex and 40 conventional treatment with high dose dexamethasone  HiDex   There was 1 death in the HiDex group and none in the SpiDex  As judged by clinical  biochemical and radiological parameters there were clear statistically significant benefits of SpiDex in comparison to HiDex  A further 20 outpatients with COVID-19 were given SpiDex  There was no control group and the aim was to demonstrate safety  No adverse effects were noted and no patient became hyperkalaemic  90  were asymptomatic at 10 days  The very positive results suggest that blockade of the MR can produce major benefit in COVID19 patients  Further larger controlled studies of inpatients and outpatients are required not only for SARS-CoV-2 infection per se but also to determine if this treatment affects the incidence of Long COVID,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867791

8381,While previous research highlights the benefits of social media in times of a pandemic  this research focuses on the potential dark side of social media use among Generation Z  Gen Z  in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown between March and May 2020  The study reveals that COVID-19 information overload through social media had a negative impact on Gen Z social media users  psychological well-being  Moreover  perceived information overload heightened both social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19  which  in turn  increased users  social media discontinuance intention  In addition  considering that social media is the predominant method of maintaining connectivity with others for Gen Z users during the lockdown  the fear of missing out  FoMO  buffered the impact of social media fatigue and fear of COVID-19 on Gen Z users  social media discontinuance intention  Our research adds a hitherto underexplored perspective to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people s mental health  We offer a series of practical suggestions for social media users  social media platform providers  and health officials  institutions  and organizations in the effective and sustainable use of social media during the global COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876758
8855,Purpose  Accurate classification of COVID-19 in chest radiographs is invaluable to hard-hit pandemic hot spots  Transfer learning techniques for images using well-known convolutional neural networks show promise in addressing this problem  These methods can significantly benefit from supplemental training on similar conditions  considering that there currently exists no widely available chest x-ray dataset on COVID-19  We evaluate whether targeted pretraining for similar tasks in radiography labeling improves classification performance in a sample radiograph dataset containing COVID-19 cases  Approach  We train a DenseNet121 to classify chest radiographs through six training schemes  Each training scheme is designed to incorporate cases from established datasets for general findings in chest radiography  CXR  and pneumonia  with a control scheme with no pretraining  The resulting six permutations are then trained and evaluated on a dataset of 1060 radiographs collected from 475 patients after March 2020  containing 801 images of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases  Results  Sequential training phases yielded substantial improvement in classification accuracy compared to a baseline of standard transfer learning with ImageNet parameters  The test set area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for COVID-19 classification improved from 0 757 in the control to 0 857 for the optimal training scheme in the available images  Conclusions  We achieve COVID-19 classification accuracies comparable to previous benchmarks of pneumonia classification  Deliberate sequential training  rather than pooling datasets  is critical in training effective COVID-19 classifiers within the limitations of early datasets  These findings bring clinical-grade classification through CXR within reach for more regions impacted by COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869785

1038,In 2020  the world gained dramatic experience of the development of the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic  COVID-19  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2  SARS-CoV-2   Recent researches notice an increasing prevalence of anxiety and circadian rhythm disorders during COVID-19 pandemic  The aim of the study was describing clinical features of circadian rhythm disorders and the level of anxiety in persons who have had COVID-19  We have conducted a cohort retrospective study that included 278 patients who were divided into 2 study groups according to medical history  group 1 includes patients with a history of COVID-19  group 2 consists of patients who did not have clinically confirmed COVID-19 and are therefore considered not to have had this disease  To objectify circadian rhythm disorders  they were verified in accordance with the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3  The level of anxiety was assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  The most common circadian rhythm disorders were sleep phase shifts  We found that COVID-19 in the anamnesis caused a greater predisposition of patients to the development of circadian rhythm disorders  in particular delayed sleep phase disorder  In addition  it was found that after COVID-19 patients have increased levels of both trait and state anxiety  In our study  it was the first time that relationships between post-COVID-19 anxiety and circadian rhythm disorders had been indicated  Circadian rhythm disorders are associated with increased trait and state anxiety  which may indicate additional ways to correct post-COVID mental disorders and their comorbidity with sleep disorders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988815
7521,Happiness levels often fluctuate from one day to the next  and an exogenous shock such as a pandemic can likely disrupt pre-existing happiness dynamics  This paper fits a Marko Switching Dynamic Regression Model  MSDR  to better understand the dynamic patterns of happiness levels before and during a pandemic  The estimated parameters from the MSDR model include each state s mean and duration  volatility and transition probabilities  Once these parameters have been estimated  we use the one-step method to predict the unobserved states  evolution over time  This gives us unique insights into the evolution of happiness  Furthermore  as maximising happiness is a policy priority  we determine the factors that can contribute to the probability of increasing happiness levels  We empirically test these models using New Zealand s daily happiness data for May 2019 -November 2020  The results show that New Zealand seems to have two regimes  an unhappy and happy regime  In 2019 the happy regime dominated  thus  the probability of being unhappy in the next time period  day  occurred less frequently  whereas the opposite is true for 2020  The higher frequency of time periods with a probability of being unhappy in 2020 mostly correspond to pandemic events  Lastly  we find the factors positively and significantly related to the probability of being happy after lockdown to be jobseeker support payments and international travel  On the other hand  lack of mobility is significantly and negatively related to the probability of being happy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890413

1220,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  rapidly spread across the world  killing more than 4 million individuals globally  with 240 million individuals being confirmed by laboratory tests  Among different therapeutic strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection  vaccines are the most promising approach for curbing the pandemic  They elicit an immune neutralizing response and thus offer protection against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   However  some questions regarding the safety of COVID-19 vaccines have been raised and based on sparse reports of severe systemic reactions after vaccination  Among these  evidences on the potential effect of vaccination on the acute rise in blood pressure have been recently accrued  Approved vaccines in Europe increase the endogenous synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins from a variety of cells  Once synthetized in the cells reached by the vaccine  the Spike proteins first assemble in the cytoplasm and then migrate to the cell surface to protrude with a native-like conformation  Spike proteins are recognized by the immune system which rapidly develops an immune response  Furthermore  the Spike proteins assembled in the cells which are eventually destroyed by the immune response circulate in the blood as free-floating forms  Free-floating Spike proteins may interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptors leading to internalization  degradation  and dysregulation of the catalytic activities of these receptors  The consequent loss of ACE2 receptor activity leads to a rapid drop in the generation of angiotensin1 7 resulting from inactivation of angiotensin II  The imbalance between angiotensin II  overactivity  and of angiotensin1 7  deficiency  might play a role in the genesis of acute elevation in blood pressure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985455
9731,The new coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  which causes the COVID-19 disease can lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   It poses a serious challenge to the health care system  especially intensive care  Neurological patients  usually of advanced age and with a myriad of comorbidities  are at particular risk through the impact of the new coronavirus on their condition and nutritional capacity  Stroke is a leader in morbidity and mortality data  with a focus on dysphagia and its complications due to COVID-19 disease and acute cerebrovascular accident  In the acute phase of stroke  30-50  of patients suffer from dysphagia  which still shows a prevalence of 10  six months later  Dysphagia results in decreased or insufficient fluid and nutrient uptake  supp-lemented by inactivity  leading to malnutrition and sarcopenia  which worsens overall condition  outcome  and rehabilitation efficiency  Screening and early detection of swallowing disorders is a fundamental issue in order to develop a personalized and timely-initiated nutritional therapy strategy  Nutritional therapy plays a key role in frequent intensive care due to COVID-19 disease  where it increases the chances of recovery and reduces the length of stay in the intensive care unit and mortality  This is especially true in critically ill patients requiring prolonged ventilation  In COVID-19 diagnosed patients  screening for dysphagia  bedside assessment  and instrumental examination  followed by swallowing rehabilitation  are of paramount importance  Stroke can also be a complication of the COVID-19 infection  Care for cerebrovascular patients has also adapted to the pandemic   triazination  has become systemic  and dysphagia screening for stroke patients and nutritional therapy adapted to it have also shed new light,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856087
7454,Segmentation of COVID-19 infection in the lung tissue and its quantification in individual lobes is pivotal to understanding the disease s effect  It helps to determine the disease progression and gauge the extent of medical support required  Automation of this process is challenging due to the lack of a standardized dataset with voxel-wise annotations of the lung field  lobes  and infections like ground-glass opacity  GGO  and consolidation  However  multiple datasets have been found to contain one or more classes of the required annotations  Typical deep learning-based solutions overcome such challenges by training neural networks under adversarial and multi-task constraints  We propose to train a convolutional neural network to solve the challenge while it learns from multiple data sources  each of which is annotated for only a few classes  We have experimentally verified our approach by training the model on three publicly available datasets and evaluating its ability to segment the lung field  lobes and COVID-19 infected regions  Additionally  eight scans that previously had annotations for infection and lung have been annotated for lobes  Our model quantifies infection per lobe in these scans with an average error of 4 5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892098
794,Confronted with an emerging infectious disease at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  the medical community faced concerns regarding the safety of autopsies on those who died of the disease  This attitude has changed  and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for understanding COVID-19  but the true risk of infection to autopsy staff is nevertheless still debated  To clarify the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment  PPE   swabs were taken at nine points in the PPE of one physician and one assistant after each of 11 full autopsies performed at four centers  Swabs were also obtained from three minimally invasive autopsies  MIAs  conducted at a fifth center  Lung bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls  and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR  In 9 of 11 full autopsies  PPE samples tested RNA positive through PCR  accounting for 41 of the 198 PPE samples taken  21    The main contaminated items of the PPE were gloves  64  positive   aprons  50  positive   and the tops of shoes  36  positive  while the fronts of safety goggles  for example  were positive in only 4 5  of the samples  and all the face masks were negative  In MIAs  viral RNA was observed in one sample from a glove but not in other swabs  Infectious virus isolation in cell culture was performed on RNA-positive swabs from the full autopsies  Of all the RNA-positive PPE samples  21  of the glove samples  taken in 3 of 11 full autopsies  tested positive for infectious virus  In conclusion  PPE was contaminated with viral RNA in 82  of autopsies  In 27  of autopsies  PPE was found to be contaminated even with infectious virus  representing a potential risk of infection to autopsy staff  Adequate PPE and hygiene measures  including appropriate waste deposition  are therefore essential to ensure a safe work environment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993593

655,BACKGROUND  With many states in the United States permitting dentists to administer the COVID-19 vaccine  there is much discussion about their scope of practice in relation to delivering other vaccines  METHODS  Survey questions were developed to assess dentists  awareness about their vaccine administration scope of practice and attitudes and barriers if choosing to incorporate vaccine delivery into their practice scope  The survey was deployed electronically to members of the American Dental Association Clinical Evaluators  ACE  Panel  N   989  on September 2  2021  and remained open for 2 weeks  Data were summarized descriptively in Qualtrics and SAS Version 9 4  RESULTS  Of the 330 ACE Panel members who responded to the survey  42  were not aware of which vaccines their state permits them to deliver  More than one-half  55   would be willing to administer influenza or COVID-19 vaccines in their practice setting  but at present only 2  of respondents administer vaccines  To overcome vaccine administration barriers  the top 3 resources respondents want access to are the following  training or education  financial support  and access to protocols  Of all the respondents  91  indicated the dental hygienist should be involved in certain capacities  CONCLUSIONS  Few dentists are administering vaccines  possibly owing to a number of challenges  Dental hygienists may play an integral role in the administration of vaccines in the dental clinic  but few dentists are educating their patients about vaccines  PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS  Although dentists wishing to administer vaccines in their practice may encounter barriers  support at the state  federal  and organizational levels could help them overcome these challenges,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996534
2766,As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread among human populations  genetic changes occur and accumulate in the circulating virus  Some of these genetic changes have caused amino acid mutations  including deletions  which may have a potential impact on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures  including vaccines  therapeutics  and diagnostics  Considerable efforts have been made to categorize the amino acid mutations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor binding domain  RBD  of the spike  S  protein  along with certain mutations in other regions within the S protein as specific variants  in an attempt to study the relationship between these mutations and the biological behavior of the virus  However  the currently used whole genome sequencing surveillance technologies can test only a small fraction of the positive specimens with high viral loads and often generate uncertainties in nucleic acid sequencing that needs additional verification for precision determination of mutations  This article introduces a generic protocol to routinely sequence a 437-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the ACE2 RBD and a 490-bp nested RT-PCR cDNA amplicon of the N-terminal domain  NTD  of the S gene for detection of the amino acid mutations needed for accurate determination of all variants of concern and variants of interest according to the definitions published by the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  This protocol was able to amplify both nucleic acid targets into cDNA amplicons to be used as templates for Sanger sequencing on all 16 clinical specimens that were positive for SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960655

7485,Distress  confusion  and anger are common responses to COVID-19  Statistics Canada created the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series  CPSS  to understand social issues and effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian labour force  LF   The evaluation of the health and health-related behaviours were done through surveys collected between April and July  Features are composed of 4600 participants and 62 questions  which include the General Anxiety Disorder  GAD -7 questionnaire  This work proposes the use of CPSS2 survey data characteristics to identify the level of anxiety within the Canadian population during early stages of COVID-19 and is validated with the use of GAD-7 questionnaire  Minimum redundancy maximum relevance  mRMR  is applied to select the top 20 features to represent user anxiety  During classification  decision tree  DT  and support vector machine  SVM  are used to test the separation of anxiety severity  Hierarchical classification was used which separated the anxiety severity labels into different test sets and classified accordingly  We employ SVM for binary classification with 10-fold cross validation to separate the labels of Minimal and Severe anxiety to achieve an overall accuracy of 94 77  -0 05   After analysis  a subset of the reduced feature set can be represented as pseudo passive  PP  data  which are passive sensors that can augment qualitative data  The accurate classification provides proxy on what gives rise to anxiety  as well as the ability to provide early interventions  Future works can implement passive sensors to augment PP data and further understand why people cope this way,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891608
2759,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  African Americans and males have elevated risks of infection  hospitalization  and death from SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other populations  We report immune responses and renal injury markers in African American male patients hospitalized for COVID-19  METHODS  This was a single-center  retrospective study of 56 COVID-19 infected hospitalized African American males 50  years of age selected from among non-intensive care unit  ICU  and ICU status patients  Demographics  hospitalization-related variables  and medical history were collected from electronic medical records  Plasma samples collected close to admission  <  2 days  were evaluated for cytokines and renal markers  results were compared to a control group  n   31  and related to COVID-19 in-hospital mortality  RESULTS  Among COVID-19 patients  eight  14 2   suffered in-hospital mortality  seven  23 3   in the ICU and one  3 8   among non-ICU patients  Interleukin  IL -18 and IL-33 were elevated at admission in COVID-19 patients in comparison with controls  IL-6  IL-18  MCP-1 CCL2  MIP-1alpha CCL3  IL-33  GST  and osteopontin were upregulated at admission in ICU patients in comparison with controls  In addition to clinical factors  MCP-1 and GST may provide incremental value for risk prediction of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality  CONCLUSIONS  Qualitatively similar inflammatory responses were observed in comparison to other populations reported in the literature  suggesting non-immunologic factors may account for outcome differences  Further  we provide initial evidence for cytokine and renal toxicity markers as prognostic factors for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality among African American males,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960684
9019,Introduction  Following a period of strict lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic  most countries introduced policies in which citizens were expected to avoid crowded places using common sense  as advised by the WHO  We argue that the ambiguity in the recommendation to  avoid crowded places  implicitly forces individuals to make a complex strategic decision  Methods  Using a Dutch representative sample of 1 048 participants  42  male  mean age 43 78years  SD 12 53   we examine the effect of context on the decision to visit a hypothetical recreational hotspot under the policy recommendation to  avoid crowded places   We randomize four levels of context on the crowdedness  on the streets   no context  low  medium  and high context   Subsequently  participants are asked to estimate the percentage of others going out in the same situation  Finally  we assess the impact of a selection of personal characteristics on the likelihood of visiting a crowded place  Results  Respondents are proportionally more likely to go in a low context and high context  compared to no context  diff 0 121  p<0 000  and diff 0 034  p<0 05  respectively  and middle context  diff 0 125  p<0 000  and diff 0 037  p<0 05  respectively   Low context information also decreases the expectation of others going out  -2 63   z 4 68  p<0 000   High context information increases the expected percentage of others going out  significant only for medium to high context  2 94   z 7 34  p<0 001   Furthermore  we show that education  age  and health and risk attitude are all predictive of the likelihood to visit a crowded place  notwithstanding the context  Discussion  Although there is a strong inclination to avoid crowded places during the COVID-19 pandemic  81    we find two context-driven exceptions  when people expect to avoid crowded spots  in the  low  context  i e   strategical decision-making  and when people expect others to go  social influence   The freedom provided by ambiguous public policy is implicitly asking more from the population than it initially seems   Use your common sense  is often the accompanied advice  but our results show that more and better information concerning the context is essential to enable us to make an optimal decision for ourselves  and for society,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867584

906,BACKGROUND  During the COVID-19 pandemic  the UK government implemented a series of guidelines  rules  and restrictions to change citizens  behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus  such as the promotion of face masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders  The success of such measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens  but compliance was not complete  Detailed research is required on the factors that aided or hindered compliance with these measures  METHODS  To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines  we used structural topic modelling  a text mining technique  to extract themes from over 26 000 free-text survey responses from 17 500 UK adults  collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020  RESULTS  The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to oneself and one s family and friends and to  a lesser extent  the general public  Also of importance were a desire to return to normality  the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends  and the ability to work from home  Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public  due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints   the need to provide or receive support from family and friends  social isolation  missing loved ones  and mental health impacts  perceiving the risks as low  social pressure to not comply  and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules  Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics  Notably  women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family  CONCLUSION  The results demonstrated an array of factors contributed to compliance with guidelines  Of particular policy importance  the results suggest that government communication that emphasizes the potential risks of the virus and provides simple  consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours as COVID-19 continues and for future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34991545
1795,Thrombotic events are well-recognized complications of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   The incidence of such complications is highly related to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia  Recent evidence suggests that the coagulopathy of COVID-19 may persist for some period even after the full recovery from pneumonia  We report the case of a 35-year-old man who presented with a 10-day history of fever and cough  His plain radiograph showed bilateral peripherally located opacities suggestive of COVID-19  The diagnosis was confirmed by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   He was placed on a non-invasive ventilator but it failed to maintain normal oxygen saturation  Hence  the decision for intubation was made  He was extubated after 10 days in the ICU  The patient had a complete recovery  One week after discharge  the patient presented with severe abdominal pain that was out of proportion to the physical examination findings  He had an abdominal CT scan  which demonstrated a large thrombus occluding the superior mesenteric artery  There was no bowel dilatation or focal mural thickening to suggest bowel ischemia  The patient was resuscitated with intravenous fluid hydration  Opioid analgesics were administered to control the pain  After stabilizing the patient  he underwent laparotomy with thrombectomy  The patient tolerated the operation with no complications and had an uneventful recovery  The patient was discharged in good condition with no active issues after four days of hospitalization  The superior mesenteric thrombosis is an unusual complication of COVID-19 pneumonia  This case provides further evidence on the possibility of thrombotic events following the recovery from COVID-19  There is a pressing need for future studies to investigate the role of prophylactic antithrombotic and anticoagulants in patients who recovered from severe COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976537
8743,Translational science seeks to accelerate the multi-step process by which scientific discoveries are transformed into therapies that can improve the health of individuals and their communities  To facilitate crossing the traditional boundaries between basic and clinical research for instance  a systematic understanding of the scientific and operational principles that underlie each step of the translational cycle is developed to identify and address barriers to translation  Skills required by translational scientists  such as being systems thinkers and process innovators  overlap with those of anesthesiologists  and therefore  it is no surprise that anesthesiologists have contributed to this field  Indeed  the safety and efficacy of anesthesia care has greatly evolved over many decades because anesthesiologists have recognized the importance of readily incorporating physiological and pharmacological basic research findings into clinical practice  This article highlights the characteristics that make anesthesiologists well suited to be translational scientists  We also discuss one example of anesthesiology contributing to the field of translational science during the COVID-19 pandemic  We show that anesthesiologists  regardless of their specific clinical or research interests  have the skill set to become effective and critical players in the field of translational science and emphasize the importance of continued leadership in this field to academic anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870632
4248,COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO in 2020  Although it is a respiratory virus  ocular complications and manifestations of the infection have been reported in different forms  We report a case of transient myopia and narrow angles due to choroidal effusion following infection by the SARS-COV-2 virus  We propose that the ability of the virus to incite an inflammatory response in the host body may be the mechanism behind the disease entity  This is a novel  previously undocumented ocular complication in case of a COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937267
9765,AIM  To assess the sensitivity and potential utility of five RATs and the IDNow  Liat and Oxsed nucleic acid amplification tests  NAATs  in our population  METHOD  39 retrospective and contrived SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were tested in parallel by standard RT-PCR and RAT  A second group of 44 samples was tested by standard RT-PCR  rapid RT-PCR and two isothermal NAAT assays  Limit of detection was compared at RT-PCR cycle thresholds for all assays  RESULTS  We found that the Cobas Liat RT-PCR had 100  concordance with conventional RT-PCR  whereas the sensitivity of other rapid NAAT assays was less at lower viral loads indicated by Cts >30  p 0 042  and the RATs at Cts >25  p<0 001   When applied to New Zealand testing scenarios  IDNow or Oxsed NAAT could miss up to 12  and RATs up to 44 3  of COVID-19 cases compared with the RT-PCR currently used at our laboratory  CONCLUSION  We found that the POC Cobas Liat  a platform that delivers a sample answer in 20 minutes  demonstrated equivalent performance to standard RT-PCR  However  the RATs and isothermal NAAT assays demonstrated reduced sensitivity  limiting their utility in New Zealand s currently very low prevalence setting,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855731
9733,Since early 2020  scientists have strived to find an effective solution to fight SARS-CoV-2  especially by developing reliable vaccines that inhibit the spread of the disease and repurposing drugs for combatting its effects on the human body  The antiviral prodrug Remdesivir is still the most widely used therapeutic during the early stage of the infection  However  the current synthetic routes rely on the use of protecting groups  air-sensitive reagents  and cryogenic conditions  impeding the cost-efficient supply to patients  We therefore focused on the development of a straightforward  direct addition of  hetero arenes to unprotected sugars  Here we report a silylium-catalyzed and completely stereoselective C -glycosylation that initially yields the open-chain polyols  which can be selectively cyclized to provide either the kinetic alpha-furanose or the thermodynamically favored beta-anomer  The method significantly expedites the synthesis of Remdesivir precursor GS-441524 after subsequent Mn-catalyzed C-H oxidation and deoxycyanation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856043
3325,Non-compliance with social distancing  SD  measures clearly has negative effects on both public health and post-pandemic economic recovery  However  little is as yet known about people s views on and factors influencing their behavioral intentions toward SD measures  This study draws on moral disengagement theory and the norm-activation model to investigate mechanisms that promote or hinder compliance with SD measures  A longitudinal research approach was adopted to compare changes in the main factors over three periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in England  UK   The results reveal significant differences between the three periods regarding intentions to comply with SD measures  altruistic value  moral obligation and moral disengagement  with no significant change in ascription of responsibility  Residents showed the strongest intentions to comply with SD measures during the first national lockdown  with the highest moral obligation and lowest moral disengagement levels  compared with the lowest intention to comply during the first re-opening period  Altruistic value is important in promoting moral obligation and compliance with SD measures  whereas the predictive powers of ascription of responsibility and moral disengagement were weaker than expected  These findings offer guidance to policymakers and researchers in developing more effective policies and public communication strategies  The results suggest that communication is key to normalizing SD compliance  which can be achieved most effectively by fostering residents  altruistic value and moral considerations  Particular attention must be paid to re-opening periods between lockdowns  with clear messages to remind residents of prosocial aspects of SD compliance and public health  In addition to appropriate communication and education  technologies such as apps  QR codes and contactless shopping settings may also be used to facilitate compliance with SD measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953882
7772,IntroductionThe SARS-CoV-2 lineages carrying the amino acid change D614G have become the dominant variants in the global COVID-19 pandemic  By June 2021  all the emerging variants of concern carried the D614G mutation  The rapid spread of the G614 mutant suggests that it may have a transmission advantage over the D614 wildtype AimOur objective was to estimate the transmission advantage of D614G by integrating phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis MethodsWe assume that the mutation D614G was the only site of interest which characterised the two cocirculating virus strains by June 2020  but their differential transmissibility might be attributable to a combination of D614G and other mutations  We define the fitness of G614 as the ratio of the basic reproduction number of the strain with G614 to the strain with D614 and applied an epidemiological framework for fitness inference to analyse SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and sequence data ResultsUsing this framework  we estimated that the G614 mutant is 31   95  credible interval  28-34  more transmissible than the D614 wildtype  Therefore  interventions that were previously effective in containing or mitigating the D614 wildtype  e g  in China  Vietnam and Thailand  may be less effective against the G614 mutant ConclusionOur framework can be readily integrated into current SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to monitor the emergence and fitness of mutant strains such that pandemic surveillance  disease control and development of treatment and vaccines can be adjusted dynamically,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886945

245,Infection with the novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  results in pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms as well as pathologies at diverse anatomical sites  An outstanding question is whether these diverse pathologies are due to replication of the virus in these anatomical compartments and how and when the virus reaches those sites  To answer these outstanding questions and study the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection a method for tracking viral spread in vivo is needed  We developed a novel  fluorescently labeled  antibody-based in vivo probe system using the anti-spike monoclonal antibody CR3022 and demonstrated that it could successfully identify sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque model of COVID-19  Our results showed that the fluorescent signal from our antibody-based probe could differentiate whole lungs of macaques infected for 9 days from those infected for 2 or 3 days  Additionally  the probe signal corroborated the frequency and density of infected cells in individual tissue blocks from infected macaques  These results provide proof of concept for the use of in vivo antibody-based probes to study SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in rhesus macaques,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003140
1330,Evidence from multiple scientific studies suggests that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin  BCG  vaccine  widely used worldwide as a preventive measure against tuberculosis  also offers cross-protection against other pathogens  This review aimed to gather data from research that studied the mechanisms involved in the immunological protection induced by the BCG vaccine  which may be important in the control of viral infections  such as COVID-19  Through a literature review  we compiled information about the different BCG strains used worldwide  as well as the responses and protection elicited by them  We commented on the mechanisms of immune response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and we discussed the possibility of cross-protection of different BCG strains on the control of COVID-19  Due to the immunomodulatory properties of BCG  some BCG strains were able to induce an effective cellular immune response and  through epigenetic modifications  activate cells of the innate immune system  such as monocytes  macrophages and natural killer cells  which are crucial for the control of viral infections  Although several vaccines have already been developed and used in an attempt to control the COVID-19 pandemic  some BCG vaccine strains may help stimulate the basal defences against these pathogens and can be used as additional defences in this and future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983348
3768,A newly emerged respiratory viral disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  is also known as pandemic coronavirus disease  COVID-19   This pandemic has resulted an unprecedented global health crisis and devastating impact on several sectors of human lives and economies  Fortunately  the average case fatality ratio for SARS-CoV-2 is below 2   much lower than that estimated for MERS  34   and SARS  11    However  COVID-19 has a much higher transmissibility rate  as evident from the constant increase in the count of infections worldwide  This article explores the reasons behind how COVID-19 was able to cause a global pandemic crisis  The current outbreak scenario and causes of rapid global spread are examined using recent developments in the literature  epidemiological features relevant to public health awareness  and critical perspective of risk assessment and mitigation strategies  Effective pandemic risk mitigation measures have been established and amended against COVID-19 diseases  but there is still much scope for upgrading execution and coordination among authorities in terms of organizational leadership s commitment and diverse range of safety measures  including administrative control measures  engineering control measures  and personal protective equipment  PPE   The significance of containment interventions against the COVID-19 pandemic is now well established  however  there is a need for its effective execution across the globe  and for the improvement of the performance of risk mitigation practices and suppression of future pandemic crises,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945715
8688,The lungs are the main site that is affected in severe COVID-19  and post-mortem lung tissue provides crucial insights into the pathophysiology of severe disease  From basic histology to state-of-the-art multiparameter digital pathology technologies  post-mortem lung tissue provides snapshots of tissue architecture  and resident and inflammatory cell phenotypes and composition at the time of death  Contrary to early assumptions that COVID-19 in the lungs is a uniform disease  post-mortem findings have established a high degree of disease heterogeneity  Classic diffuse alveolar damage represents just one phenotype  with disease divisible by early and late progression as well as by pathophysiological process  A distinct lung tissue state occurs with secondary infection  extrapulmonary causes of death might also originate from a pathological process in the lungs linked to microthrombosis  This heterogeneity of COVID-19 lung disease must be recognised in the management of patients and in the development of novel treatment strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871544
178,Malaria  a disease caused by the protozoan parasites Plasmodium spp   is still causing serious problems in endemic regions in the world  Although the WHO recommends artemisinin combination therapies for the treatment of malaria patients  the emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites has become a serious issue and underscores the need for the development of new antimalarial drugs  On the other hand  new and re-emergences of infectious diseases  such as the influenza pandemic  Ebola virus disease  and COVID-19  are urging the world to develop effective chemotherapeutic agents against the causative viruses  which are not achieved to the desired level yet  In this review article  we describe existing drugs which are active against both Plasmodium spp  and microorganisms including viruses  bacteria  and fungi  We also focus on the current knowledge about the mechanism of actions of these drugs  Our major aims of this article are to describe examples of drugs that kill both Plasmodium parasites and other microbes and to provide valuable information to help find new ideas for developing novel drugs  rather than merely augmenting already existing drug repurposing efforts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004357

8803,Remdesivir  a monophosphate prodrug of nucleoside analog GS-441524  is widely used for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19  It has been suggested to use GS-441524 instead of remdesivir in the clinic and in new inhalation formulations  Thus  we compared the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of remdesivir and GS-441524 in Vero E6  Vero CCL-81  Calu-3  Caco-2 cells  and anti-HCoV-OC43 activity in Huh-7 cells  We also compared the cellular pharmacology of these two compounds in Vero E6  Vero CCL-81  Calu-3  Caco-2  Huh-7  293T  BHK-21  3T3 and human airway epithelial  HAE  cells  Overall  remdesivir exhibited greater potency and superior intracellular metabolism than GS-441524 except in Vero E6 and Vero CCL-81 cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870151
6252,Early in the COVID-19 pandemic  people living in cities were much more likely than rural residents to become infected with and die from the virus  Beginning in the summer of 2020  however  the proportional increase in virus spread became much greater in rural areas  By March 2021  per capita cases and deaths were greater in nonmetro than in metro areas  Multi-variate regression analysis found that political views were the most important variable explaining per capita COVID-19 cases  while measures of disadvantage were the best predictors of COVID-19 deaths  Counties with high proportions of Trump voters had higher per capita cases  and in nonmetro areas  these counties had higher death rates  Overall  the best predictor of COVID-19 death rates is low levels of educational attainment  high poverty rates  and high minority populations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908598
1916,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE  The Covid-19 pandemic continues challenging health systems globally  exposing healthcare workers to constant physical and psychological stressors  To date  several studies have already shown the catastrophic impact on the mental health of medical personnel during the early period of the pandemic  Nevertheless  literature evidences the dearth of works that evaluate the effect over time  understanding the pandemic as a sustained extreme stressor  The present study examines the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers at six months follow-up  MATERIAL AND METHODS  A total of 141 frontline healthcare workers from two tertiary hospitals were recruited between July and November 2020  Healthcare workers were evaluated psychologically at baseline and six months follow-up  January to May 2021  using psychometric tests for the assessment of acute stress  VASS  PSS-10  PCL-5   anxiety  STAI  and depression  PHQ-2  RESULTS  Overall  there was a general worsening of the mental health between the two psychological assessments  especially regarding depression and predisposition to perceiving the situations as a threat  Nurses and nurse aides showed poorer mental health while physicians improved over time  Reduced working hours and higher physical exercise resulted in better mental health among healthcare workers  Women and nursing staff were the most affected by psychological distress at baseline and six months follow-up  CONCLUSION  Reduced working hours  adequate resting periods  physical exercise  and efficient intervention strategies are of utmost importance in preventing  controlling  and reducing psychological distress among healthcare workers when coping with critical scenarios such as the current pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974883
3609,Novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has had a great impact on global production and life in the past period  Countless researchers devoted themselves to rescuing patients and reducing its impact  Analyzing the literature published during the pandemic and identifying the research priorities is of great significance to quickly discover research gaps  rationally allocate scientific research resources  and promote the development of the global research platform  To understand the swing of research priorities during the pandemic  this paper proposed a research priorities identification framework for pandemic based on scientific literature text analysis  Moreover  a research priority metric model was proposed to measure the characteristics of research priorities  and the empirical analysis from COVID-19 scientific literature was conducted to identify the research priorities during the pandemic  As a result  the research priorities identified by the method proposed in this paper discovered the fine-grained dynamic characteristics along with the process in the pandemic outbreak  and based on this  the emergency scientific research response strategies were discussed to give implications for the public health emergency scientific research and management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948715
5937,INTRODUCTION  Worldwide  children with disabilities are a vulnerable population and at high risk for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality  There is little information on the impact that COVID-19 had on children with disabilities and their families  particularly in low-income settings  This assessment describes the extent to which the pandemic impacted seven indicators of well-being in three low-income communities in Lusaka  Zambia  METHODS  Interviews were conducted with a random selection of families participating in an existing program  n   39   community health workers  n   6   healthcare workers  n   7  and government officials  n   2   Descriptive data was summarized and qualitative responses reviewed for themes  RESULTS  Most families reported a major loss of income resulting in food insecurity  79    housing instability  67    stress  36    and increased risk of child separation and neglect  18    Most families did not report receiving governmental financial assistance and reported loss of access to health services for their child such as physiotherapy  33    Stakeholders interviewed reported that COVID-19 information was widely available although few specific interventions for children  Families were seen to have greater food insecurity  more poverty  more crowding  less healthcare services and children left alone or on the streets to beg  DISCUSSION  COVID-19 and related containment measures have impacted the lives of children with disabilities and their families to a great extent  There is an urgent need for disability-inclusive responses that deliberately address the needs of children with disabilities and their families  notably uninterrupted access to adequate food  inclusive education  rehabilitation therapy  and income-generating activities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910762
8532,BACKGROUND  The coronavirus disease 2019  or COVID-19  has had a major psychological impact on healthcare workers  However  very few scales are available to specifically assess work-related stress and anxiety in healthcare workers responding to a viral epidemic  This study developed a new assessment tool  the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9  SAVE-9  and aimed to validate it among healthcare workers directly affected by COVID-19 in Korea  METHODS  A total of 1 019 healthcare workers responded through anonymous questionnaires during April 20-30  2020  Exploratory factor analysis  EFA  was conducted to explore the construct validity  and the reliability was assessed using internal consistency measures of Cronbach s alpha coefficients  Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to define the most appropriate cut-off point of SAVE-9 using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale  GAD-7  >   5   Second  Spearman s rank correlation coefficient was used to establish convergent validity for the SAVE-9 questionnaire with GAD-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9  RESULTS  The nine-item scale had satisfactory internal consistency  Cronbach s alpha   0 795   It adopted a two-factor structure  1  anxiety regarding viral epidemics and 2  work-related stress associated with viral epidemics  A cut-off score of 22 for the SAVE-9 ascertained levels of stress and anxiety in response to a viral epidemic in healthcare workers that warranted clinical attention  Correlations between the SAVE-9 and the other scales were statistically significant  P < 0 05   CONCLUSION  The results suggest that the SAVE-9 is a useful  reliable  and valid tool to evaluate stress and anxiety responses in healthcare workers during viral epidemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873885
4622,BACKGROUND  The digital transformation in health care has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic  Video consultation has become the alternative for hospital consultation  It remains unknown how to select patients suitable for video consultation  OBJECTIVE  This study aimed to develop a tool based on patient-reported outcomes  PROs  to triage total hip arthroplasty  THA  patients to hospital or video consultation  METHODS  A pilot study with expert panels and a retrospective cohort with prospectively collected data from 1228 THA patients was executed  The primary outcome was a PRO triage tool to allocate THA patients to hospital or video consultation 6 weeks postoperatively  Expert panels defined the criteria and selected the patient-reported outcome measure  PROM  questions including thresholds  Data were divided into training and test cohorts  Distribution  floor effect  correlation  responsiveness  PRO patient journey  and homogeneity of the selected questions were investigated in the training cohort  The test cohort was used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final triage tool  RESULTS  The expert panels selected moderate or severe pain and using 2 crutches as the triage tool criteria  PROM questions included in the final triage tool were numeric rating scale  NRS  pain during activity  3-level version of the EuroQol 5 dimensions  EQ-5D-3L  questions 1 and 4  and Oxford Hip Score  OHS  questions 6  8  and 12  Of the training cohort  201  201 703  28 6   patients needed a hospital consultation  which was statistically equal to the 150  150 463  32 4   patients in the test cohort who needed a hospital consultation  P  19   CONCLUSIONS  A PRO triage tool based on moderate or severe pain and using 2 crutches was developed  Around 70  of THA patients could safely have a video consultation  and 30  needed a hospital consultation 6 weeks postoperatively  This tool is promising for selecting patients for video consultation while using an existing PROM infrastructure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931989

7021,This study presents a quasi-experimental longitudinal mixed-methods research about the participation in leisure activities  physical activity  and games  as part of the family leisure programme   Lunae Magic School   for Spanish families with children under 12 years old during COVID-19 lockdown  The impact on parents and their perception of the psychological well-being of their children is evaluated  The results show that leisure activities reduce the parent s anxiety levels measured with STAI scale  p    0001  and their perception of the physical and emotional discomfort of their children  measured with PSC scale  p <  0001   It is qualitatively argued that despite the confinement situation  the gamification  the variety of activities and the fact of being able to enjoy quality time with the family have allowed the creation of spaces of fun and flow  Therefore  although the findings on the importance of family leisure were encouraging  more research is needed on the implementation of similar programmes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898857
3035,Thromboembolic complications are frequently observed in Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   While COVID-19 is linked to platelet dysregulation  the association between disease outcome and platelet function is less clear  We prospectively monitored platelet activation and reactivity in 97 patients during the first week of hospitalization and determined plasma markers of platelet degranulation and inflammation  Adverse outcome in COVID-19 was associated with increased basal platelet activation and diminished platelet responses  which aggravated over time  Especially GPIIb IIIa responses were abrogated  pointing toward impeded platelet aggregation  Moreover  platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation was diminished  pointing toward abrogated platelet-mediated immune responses in COVID-19  No general increase in plasma levels of platelet-derived granule components could be detected  arguing against platelet exhaustion  However  studies on platelets from healthy donors showed that plasma components in COVID-19 patients with unfavorable outcome were at least partly responsible for diminished platelet responses  Taken together this study shows that unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 is associated with a hypo-responsive platelet phenotype that aggravates with disease progression and may impact platelet-mediated immunoregulation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957266
8678,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  spreads all over the world and brings great harm to humans in many countries  Many new SARS-CoV-2 variants appeared during its transmission  In the present study  the Delta variants  B 1 617 2  of SARS-CoV-2  which have appeared in many countries  were considered for analysis  In order to evaluate the evolutionary divergence of the Delta variants B 1 617 2   the codon usage divergence in Delta variants  B 1 617 2  of SARS-CoV-2 was compared to that of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes emerged before June 2020  All Delta variants  B 1 617 2  and 350 early genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the NCBI database were downloaded  Codon usage pattern including the basic composition  the GC ratio of the third position  GC3  and the first two positions  GC12  in codons  overall GC contents  the effective number of codons  ENC   the codon bias index  CBI   the relative synonymous codon usage  RSCU  values  etc   of all concerned important gene sequences were all calculated  Codon usage divergence of them was calculated via summing their standard deviations  The results suggested that base compositions in both Delta variants  B 1 617 2  of SARS-CoV-2 and the early SARS-CoV-2 genomes were similar to each other  However  the internal codon usage divergence for most genes in Delta variants  B 1 617 2  was significantly wider than that of SARS-CoV-2  The RSCU values were further used to explore the synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in the sequences of the Delta variants  B 1 617 2   and the results showed the synonymous mutations are more obvious than the non-synonymous in the concerned sequences  The related codon usage divergence analysis is helpful for further study on the adaptability and disease prognosis of the SARS-CoV-2 variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871776
6605,Although continuing to utilize health services remains a key determinant of health  the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and engagement with health services among people with diabetes  PWD  remains unknown  This cross-sectional online survey examined factors associated with PWD s engagement with health services among 205 Israeli PWD during the subsiding of the first COVID-19 wave in Israel  Participants completed measures of perceived diabetes status  perceived risk  emotional reactions toward COVID-19  sense of mastery  engagement with health services  fear of contracting the virus in health services  canceling a medical appointment   and socio-demographic questionnaires  Most participants were women  their mean age was 40 18 years  and mean years since diagnosis was 15 70  Participants were recruited mainly via diabetes internet forums  Logistic and multiple hierarchical regressions were calculated  The odds of canceling appointment were higher for younger participants and for participants experiencing greater negative emotional reactions  Higher fear of contracting the virus in health services was related to higher perceived risk and experiencing greater negative emotional reactions  Findings suggest that in order to encourage PWD to utilize health services during a virus outbreak  clinical interventions should address PWD s perceived risk of contracting the virus and their emotional reactions toward COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903125

2995,The increase in women s drinking is one of the most prominent trends in alcohol consumption in the UK in recent history  possibly exacerbated by COVID-19 lockdown measures  Higher rates of drinking are associated with substantial economic  health  and social costs  However  women are less likely to seek treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder  AUD  than men and have less successful treatment outcomes from traditional treatment paths  such as 12-step programs and in-patient care  Female heavy drinkers may also experience particular forms of gendered stigma that affect their experiences of addiction and recovery and their desire or ability to access these more  traditional  services  This review provides an overview of existing qualitative and quantitative research regarding online sobriety communities that are predominantly utilised by women  such as non-12-step alcohol online support groups  AOSGs  and temporary abstinence initiatives  TAIs   This is a small-but expanding-body of literature emerging as  sober curiosity  and  mindful drinking  are trending in Western contexts such as the UK  particularly amongst young women who do not identify with traditional  binary recovery language such as  alcoholic  and  addict   This review highlights the gaps in research and concludes that further research regarding these new treatment pathways  and women s experiences when utilising them  must be conducted to provide more evidence-based options for women who want to address problematic drinking  Public health bodies could also learn more effective strategies from these innovative solutions to reduce alcohol consumption generally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957466
3349,The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered severe global restrictions on international travel with the intention of limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 across countries  This paper studies the causal effect of the partial relaxation of these travel restrictions in Europe on the COVID-19 incidence in Germany during the summer months of 2020  It exploits the staggered start of the summer school breaks across German states as an exogenous shock to the travel opportunities of the population  While the school breaks also increased mobility within Germany  the event-study type regressions precisely control for domestic mobility and local COVID-19-related restrictions  The intention-to-treat effects of the relaxed travel restrictions show a significant and sizable increase of the COVID-19 incidence in German counties during the later weeks of the school breaks  Part of the increase can be attributed to a mandatory testing regime for travel returnees from high-incidence areas,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953361
4842,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has revealed that even the best-resourced hospitals may lack sufficient ventilators to support patients under surge conditions  During a pandemic or mass trauma  an affordable  low-maintenance  off-the-shelf device that would allow health care teams to rapidly expand their ventilator capacity could prove lifesaving  but only if it can be safely integrated into a complex and rapidly changing clinical environment  Here  we define an approach to safe ventilator sharing that prioritizes predictable and independent care of patients sharing a ventilator  Subsequently  we detail the design and testing of a ventilator-splitting circuit that follows this approach and describe our clinical experience with this circuit during the COVID-19 pandemic  This circuit was able to provide individualized and titratable ventilatory support with individualized positive end-expiratory pressure  PEEP  to 2 critically ill patients at the same time  while insulating each patient from changes in the other s condition  We share insights from our experience using this technology in the intensive care unit and outline recommendations for future clinical applications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928890
2164,Sodium and water perturbations  manifesting as hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia  are common in patients who had an acute stroke  and are associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality  Other non-stroke-related causes of sodium and water perturbations in these patients include underlying comorbidities and concomitant medications  Additionally  hospitalised patients who had an acute stroke may receive excessive intravenous hypotonic solutions  have poor fluid intake due to impaired neurocognition and consciousness  may develop sepsis or are administered drugs  eg  mannitol   factors that can further alter serum sodium levels  Sodium and water perturbations can also be exacerbated by the development of endocrine consequences after an acute stroke  including secondary adrenal insufficiency  syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and diabetes insipidus  Recently  COVID-19 infection has been reported to increase the risk of development of sodium and water perturbations that may further worsen the outcomes of patients who had an acute stroke  Because there are currently no accepted consensus guidelines on the management of sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke  we conducted a systematic review of the literature published in English and in peer-reviewed journals between January 2000 and December 2020  according to PRISMA guidelines  to assess on the current knowledge and clinical practices of this condition  In this review  we discuss the signs and symptoms of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia  the pathogenesis of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia  their clinical relevance  and we provide our recommendations for effective treatment strategies for the neurologist in the management of sodium and water perturbations in commonly encountered aetiologies of patients who had an acute stroke,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969834

2223,SARS-CoV-2  an RNA virus  has been prone to high mutations since its first emergence in Wuhan  China  and throughout its spread  Its genome has been sequenced continuously by many countries  including Pakistan  but the results vary  Understanding its genomic patterns and connecting them with phenotypic features will help in devising therapeutic strategies  Thus  in this study  we explored the mutation landscape of 250 Pakistani isolates of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to check the genome diversity and examine the impact of these mutations on protein stability and viral pathogenesis in comparison with a reference sequence  Wuhan NC 045512 2   Our results revealed that structural proteins mainly exhibit more mutations than others in the Pakistani isolates  in particular  the nucleocapsid protein is highly mutated  In comparison  the spike protein is the most mutated protein globally  Furthermore  nsp12 was found to be the most mutated NSP in the Pakistani isolates and worldwide  Regarding accessory proteins  ORF3A is the most mutated in the Pakistani isolates  whereas ORF8 is highly mutated in world isolates  These mutations decrease the structural stability of their proteins and alter different biological pathways  Molecular docking  the dissociation constant  KD   and MM GBSA analysis showed that mutations in the S protein alter its binding with ACE2  The spike protein mutations D614G-S943T-V622F  -75 17 kcal mol   D614G-Q677H  -75 78 kcal mol   and N74K-D614G  -73 84 kcal mol  exhibit stronger binding energy than the wild type  -66 34 kcal mol   thus increasing infectivity  Furthermore  the simulation results strongly corroborated the predicted protein servers  Our analysis findings also showed that E  M  ORF6  ORF7A  ORF7B  and ORF10 are the most stable coding genes  they may be suitable targets for vaccine and drug development,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968862
5545,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has necessitated enhanced protection against viral transmission among healthcare professionals  particularly relating to handwashing and personal protective equipment  Some of these requirements may persist for years to come  They bring associated concerns around skin hygiene and general care  with damage to the face and hands now a well-documented consequence among healthcare professionals  This review assesses optimal skin care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic and in the  new normal  that will follow  identifies current knowledge gaps  and provides practical advice for the clinical setting  Regular  systematic hand cleaning with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub  containing 60 -90  ethanol or isopropyl alcohol  remains essential  although the optimal quantity and duration is unclear  Gloves are a useful additional barrier  further studies are needed on preferred materials  Moisturization is typically helpful and has proven benefits in mitigating damage from frequent handwashing  It may be best practiced using an alcohol-based hand rub with added moisturizer and could be particularly important among individuals with pre-existing hand dermatoses  such as psoriasis and eczema  Face moisturization immediately prior to donning a mask  and the use of dressings under the mask to reduce friction  can be helpful dermatologically  but more work is required to prove that these actions do not affect seal integrity  Nonetheless  such measures could play a role in institutional plans for mitigating the dermatologic impact of transmission control measures as we exit the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917384
7793,Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   It is the most challenging pandemic of this century  The growing COVID-19 pandemic has triggered extraordinary efforts to restrict the virus in numerous ways  owing to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2  Immunotherapy  which includes artificially stimulating the immune system to generate an immunological response  is regarded as an effective strategy for preventing and treating several infectious illnesses and malignancies  Given the pandemic s high fatality rate and quick expansion  an effective vaccination is urgently needed to keep it under control  The basic goal of all COVID-19 vaccine programs is to develop a vaccine that causes the generation of surface protein neutralizing antibodies in subjects  The epitope discovery for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates is likewise made using an immuno-informatics methodology  It can be used to find the epitopes in viral proteins important for cytotoxic T cells and B cells  A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine that can elicit the necessary immune response is necessary to end the epidemic  The global search for a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is yielding results  More than a dozen vaccines have already been approved around the world  with many more in the clinical trials  Patents can cover the underlying technology used to generate a vaccine  whereas trade secrets can cover manufacturing methods and procedures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886784
6547,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  as a binding receptor to enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis  CME   However  receptors involved in other steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown  Here  we found that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2  mGluR2  is an internalization factor for SARS-CoV-2  Our results show that mGluR2 directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and that knockdown of mGluR2 decreases internalization of SARS-CoV-2 but not cell binding  Further  mGluR2 is uncovered to cooperate with ACE2 to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 internalization through CME and mGluR2 knockout in mice abolished SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasal turbinates and significantly reduced viral infection in the lungs  Notably  mGluR2 is also important for SARS-CoV spike protein- and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein-mediated internalization  Thus  our study identifies a novel internalization factor used by SARS-CoV-2 and opens a new door for antiviral development against coronavirus infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903715

761,Thousands of drugs  nutraceuticals and their combinations can be used to select candidate therapeutics for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its symptoms in order to curb COVID-19  A comprehensive  multi-level strategy against COVID-19 should include drug targeting of biomolecules and biochemical pathways involved in the prevention and proliferation of the infection  and the fatal or serious symptoms following infection  Several drugs are routinely used in the treatment of different categories of seriously ill COVID-19 patients including tocilizumab  remdesivir and dexamethasone  The current risk benefit assessment supports the emergency testing and approval of more drugs  The process for new drug selection could be based on the identification of one drug for one target  or of a multi-potent drug for many targets and drug combinations for one or more targets  that can cause a substantial reduction in the high mortality rate of COVID-19  Several drugs have been identified that can fit this potential role by targeting different stages of COVID-19 including baricitinib  molnupiravir and PF-07321332 ritonavir and also the combination of deferiprone with N-acetylcysteine for inhibiting the vicious circle of oxidative stress toxicity and endothelial cell damage  Most of these drugs are expected to be effective against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron  B 1 1 529  and also the associated COVID-19 complications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994185
3467,OBJECTIVES  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic  many researchers have developed artificial intelligence  AI  tools to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other conditions in chest CT  However  in many cases  performance has not been clinically validated  The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of commercial AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung conditions  METHODS  Four commercial AI solutions were evaluated on a dual-center clinical dataset consisting of 500 CT studies  COVID-19 pneumonia was microbiologically proven in 50 of these  Sensitivity  specificity  positive and negative predictive values  and AUC were calculated  In a subgroup analysis  the performance of the AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other conditions was evaluated in CT studies with ground-glass opacities  GGOs   RESULTS  Sensitivity and specificity ranges were 62-96  and 31-80   respectively  Negative and positive predictive values ranged between 82-99  and 19-25   respectively  AUC was in the range 0 54-0 79  In CT studies with GGO  sensitivity remained unchanged  However  specificity was lower  and ranged between 15 and 53   AUC for studies with GGO was in the range 0 54-0 69  CONCLUSIONS  This study highlights the variable specificity and low positive predictive value of AI solutions in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in chest CT  However  one solution yielded acceptable values for sensitivity  Thus  with further improvement  commercial AI solutions currently under development have the potential to be integrated as alert tools in clinical routine workflow  Randomized trials are needed to assess the true benefits and also potential harms of the use of AI in image analysis  KEY POINTS    Commercial AI solutions achieved a sensitivity and specificity ranging from 62 to 96  and from 31 to 80   respectively  in identifying patients suspicious for COVID-19 in a clinical dataset    Sensitivity remained within the same range  while specificity was even lower in subgroup analysis of CT studies with ground-glass opacities  and interrater agreement between the commercial AI solutions was minimal to nonexistent    Thus  commercial AI solutions have the potential to be integrated as alert tools for the detection of patients with lung changes suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia in a clinical routine workflow  if further improvement is made,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950973

3745,The scale of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic warrants the urgent establishment of a global decentralized surveillance system to recognize local outbreaks and the emergence of novel variants of concern  Among available deep-sequencing technologies  nanopore-sequencing could be an important cornerstone  as it is mobile  scalable  and cost-effective  Therefore  streamlined nanopore-sequencing protocols need to be developed and optimized for SARS-CoV-2 variants identification  We adapted and simplified existing workflows using the  midnight  1200 bp amplicon split primer sets for PCR  which produce tiled overlapping amplicons covering almost the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome  Subsequently  we applied Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcoding and the portable MinION Mk1C sequencer combined with the interARTIC bioinformatics pipeline  We tested a simplified and less time-consuming workflow using SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens from clinical routine and identified the CT value as a useful pre-analytical parameter  which may help to decrease sequencing failures rates  Complete pipeline duration was approx  7 h for one specimen and approx  11 h for 12 multiplexed barcoded specimens  The adapted protocol contains fewer processing steps and can be completely conducted within one working day  Diagnostic CT values deduced from qPCR standardization experiments can act as principal criteria for specimen selection  As a guideline  SARS-CoV-2 genome copy numbers lower than 4 x 10 6  were associated with a coverage threshold below 20-fold and incompletely assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes  Thus  based on the described thermocycler chemistry combination  we recommend CT values of  26 or lower to achieve full and high-quality SARS-CoV-2    RNA genome coverage,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946199
4693,Introduction  Current NHS guidelines recommend that treatment of colorectal patients referred through the two-week wait referral system should occur within sixty two days from the date of referral  The COVID-19 pandemic which started in March 2020 has however led to significant delays in the delivery of health services  including colorectal cancer treatments  This study investigates the effects of delayed colorectal cancer treatments during the COVID pandemic on disease progression  Methods  A retrospective chart review of 107 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer was conducted  The occurrence of cancer upstaging after initial diagnosis was assessed and compared between patients with treatment delays and patients who received treatments within the period recommended by NHS guidelines  A logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between treatment delays beyond 62 days and cancer upstaging  Results  The median age of the cohort was 71 2 years and 64 5  of the patients were over 65 years  Treatment delays were observed in 53 3  of reviewed patients  Patients with treatment delays received cancer treatments 95 8  31 0  days on average after referral  compared to 46 3  11 5  days in patients who experienced no treatment delays  p-value<0 0001   38 6  of patients with treatment delays experienced cancer upstaging by the time of treatment  compared to 20  in the non-delay group  p-value   0 036   Patients who received treatment after sixty two days from date of referral were 3 27 times more likely to experience colorectal cancer upstaging compared to those who received timely treatments  Conclusion  Although an effective response to the Covid-19 pandemic requires the reallocation of healthcare resources  there is a need to ensure that treatments and health outcomes of patients with chronic diseases such as colorectal cancer continue to be prioritized and delivered in timely fashion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931144
4099,BACKGROUND  Abnormal inflammation coagulation biomarker levels of troponin  C-reactive protein  CRP   and D-dimer levels in serum have been demonstrated to be associated and involved in the disease progression of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   METHODS  First  the study aimed to investigate the correlation of troponin  CRP  d-dimer  white blood cell  WBC  and polymerase chain reaction-cycle threshold  PCR-Ct  within COVID-19 survivors  143 patients  79 males  64 females  and in deceased  30 patients  12 males  18 females  group  Also  assessing any differences between both groups in studied parameters  Second  a correlation study of studied parameters  level has been conducted within families  41 patients  23 males  seven deaths  and 18 females  eight deaths   that lost more than one member due to the severity of the disease  Also  differences between these family and control group  132 patients  69 males and 63 females  group in studied parameters have been assessed  RESULTS  In the first week of hospitalization  there were significant differences in D-dimer  CRP and troponin level between survived and deceased patient groups  In the second week of the admission  both groups had significant differences in the level of all studied parameters  troponin I  D-dimer  CRP  and WBCs  WBC levels positively correlated to CRP in male survivors  r   0 75  p < 0 0001   and to troponin in deceased male patients  r   0 74  p   0 007   The second week of patient admission was critical in the group of families who lost more than one person  when troponin was correlated positively with D-dimer  CRP  and WBCs  CONCLUSION  Troponin  D-dimer  CRP  and WBCs level were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died than in COVID-19 survivors  High troponin and WBC levels  were considerably associated with families that lost more than one member  when compared with the unrelated COVID-19 patient control,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939346
1488,On the 24  th  November 2021 the sequence of a new SARS CoV-2 viral isolate spreading rapidly in Southern Africa was announced  containing far more mutations in Spike  S  than previously reported variants  Neutralization titres of Omicron by sera from vaccinees and convalescent subjects infected with early pandemic as well as Alpha  Beta  Gamma  Delta are substantially reduced or fail to neutralize  Titres against Omicron are boosted by third vaccine doses and are high in cases both vaccinated and infected by Delta  Mutations in Omicron knock out or substantially reduce neutralization by most of a large panel of potent monoclonal antibodies and antibodies under commercial development  Omicron S has structural changes from earlier viruses  combining mutations conferring tight binding to ACE2 to unleash evolution driven by immune escape  leading to a large number of mutations in the ACE2 binding site which rebalance receptor affinity to that of early pandemic viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981049
586,The recently emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant omicron displays an unusual association of 30 mutations  3 deletions and 1 insertion  To analyze the impact of this atypic mutational landscape  we constructed a complete structure of the Omicron spike protein  Compared with the delta variant  the receptor binding domain  RBD  of omicron has an increased electrostatic surface potential  but a decreased affinity for the ACE-2 receptor  The N-terminal domain  NTD  has both a decreased surface potential and a lower affinity for lipid rafts  The omicron variant is predicted to be less fusogenic and thus less pathogenic than delta  due to a geometric reorganization of the S1-S2 cleavage site  Overall  these virological parameters suggest that omicron does not have a significant infectivity advantage over the delta variant  However  in omicron  neutralizing epitopes are greatly affected  suggesting that current vaccines will probably confer little protection against this variant  In conclusion  the puzzling mutational pattern of the omicron variant combines contradictory properties which may either decrease  virological properties  or increase  immunological escape facilitation  the transmission of this variant in the human population  This Janus-like phenotype may explain some conflicting reports on the initial assessment of omicron and provides new insights about the molecular mechanisms controlling its dissemination and pathogenesis worldwide  This article is protected by copyright  All rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997962

2548,BACKGROUND  Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression  but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states  Digital language  particularly through personal text messages  is one source that can measure these markers  METHODS  We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity  We enrolled 219 U S  adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study  Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones  which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity  collected phone sensor data  and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages  We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features  RESULTS  In correlation analyses  we find that degrees of depression  emotional  and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression  validating prior literature  Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0 72 when only considering text features and 0 76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors  LIMITATIONS  Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women  caucasians  and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline  As language use differs across demographic factors  generalizability beyond this population may be limited  The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States  which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality  CONCLUSIONS  Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment  especially when combined with other personal sensors  could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963643
1566,Although South Korea has been relatively successful in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic  there were controversies surrounding the negative social consequences  SC  associated with the infection  such as breach of privacy in contact tracing and stigmatization of patients  We examined how individuals  thinking about the SC of COVID-19 infection influenced preventive intention through this specific case  the early phase of the pandemic in South Korea  March  2020  when concerns regarding SC were very high but vaccines were not available  We theoretically investigated the path from information exposure about COVID-19  worry and risk perception about SC of COVID-19  attitudes norms self-efficacy  and preventive intention  An online survey of 805 South Koreans revealed that information exposure about COVID-19 was positively associated with worry and risk perception about the SC  which indirectly predicted preventive intention through attitudes norms self-efficacy  As COVID-19 is a new disease  people learned about it from various sources  and contemplated  worry and risk perception  its negative social outcomes  To avoid such negative SC  they might have changed their beliefs toward preventive behavior  which influenced preventive intention  Given that both worry  affective-cognitive state  and risk perception  cognitive evaluation  are related to thinking activities  the findings suggest that individuals  thinking about negative SC of COVID-19 infection might have partly contributed to the success of the early South Korean quarantine model  However  the results also raise critical questions as to how we can protect individuals  lives during a public health crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979829
7879,COVID-19 is an emerging respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus accompanied by a tsunami of misinformation and fake news  This can weaken the public health responses by affecting the COVID-19-related knowledge  attitudes  and practices  KAP  of the public  Therefore  this cross-sectional study was designed during the early stage of the pandemic to evaluate the KAP of Palestinian university students and their commonly used information sources  We found that the most trusted information source among students was the World Health Organization  WHO   followed by the Palestinian Ministry of Health  MoH  briefings and healthcare workers  whereas social media was the most frequently used source of information  The participants exhibited a high level of COVID-19-related knowledge  having an average score of 8 65  range  0-10   In total  76  avoided going to crowded places  and only 33  wore a mask while being outdoors  The vast majority  93   checked the accuracy of COVID-19-related information before publishing it  56  used the WHO and MoH briefings for fact-checking  and only 8  relied on healthcare workers  This was particularly the case for those who lived in refugee camps  This study provides an insight into the information sources used by Palestinian university students  the sources they trust  and the information formats they prefer  These results may help public health authorities to locate the information sources through which university students should be targeted  Efforts should be made to recommend healthcare workers as credible information sources  In this way  they will be able to prevent the spread of misleading information and provide high-quality information  especially within unconventional settings such as refugee camps,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886184
1597,BACKGROUND  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  less acute care surgical procedures have been performed and consequently hospitals have experienced significant revenue loss  We aim to investigate these procedures performed before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  as well as their effect on the economy  METHODS  This is a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent cholecystectomies and appendectomies during March-May 2019 compared to the same time period in 2020 using Chi-square and t-tests  RESULTS  There were 345 patients who presented with appendicitis or cholecystitis to Elmhurst Hospital Center during the March-May 2019 and 2020 time period  There were three times as many total operations  or about 75   in 2019  261  compared to 2020  84   There was a decrease in the number of admissions from 2019 to 2020 for both acute cholecystitis  149 vs 43  respectively  and acute appendicitis  112 vs 41  respectively   The largest decrease in the number of admissions in 2020 compared to 2019 was observed in April 2020  98 vs 9  P <  01  followed by May  69 vs 20  P <  01   and March  94 vs 55  P <  01   Corresponding to the decrease in operative patterns was a noticeable six-time reduction in revenue for the procedures in 2019   187 283  compared to 2020   30 415   CONCLUSION  We observed almost a triple reduction in the number of cholecystitis and appendicitis procedures performed during the 2020 pandemic surge as compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic data  Elmhurst hospital also experienced four times the loss of revenue during the same time period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979090

4502,INTRODUCTION  Faced with the coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic  governments worldwide instituted lockdowns to curtail virus spread  Health facility closures and travel restrictions disrupted access to antiretroviral  ARV  therapy for people living with HIV  This report describes how HIV programs in Indonesia  Laos  Nepal  and Nigeria supported treatment continuation by introducing home delivery of ARVs  METHODS  Staff supporting the programs provided accounts of when and how decisions were taken to support ARV home delivery  They captured programmatic information about home delivery implementation using an intervention documentation tool  The 4 country experiences revealed lessons learned about factors favoring successful expansion of ARV home delivery  RESULTS  Three of the countries relied on existing networks of community health workers for ARV delivery  the fourth country  Indonesia  relied on a private sector courier service  Across the 4 countries  between 19  and 51  of eligible clients were served by home delivery  The experiences showed that ARV home delivery is feasible and acceptable to health service providers  clients  and other stakeholders  Essential to success was rapid mobilization of stakeholders who led the design of the home delivery mechanisms and provided leadership support of the service innovations  Timely service adaptation was made possible by pre-existing differentiated models of care supportive of community-based ARV provision by outreach workers  Home delivery models prioritized protection of client confidentiality and prevention measures for COVID-19  Sustainability of the innovation depends on reinforcement of the commodity management infrastructure and investment in financing mechanisms  CONCLUSION  Home delivery of ARVs is a feasible client-centered approach to be included among the options for decentralized drug distribution  It serves as a measure for expanding access to care both when access to health services is disrupted and under routine circumstances,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933991
6889,One year after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic  governments around the world adopt similar practices in containing the COVID-19 spread  Nevertheless  variation exists in the level of policy compliance  which directly contribute to policy success failure across countries  As the pandemic continues  pandemic fatigue also decreases the public s willingness to comply  Increasing policy compliance during the remainder of pandemic has become a transnational concern  Using Taiwan s quarantine policy as an example  this article illustrates three aspects to craft an effective compliance regime to fight public health crises like COVID-19   1  a comprehensive policy mix to reduce heterogeneous compliance barriers that impact different social groups   2  constant and various policy communication with heterogeneous target audiences  and  3  leveraging and integrating street-level bureaucrats in the policy implementation stages  Taiwan s case provides several policy lessons for other countries  compliance regime is not driven by top-down enforcement but through the integration of policy design and implementation that remove all barriers for compliance  Taiwan s street level bureaucrats are the glue of the compliance regime  This article bears policy implications for policy makers around the world when aiming for increasing policy compliance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899995
7118,For the control of COVID-19  vaccination programmes provide a long-term solution  The amount of available vaccines is often limited  and thus it is crucial to determine the allocation strategy  While mathematical modelling approaches have been used to find an optimal distribution of vaccines  there is an excessively large number of possible allocation schemes to be simulated  Here  we propose an algorithm to find a near-optimal allocation scheme given an intervention objective such as minimization of new infections  hospitalizations  or deaths  where multiple vaccines are available  The proposed principle for allocating vaccines is to target subgroups with the largest reduction in the outcome of interest  We use an approximation method to reconstruct the age-specific transmission intensity  the next generation matrix   and express the expected impact of vaccinating each subgroup in terms of the observed incidence of infection and force of infection  The proposed approach is firstly evaluated with a simulated epidemic and then applied to the epidemiological data on COVID-19 in the Netherlands  Our results reveal how the optimal allocation depends on the objective of infection control  In the case of COVID-19  if we wish to minimize deaths  the optimal allocation strategy is not efficient for minimizing other outcomes  such as infections  In simulated epidemics  an allocation strategy optimized for an outcome outperforms other strategies such as the allocation from young to old  from old to young  and at random  Our simulations clarify that the current policy in the Netherlands  i e   allocation from old to young  was concordant with the allocation scheme that minimizes deaths  The proposed method provides an optimal allocation scheme  given routine surveillance data that reflect ongoing transmissions  This approach to allocation is useful for providing plausible simulation scenarios for complex models  which give a more robust basis to determine intervention strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898617

4619,BACKGROUND  There is a growing interest in using mobile apps to support communication  safety  and well-being  Evidence directly from people with dementia regarding the usability  usefulness  and relevance of mobile apps is limited  OBJECTIVE  This paper describes the protocol of a study that will evaluate an app designed for supporting communication  safety  and well-being among people living with dementia  The study aims to understand if the app can enhance safety through improved communication among users  METHODS  The study will use participatory qualitative methods over 3 cycles of evaluation with co-designers  service users  their families  and care practitioners   The study will be developed in partnership with a specialist home care service in England  Purposive case selection will be performed to ensure that the cases exemplify differences in experiences  The app will be evaluated in a walk-through workshop by people living with early-stage dementia and then trialed at home by up to 12 families in a try-out cycle  An amended version will be evaluated in a final walk-through workshop during cycle 3  Data will be collected from at least 4 data sources during the try-out phase and analyzed thematically  An explanatory multiple case study design will be used to synthesize and present the evidence from the three cycles  drawing on the Normalization Process Theory to support the interpretation of the findings  RESULTS  The study is ready to be implemented  but it was paused to protect vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020  The findings will be particularly relevant for understanding how to support vulnerable people living in the community during social distancing and the period following the pandemic as well as for providing insight into the challenges of social isolation that arise from living with dementia  CONCLUSIONS  Evaluating a mobile app for enhancing communication  safety  and well-being among people living with dementia contributes to the key ambitions enshrined in policy and practice-championing the use of digital technology and supporting people with dementia to live safely in their own homes  The study will involve co-designers living with dementia  so that the voices of service users can be used to highlight the benefits and challenges of assistive technology and shape the future development of apps that enhance safety by improving communication  INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER  IRRID   PRR1-10 2196 19543,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932011
901,BACKGROUND  The serine protease inhibitor nafamostat has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19  by inhibiting TMPRSS2-mediated viral cell entry  Nafamostat has been shown to have other  immunomodulatory effects  which may be beneficial for treatment  however animal models of ssRNA virus infection are lacking  In this study  we examined the potential of the dual TLR7 8 agonist R848 to mimic the host response to an ssRNA virus infection and the associated behavioural response  In addition  we evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of nafamostat in this model  METHODS  CD-1 mice received an intraperitoneal injection of R848  200 mug  prepared in DMSO  diluted 1 10 in saline  or diluted DMSO alone  and an intravenous injection of either nafamostat  100 muL  3 mg kg in 5  dextrose  or 5  dextrose alone  Sickness behaviour was determined by temperature  food intake  sucrose preference test  open field and forced swim test  Blood and fresh liver  lung and brain were collected 6 h post-challenge to measure markers of peripheral and central inflammation by blood analysis  immunohistochemistry and qPCR  RESULTS  R848 induced a robust inflammatory response  as evidenced by increased expression of TNF  IFN-gamma  CXCL1 and CXCL10 in the liver  lung and brain  as well as a sickness behaviour phenotype  Exogenous administration of nafamostat suppressed the hepatic inflammatory response  significantly reducing TNF and IFN-gamma expression  but had no effect on lung or brain cytokine production  R848 administration depleted circulating leukocytes  which was restored by nafamostat treatment  CONCLUSIONS  Our data indicate that R848 administration provides a useful model of ssRNA virus infection  which induces inflammation in the periphery and CNS  and virus infection-like illness  In turn  we show that nafamostat has a systemic anti-inflammatory effect in the presence of the TLR7 8 agonist  Therefore  the results indicate that nafamostat has anti-inflammatory actions  beyond its ability to inhibit TMPRSS2  that might potentiate its anti-viral actions in pathologies such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34991643

5843,Background  Vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the general population and health care workers play an important role in successfully controlling the Coronavirus Disease  COVID -19 pandemic  While there is evidence for vaccine hesitancy across the globe  wide variation in factors influencing vaccine acceptance has been reported  mainly from High-Income Countries  HIC   However  the evidence from Low- and Middle-Income Countries  LMICs  remains unclear  The objective of this review was to describe the determinants of vaccine acceptance and strategies to address those in an LMIC context  Methods  The World Health Organization s  WHO  Measuring Behavioral and Social Drivers of Vaccination  BeSD  Increasing Vaccination Model was employed to identify factors that influenced vaccine acceptance  All evidence related to supply-side and demand-side determinants and social and health system processes were examined  A comprehensive search for published literature was conducted in three databases and grey literature in relevant websites of government  multinational agencies  and COVID-19 resource aggregators  followed by a narrative synthesis  Results  Overall  the results showed that the vaccine acceptance rates differed across LMICs  with a wide variety of reasons cited for vaccine hesitancy  Vaccine acceptance was reportedly greater among males  those with higher education  elevated socio-economic status  the unmarried  those employed as health care workers  Evidence suggested that exposure to misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines and public concerns over the safety of vaccines may contribute to lower acceptance rates  Strategies to increase vaccine acceptance rates included direct engagement with communities through influencers  including community leaders and health experts  clear and transparent communication about COVID-19 vaccines  financial and non-financial incentives  and strong endorsement from health care workers  Trust in government was identified as a significant enabler of vaccine acceptance  Conclusions  There is a need for measures to address public acceptability  trust and concern over the safety and benefit of approved vaccines  Local context is essential to consider while developing programs to promote vaccine uptake  The governments worldwide also need to strategize to develop plans to address the anxiety and vaccine related concerns of community regarding vaccine hesitancy  There is a need for further research to evaluate strategies to address vaccine hesitancy in LMIC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912550
7585,COVID-19 is frequently associated with abnormalities on coagulation testing and a coagulopathy driven by inflammation  intravascular coagulation activation  and microvascular thrombosis  Elevated D-dimer is the most common finding and is a predictor of adverse outcomes including thrombosis  critical illness  and death  Although COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has some similarities to disseminated intravascular coagulation  the platelet count is usually preserved  coagulation times are usually normal or minimally prolonged  and thrombosis is more common than bleeding  at least in noncritically ill patients  Bleeding is uncommon but may be a significant problem in critically ill patients  including those who may develop a consumptive coagulopathy with frank disseminated intravascular coagulation and those on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  Blood product support to correct coagulopathy is reserved for bleeding patients or those requiring invasive procedures  Current recommendations suggest that all hospitalized patients should receive at least a prophylactic dose of anticoagulation  Results from a multiplatform randomized clinical trial suggest that therapeutically dosed anticoagulation may improve outcomes  including the need for organ support and mortality in moderately ill patients but not in those requiring critical care  The results of ongoing trials evaluating the impact of different antithrombotic strategies  therapeutic agents and intensity  on COVID-19 outcomes are eagerly awaited and are expected to have important implications for patient management  We also discuss COVID-19 vaccine-associated cytopenias and bleeding as well as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia  in which thrombosis is associated with thrombocytopenia  elevated D-dimer  and  frequently  hypofibrinogenemia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889412
2737,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has mobilized many efforts worldwide to curb its impact on morbidity and mortality  Vaccination of the general population has resulted in the administration of more than 6 700 000 000 doses by the end of October 2021  which is the most effective method to prevent hospitalization and death  Among the adverse effects described  myocarditis and pericarditis are low-frequency events  less than 10 per 100 000 people   mainly observed with messenger RNA vaccines  The mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been specified  considering an exacerbated and uncontrolled immune response and an autoimmune response against specific cardiomyocyte proteins  This greater immunogenicity and reactogenicity is clinically manifested in a differential manner in pediatric patients  adults  and the elderly  determining specific characteristics of its presentation for each age group  It generally develops as a condition of mild to moderate severity  whose symptoms and imaging findings are self-limited  resolving favorably in days to weeks and  exceptionally  reporting deaths associated with this complication  The short- and medium-term prognosis is favorable  highlighting the lack of data on long-term evolution  which should be determined in longer follow-ups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960761

6977,The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health and social distancing mandates caused unprecedented shifts and disruptions for local and regional food systems  LRFS   The pandemic also brought new and heightened attention to the structure and resiliency of US food systems  and LRFS appeared to be positioned to significantly increase the scope and scale of their market reach as a result  Researchers from three universities collaborated with staff from the U S  Department of Agriculture s Agricultural Marketing Service to recruit leaders from sixteen key coalitions within the U S  LRFS sector to frame an adaptive  community-driven set of applied research activities to understand important themes  learn from effective responses and gain insights into how local and regional supply chains may change post-pandemic  In this paper  we summarise urgent and emergent strategies and innovations from LRFS captured in a fall 2020 consumer survey  with additional insights on how the survey was framed and interpreted  considering synthesis of collaborative discussions and project team interactions  We conclude the article with a set of research  policy and technical assistance priorities that were identified and validated by this LRFS network,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899035
4626,The recent emergence of COVID-19 variants has necessitated the development of new vaccines that stimulate the formation of high levels of neutralizing antibodies against S antigen variants  A new strategy involves the intradermal administration of heterologous vaccines composed of one or two doses of inactivated vaccine and a booster dose with the mutated S1 protein  K-S   Such vaccines improve the immune efficacy by increasing the neutralizing antibody titers and promoting specific T cell responses against five variants of the RBD protein  A viral challenge test with the B 1 617 2  Delta  variant confirmed that both administration schedules  i e   1   1  and  2   1   ensured protection against this strain  These results suggest that the aforementioned strategy is effective for protecting against new variants and enhances the anamnestic immune response in the immunized population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931939
8426,The COVID-19 pandemic has augmented discourses of individual citizen responsibility for collective health  This article explores how British Columbia  Canada s widely praised COVID-19 communication participates in the development of neo-communitarian  active citizenship  governmentalities focused on the civic duty of voluntarily taking responsibility for the health of one s community  We do so by investigating how public health updates from BC s acclaimed Provincial Health Officer Dr  Bonnie Henry articulate this civic imperative through the rhetorical constitution of the  good covid citizen   Our rhetorical analysis shows how this pro-social communication interpellates citizens within a discourse of behavioral  epistemic  and ethical responsibilisation  The communal ethos constituted through this public health communication significantly increases the burden of personal responsibility for health beyond norms of self-care  Making the protection of community health primarily the responsibility of individual citizens also presumes a privileged identity of empowered  active agency and implicitly excludes citizens who lack the means to successfully fulfill the expectations of good covid citizenship,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875901
801,Background  Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is characterized by the presence of sterile vegetations on a cardiac valve  We present a case of multi-territory stroke caused by embolism of a non-bacterial thrombotic aortic valve endocarditis  leading to the diagnosis of a prostate adenocarcinoma with bone metastases  Case summary  A 66-year-old patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism  first attributed to an asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 infection  Edoxaban was started  which was discontinued by the patient  Four weeks later  he presented with subacute vertigo and balance disorders  Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multi-territory stroke  A transoesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated a small vegetation on the aortic valve with moderate aortic insufficiency  Blood cultures remained negative  Malignancy screening showed a markedly elevated prostate-specific antigen  Prostate adenocarcinoma was confirmed on biopsy  A positron emission tomography revealed metastatic disease  A diagnosis of non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis and paraneoplastic pulmonary embolism secondary to prostate cancer was made  Edoxaban was restarted and the patient was referred for treatment of the prostate adenocarcinoma  Follow-up after 5 months showed no evidence of aortic valve vegetations  Discussion  Coronavirus disease 2019 in ambulatory patients may be insufficient as a predisposing factor for venous thrombo-embolism and these patients  especially the elderly  should undergo a screening for malignancy  Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a rare cause of multi-territory stroke  When related to cancer  the prostate can be the primary tumour,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993406
8294,Older people are a high-risk group for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  because of a range of factors  including age-related changes in anatomical pulmonary and muscle function  decreased immunity and increased inflammation  These factors partly explain why older people with COVID-19 experience more severe symptoms and higher mortality than younger adults and are more likely to require nutritional support  Furthermore  there is an association between suboptimal nutritional status and poorer recovery from COVID-19  Therefore  nutritional interventions are an important aspect of care for older people with COVID-19  All members of the multidisciplinary team  including dietitians and nurses  need to assess  treat and prevent nutritional deficiencies in older people with COVID-19  This literature review provides an overview of the evidence regarding the role of nutritional interventions in the treatment of  and recovery from  COVID-19 in older people,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877834

2543,COVID-19 pandemic created a global shortage of medical protective equipment  Here  we considered ozone  O3  a disinfectant alternative due to its potent oxidative activity against biological macromolecules  The O3 decontamination assays were done using SARS-CoV-2 obtained from patients to produce artificial contamination of N95 masks and biosecurity gowns  The quantification of SARS-CoV-2 was performed before and after exposing the samples to different ozone gas concentrations for times between 5 and 30 min  Viral loads as a function of the O3 exposure time were estimated from the data obtained by the RT-PCR technique  The genetic material of the virus was no longer detected for any tested concentrations after 15 min of O3 exposure  which means a disinfection Concentration-Time above 144 ppm min  Vibrational spectroscopies were used to follow the modifications of the polymeric fibers after the O3 treatment  The results indicate that the N95 masks could be safely reused after decontamination with treatments of 15 min at the established O3 doses for a maximum of 6 cycles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963705
7498,The outbreak of a new coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  was first identified in Wuhan  People s Republic of China  in 2019  which has led to a severe  life-threatening form of pneumonia  COVID-19   Research scientists all around the world have been trying to find small molecule drugs to treat COVID-19  In the present study  a conserved macrodomain  ADP Ribose phosphatase  ADRP   of a critical non-structural protein  Nsp3  in all coronaviruses was probed using large-scale Molecular Dynamics  MD  simulations to identify novel inhibitors  In our virtual screening workflow  the recently-solved X-ray complex structure  6W6Y  with a substrate-mimics was used to screen 17 million ZINC15 compounds using drug property filters and Glide docking scores  The top twenty output compounds each underwent 200 ns MD simulations  i e  20 x 200 ns  to validate their individual stability as potential inhibitors  Eight out of the twenty compounds showed stable binding modes in the MD simulations  as well as favorable drug properties from our predctions  Therefore  our computational data suggest that the resulting top eight out of twenty compounds could potentially be novel inhibitors to ADRP of SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891093
4782,OBJECTIVE  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause disease in humans and animals  In humans  it usually causes respiratory infections  from the common cold to serious illnesses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  MERS  and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  SARS   The disease is mainly spread between people through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes  This virus can last up to three days with plastic and stainless steel SARS CoV-2 can last up to three days  or in aerosols for 3h  METHOD  The methodology of this research is indirect observation  Existing data analyzed with a preventive intervention approach and then described with a qualitative descriptive method  RESULT  Based on research that has been carried out  infection with the COVID-19 virus in pregnant women can not only cause severe symptoms in the mother  but also poses a risk of harm to the baby they are carrying  Therefore  preventive measures need to be taken so that pregnant women are not easily infected with the Corona virus  CONCLUSION  COVID-19 is a new disease that has become a pandemic  This disease should be watched out for because transmission is relatively fast  has a mortality rate that cannot be ignored  and there is no definitive therapy  There are still many knowledge gaps in this field  so further studies are needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929907
311,The coronavirus disease  COVID-19  has brought significant social and economic disruptions and devastating impacts on public health  and vaccines are being developed to combat the disease  Timely vaccination may prevent complications and morbidity but may also potentially result in unforeseen outcomes in some special clinical populations  We report on a case of hypersomnia relapse after the COVID-19 vaccination  with the aim of informing the development of the guideline on vaccination in specific groups  A 19-year old female presented with persistent daytime sleepiness after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine  She had a known history of hypersomnia secondary to infectious mononucleosis but has fully recovered for 8 months  A series of examinations were performed on this patient  Neurologic and psychiatric examinations were unremarkable  Despite normal nocturnal subjective sleep quality  Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score   5  Insomnia Severity Index score   7   her Epworth sleepiness scale score  15  suggested an abnormal level of subjective sleepiness  Consistent with the subjective report  the objective assessment by Multiple Sleep Latency Test found mean sleep latency was 1 3 min with no sleep onset rapid-eye-movement  REM  period  We speculate that COVID-19 vaccine may potentially trigger the relapse of hypersomnia  The immune memory could be an explanation for the increased response to vaccine in patients with secondary hypersomnia  Caution should be warranted when administering COVID-19 vaccine in patients with hypersomnia secondary to infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002346
4965,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has disrupted undergraduate medical education  including preclinical class-based courses  by requiring social distancing and essentially eliminating in-person teaching  The aim of this study was to compare student performance and satisfaction before and after implementation of remote instruction in a first-year introductory pathology course  Assessments  3 quizzes  1 practical exam  and 1 final  were compared between courses given before  January 2020  and during  January 2021  the COVID-19 pandemic  in terms of mean scores  degree of difficulty  and item discrimination  both overall and across different question types  Students  evaluations of the course  Likert scale-based  were also compared between the 2 years  Significantly higher mean scores were observed during remote instruction  compared to the prior  in-person year  on verbatim-repeated questions  94 9   - 8 8 vs 89 4   - 12 2  P    002  and on questions incorporating a gross specimen image  88 4   - 7 5 vs 84 4   - 10 3  P    007   The percentage of questions that were determined to be moderate hard in degree of difficulty and good very good in item discrimination remained similar between the 2 time periods  In the practical examination  students performed significantly better during remote instruction on questions without specimen images  96 5   - 7 0 vs 91 2   - 15 2  P    004   Finally  course evaluation metrics improved  with students giving a higher mean rating value in each measured end point of course quality during the year of remote instruction  In conclusion  student performance and course satisfaction generally improved with remote instruction  suggesting that the changes implemented  and their consequences  should perhaps inform future curriculum improvements,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926798
429,BACKGROUND  Assessing the public s willingness to pay  WTP  for the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccine by the contingent valuation  CV  method can provide a relevant basis for government pricing  However  the scope issue of the CV method can seriously affect the validity and reliability of the estimation results  AIM  To examine whether there are scope issues in respondents  WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine and to further verify the validity and reliability of the CV estimate results  METHOD  In this study  nine different CV double-bounded dichotomous choices  DBDC  hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine scenarios were designed using an orthogonal experimental design based on the vaccine s attributes  A total of 2450 samples from 31 provinces in Mainland China were collected to independently estimate the public s WTP in these nine scenarios with logistic  normal  log-logistic and log-normal parameter models  Based on this estimation  several external scope tests were designed to verify the validity and reliability of the CV estimate results  RESULTS  In the 20 pairs of COVID-19 vaccine scenarios  6 pairs of scenarios were classified as negative scope issues  therefore not passing the external scope test  Of the remaining 14 pairs of scenarios  only four pairs of scenarios completely passed the external scope test  and one pair of scenarios partially passed the external scope test  Significant negative scope and scope insensitivity issues were revealed  CONCLUSION  In the context of a dynamic pandemic environment  the findings of this study reveal that the CV method may face difficulty in effectively estimating respondents  WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine  We suggest that future studies be cautious in applying the CV method to estimate the public s WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001293

5123,The global spread of COVID-19 has not been effectively controlled  posing a huge threat to public health and the development of the global economy  Currently  a number of vaccines have been approved for use and vaccination campaigns have already started in several countries  This paper designs a mathematical model considering the impact of vaccination to study the spread dynamics of COVID-19  Some basic properties of the model are analyzed  The basic reproductive number Re 1 of the model is obtained  and the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibria are provided  There exist two endemic equilibria when Re 1 < 1 under certain conditions  which will lead to backward bifurcation  The stability of equilibria are analyzed  and the condition for the backward bifurcation is given  Due to the existence of backward bifurcation  even if Re 1 < 1   COVID-19 may remain prevalent  Sensitivity analysis and simulations show that improving vaccine efficacy can control the spread of COVID-19 faster  while increasing the vaccination rate can reduce and postpone the peak of infection to a greater extent  However  in reality  the improvement of vaccine efficacy cannot be realized in a short time  and relying only on increasing the vaccination rate cannot quickly achieve the control of COVID-19  Therefore  relying only on vaccination may not completely and quickly control COVID-19  Some non-pharmaceutical interventions should continue to be enforced to combat the virus  According to the sensitivity analysis  we improve the model by including some non-pharmaceutical interventions  Combining the sensitivity analysis with the simulation of the improved model  we conclude that together with vaccination  reducing the contact rate of people and increasing the isolation rate of infected individuals will greatly reduce the number of infections and shorten the time of COVID-19 spread  The analysis and simulations in this paper can provide some useful suggestions for the prevention and control of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924686

8799,SARS-CoV-2  a newly emerged and highly pathogenic coronavirus  is identified as the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease  2019   COVID-19  in the late December 2019  in China  The virus has rapidly spread nationwide and spilled over to the other countries around the globe  resulting in more than 120 million infections and 2 6 million deaths until the time of this review  Unfortunately  there are still no specific drugs available against this disease  and it is very necessary to call upon more scientists to work together to stop a further spread  Hence  the recent progress in the development of drugs may help scientific community quickly understand current research status and further develop new effective drugs  Herein  we summarize the cellular entry and replication process of this virus and discuss the recent development of potential viral based drugs that target bio-macromolecules in different stages of the viral life cycle  especially S protein  3CL Pro   PL Pro   RdRp and helicase,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870155
6314,Preliminary studies also show that many of the fatalities of COVID-19 are due to over-activity of the immune system  and photobiomodulation  PBM  therapy mainly accelerates wound healing and reduces pain and inflammation  Therefore  this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the probable effect of the PBM therapy on the lung inflammation or ARDS and accelerate the regeneration of the damaged tissue  We systematically searched major indexing databases  including PubMed Medline  ISI web of science  WOS   Scopus  Embase  and Cochrane central  using standard terms without any language  study region  or type restrictions  Of the 438 studies found through initial searches  13 met the inclusion criteria  After applying the exclusion criteria  the main properties of 13 articles on 384 animals included in this meta-analysis with a wide range of species include rat  n   10  and rabbit  n   3   The analysis revealed that PBM therapy reduced TNFalpha  SMD -3 75  95  CI  -4 49  -3 02  P < 0 00001  I 2    10    IL-1beta  SMD -4 65  95  CI  -6 15  -3 16  P < 0 00001  I 2    62    and IL-6  SMD -4 20  95  CI  -6 42  -1 97  P   0 0002  I 2    88   significantly compared with the model controls  Hence  PBM therapy increased IL-10 significantly compared with the model controls  SMD -4 65  95  CI  -6 15  -3 16  P < 0 00001  I 2    62    PBM therapy also reduced MPO activity  SMD -2 13  95  CI  -3 38  -0 87  P   0 0009  I 2    64   and vascular permeability  SMD -2 59  95  CI  -4 40  -0 77  P   0 0052  I 2    71   in the lung using the Evans blue extravasation technique significantly compared with the model controls  This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that the PBM therapy does utilize beneficial anti-inflammatory effect  modulation of the immune system  lung permeability  or bronchoalveolar lavage on lung damage in both animal models and clinical studies  However  animal model and clinical studies appear limited considering the quality of the included evidences  therefore  large clinical trials are still required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907516
4629,Severe mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from the lack of effective treatment  Although COVID-19 vaccines are available  their side effects have become a challenge for clinical use in patients with chronic diseases  especially cancer patients  In the current report  we applied network pharmacology and systematic bioinformatics to explore the use of biochanin A in patients with colorectal cancer  CRC  and COVID-19 infection  Using the network pharmacology approach  we identified two clusters of genes involved in immune response  IL1A  IL2  and IL6R  and cell proliferation  CCND1  PPARG  and EGFR  mediated by biochanin A in CRC COVID-19 condition  The functional analysis of these two gene clusters further illustrated the effects of biochanin A on interleukin-6 production and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction in CRC COVID-19 pathology  In addition  pathway analysis demonstrated the control of PI3K-Akt and JAK-STAT signaling pathways by biochanin A in the treatment of CRC COVID-19  The findings of this study provide a therapeutic option for combination therapy against COVID-19 infection in CRC patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931923
706,Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs-often called misinformation or disinformation-through a population has never seemed so urgent  Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists  and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network  However  absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual s set of current beliefs  where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection  Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition  but they often lack the strengths of network science  namely in empirically-driven network structures  We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion  POD  model  adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades  We show that the model  even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study  dissonance and exposure   adds expressive power over existing cascade models  We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns  We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls  and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs  The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand  and hopefully learn how to best counter  the spread of disinformation and  alternative facts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995299
2569,Control of the COVID-19 pandemic requires significant changes in people s health behaviors  We offer this multidisciplinary perspective on the extent of compliance with social distancing recommendations and on coping with these measures around the globe in the first months of the pandemic  We present descriptive data from our survey of 17 650 respondents across 18 countries and territories in June 2020  The majority of respondents worried about contracting the virus  Nearly all engaged in at least some preventive behaviors  particularly handwashing  mask wearing  and avoiding social events  Most reported that it would be difficult to continue these behaviors for more than a few months  and about half reported feeling more anxious since the start of the pandemic  Commonly reported coping behaviors included news consumption  watching television  and sleeping  Our cross-national study highlights areas for developing and implementing health behavior interventions in the global fight to stop the spread of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963359
9920,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health systems in both developed and developing nations alike  Africa has one of the weakest health systems globally  but there is limited evidence on how the region is prepared for  impacted by and responded to the pandemic  METHODS  We conducted a scoping review of PubMed  Scopus  CINAHL to search peer-reviewed articles and Google  Google Scholar and preprint sites for grey literature  The scoping review captured studies on either preparedness or impacts or responses associated with COVID-19 or covering one or more of the three topics and guided by Arksey and O Malley s methodological framework  The extracted information was documented following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension checklist for scoping reviews  Finally  the resulting data were thematically analysed  RESULTS  Twenty-two eligible studies  of which 6 reported on health system preparedness  19 described the impacts of COVID-19 on access to general and essential health services and 7 focused on responses taken by the healthcare systems were included  The main setbacks in health system preparation included lack of available health services needed for the pandemic  inadequate resources and equipment  and limited testing ability and surge capacity for COVID-19  Reduced flow of patients and missing scheduled appointments were among the most common impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic  Health system responses identified in this review included the availability of telephone consultations  re-purposing of available services and establishment of isolation centres  and provisions of COVID-19 guidelines in some settings  CONCLUSIONS  The health systems in Africa were inadequately prepared for the pandemic  and its impact was substantial  Responses were slow and did not match the magnitude of the problem  Interventions that will improve and strengthen health system resilience and financing through local  national and global engagement should be prioritised,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853031
199,INTRODUCTION  Healthcare workers are at an increased risk of infectious disease transmission through occupational exposure  Despite this  rates of personal protective equipment  PPE  use vary among healthcare personnel  This cross-sectional study surveyed healthcare workers at a single academic center to determine how the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic affected the perceptions and behaviors of PPE usage  METHODS  An anonymous online survey through the SurveyMonkey R  tool  Zendesk Inc   San Francisco  California  was sent to the University of California  Irvine  Medical Center department listserv of nurses on March 20  2021  and was closed on June 20  2021  RESULTS  Of 311 respondents  23  admitted to suffering a splash injury to the face during a procedure  When compared to one year ago prior to the COVID-19 pandemic  PPE was more important  93  vs  80   and more frequently used  80  vs  54   by respondents  The recent COVID-19 pandemic had the strongest impact on increasing respondents  perception of the importance of PPE  44    CONCLUSION  The COVID-19 pandemic positively impacted rates of PPE usage and perceptions of the importance of PPE among healthcare workers at a single academic institution  Implementing clear and effective education and training programs  ensuring adequate access to protective gear  and promoting a positive safety climate can help improve adherence to safety protocols and appropriate use of PPE,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004067
6804,The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic has triggered adiscussion of the relationship between urbanization and the spread of infectious diseases  Namely  whether urbanization will exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases  Based on 31 provincial data from 2002 to 2018 in China  the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases from the dimensions of  population  and  land  is analyzed in this paper by using the GMM  generalized method of moments  model  The empirical study shows that the population increase brought by urbanization does not aggravate the spread of infectious diseases  On the contrary  urban education  employment and entrepreneurship  housing  medical and health care  and other basic public services brought by population urbanization can help reduce the risk of the spread of infectious diseases  The increasing density of buildings caused by land urbanization increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases  Moreover  the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases has regional heterogeneity  Therefore  the prevention and control of disease play a crucial role,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900884
3646,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  many nursing students are being taught remotely  Remote learning has drawbacks  such as decreased motivation for learning and difficulties conveying the instructor s intentions  Strategies that compensate for the shortcomings of remote learning should be identified  This study aimed to evaluate the understanding of the knowledge use and awareness of negotiation methods through cases and teaching tools in nursing student classes on environmental assessment and daily life support  and to examine whether supplementary assistance can compensate for the drawbacks of remote learning  This study used a mixed-method design  and included 59 second-year nursing students attending an environmental assessment course in 2021  Students  knowledge use and awareness of negotiation methods were evaluated using self-assessment worksheets before and after the class  The pre- and post-class scores were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test  The mean knowledge score increased significantly during the study period  p < 0 001   Students acquired awareness of how to use the knowledge gained during class and negotiation awareness by observing role play  factors that strengthen motivation when learning alone  This study provides insight into the potential of class supplements to compensate for the deficits of remote learning  Supplementing the shortcomings of remote learning should be a priority and may be a focal point of hybrid learning,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948516
1791,Since early 2020  the world has been afflicted with an unprecedented global pandemic  The SARS-CoV-19  COVID-19  has levied massive economic and public health costs across many countries  Due to its virulence  the pathogen is rapidly propagating throughout the world in such a way that makes it incredibly challenging for officials to contain its spread  Therefore  there is a pressing need for national and local authorities to have tools that aid in their ability to assess and extrapolate the future trends of the spread of COVID-19  so they may make rational and informed decisions that minimize public harm  Mechanistic models are prominent mathematical tools that are used to characterize epidemics  In this paper  we propose a generalized mechanistic model with eight states characterizing the COVID-19 pandemic evolution from a susceptible state to discharged states while passing by quarantined and hospitalized states  The parameters of the model are determined by solving a fitting optimization problem with three observed inputs  the number of infected  deceased  and reported cases  The model s objective function is weighted over the training days so as to guide the fitting algorithm towards the latest pandemic period and lead to more accurate trend predictions for a stronger forecast  We solve the fitting problem with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm  we compare the performance of the model generated from this algorithm to the one of another state-of-the-art fitting algorithm as well as to the one of another compartmental model widely used in literature  We test the model on the COVID-19 data from four highly afflicted countries  The fitting algorithm has been validated graphically and through numerical metrics  and results show significantly accurate results for most of the countries  Once the model s parameters are estimated  forecasting results are derived and uncertainty regions of the expected scenarios are provided,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976570
3370,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  belongs to the coronavirus family and is characterized by its high transmission competence  Elderly COVID-19 patients are at significantly higher risk of severe course of disease and death  Therefore  outbreaks in nursing homes are particularly challenging for facility managers and health authorities  Here  we report three outbreaks of COVID-19 related to nursing homes  NH01 a  NH02 and NH03  with almost 1000 affected individuals during the first COVID-19 wave in Berlin  Germany  The occurrence of cases and the measures taken were analyzed retrospectively  In all three outbreaks  the index persons were nursing home employees or volunteers  Measures taken were quarantine of contacts  close-meshed tests  separation of the affected housing unit  suspension of admission  ban on visiting  and equipping staff with personal protective equipment  of which there was a shortage in Germany at the beginning of the pandemic  A court-ordered quarantine became necessary for three residents of NH01 a due to cognitive disabilities  In total  61 persons were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in NH01 a  ten persons in NH02  and sixteen persons in NH03  Seventeen patients  27 9   of NH01 a and three patients  18 8   of NH03 were referred to hospital  Of all confirmed cases  thirteen  21 3   related to NH01 a and four  25 0   related to NH03 died as a result of the infection  Besides one 82 year old volunteer  all deceased persons were residents aged between 66 and 98  Our results emphasize the importance of a previously developed containment and cluster strategy for nursing homes  Due to the particular vulnerability of the residents  immediate action  close cooperation and communication between the facility management  residents  visitors and the health authorities are essential in the case of confirmed COVID-19 cases in healthcare facilities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952921
743,PURPOSE  The aim of the study was to determine the effects of workload on the styles of anger expression and  trait anger  of health professionals working in a COVID-19 pandemic hospital  DESIGN AND METHODS  This descriptive study was carried out at a COVID-19 pandemic hospital in Turkey  The sampling consisted of 493 healthcare professionals  The data were evaluated with the SPSS  23 0  software program  FINDINGS  The study found that the participants who perceived the workload as higher  and could not tolerate the work they performed  were high in  trait anger  levels and their anger was suppressed  PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS  Health institutions should consider the recognition of emotional risks and the planning of interventions as a priority for professionals involved in the care of COVID-19 infected patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994410
7301,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic poses challenges for timely outcome assessment in randomized clinical trials  RCT   Our aim was to describe our remote neurocognitive testing  NCT  protocol administered by telephone in patients with Parkinson s disease  PD  and obstructive sleep apnea  OSA   METHODS  We studied PD patients with OSA and Montreal Cognitive Assessment  MoCA  score <   27 participating in a RCT assessing OSA treatment impact on cognition  Trial outcomes included change in MoCA and specific cognitive domains from baseline to 3 and 6 months  With COVID19 pandemic-related restrictions  3-month visits were converted from in-person to telephone administration with materials mailed to participants for compatible tests and retrieved by courier the same day  In exploratory analyses  we compared baseline vs  3-month results in the control arm  which were not expected to change significantly  test-re-test   using a paired t-test and assessed agreement with the intraclass correlation coefficient  ICC   RESULTS  Seven participants were approached and agreed to remote NCT at 3-month follow-up  Compared to the in-person NCT control arm group  they were younger  60 6 versus 70 6 years  and had a shorter disease course  3 9 versus 9 2 years   Remote NCT data were complete  The mean test-retest difference in MoCA was similar for in-person and remote NCT control-arm groups  between group difference - 0 69  95 CI - 3 67  2 29   Agreement was good for MOCA and varied for specific neurocognitive tests  CONCLUSION  Telephone administration of the MoCA and a modified neurocognitive battery is feasible in patients with PD and OSA  Further validation will require a larger sample size,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895299
1412,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  a global health threat  was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The SARS-CoV-2 papain-like cysteine protease  PLpro  was recognized as a promising drug target because of multiple functions in virus maturation and antiviral immune responses  Inhibitor GRL0617 occupied the interferon-stimulated gene 15  ISG15  C-terminus-binding pocket and showed an effective antiviral inhibition  Here  we described a novel peptide-drug conjugate  PDC   in which GRL0617 was linked to a sulfonium-tethered peptide derived from PLpro-specific substrate LRGG  The EM-C and EC-M PDCs showed a promising in vitro IC50 of 7 40   - 0 37 and 8 63   - 0 55 muM  respectively  EC-M could covalently label PLpro active site C111 and display anti-ISGylation activities in cellular assays  The results represent the first attempt to design PDCs composed of stabilized peptide inhibitors and GRL0617 to inhibit PLpro  These novel PDCs provide promising opportunities for antiviral drug design,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981929
9105,There has been an increasing interest in the relationship between religion and psychosocial functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic  Interestingly  emerging recent findings suggest that religiousness may have a Janus-face impact on how people cope with the pandemic  leading to both positive and negative social outcomes  In this project  we examine whether two types of religiousness  i e   centrality of religiosity and religious fundamentalism  are associated with COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and socially undesirable behavior during the pandemic  We suggest that only the most dogmatic and fundamentalistic type of religiousness could lead to conspiracy beliefs  while centrality of religiosity could be unrelated or even negatively related to this type of thinking  In a series of two studies  N   361 and N   394  conducted among Polish Roman Catholics  we demonstrate that religious fundamentalism  unlike centrality of religiosity  is positively related to coronavirus conspiracy beliefs  which  in turn  promote socially maladaptive behavior such as freeriding or non-adherence to safety guidelines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866726
4265,It is not fully understood why COVID-19 is typically milder in children 1-3   To examine differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adults  we analysed paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients and healthy controls  total n 93  using single-cell multi-omic profiling of matched nasal  tracheal  bronchial and blood samples  In healthy paediatric airways  we observed cells already in an interferon-activated state  that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection was further induced especially in airway immune cells  We postulate that higher paediatric innate interferon-responses restrict viral replication and disease progression  The systemic response in children was characterised by increases in naive lymphocytes and a depletion of natural killer cells  while in adults cytotoxic T cells and interferon-stimulated subpopulations were significantly increased  We provide evidence that dendritic cells initiate interferon signaling in early infection  and identify novel epithelial cell states that associate with COVID-19 and age  Our matching nasal and blood data showed a strong interferon response in the airways with the induction of systemic interferon-stimulated populations  which were massively reduced in paediatric patients  Together  we provide several mechanisms that explain the milder clinical syndrome observed in children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937051
6848,Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic  the scientific and public health communities have become increasingly focused on understanding young adults  physical distancing behaviors and the role that young adults have on viral potentiation and community spread  In the present study  we surveyed a group of 560 young adults  ages 22-28  from the greater Seattle area in April 2020  during statewide  shelter-in-place  recommendations  to examine young adults  self-reported adherence to physical distancing guidelines  Self-report measures were used to identify strong adherers and poor adherers  which we then compared in terms of engagement in specific physical distancing behaviors and alcohol use behaviors pertaining to physical distancing adherence  We found that most young adults are classified as strong adherers  and that poor adherers reported more frequent violations of physical distancing guidelines including having friends over to their residence or going over to other residences  Poor adherers were also significantly more likely to engage in high-risk alcohol use behavior  such as heavy episodic drinking  compared to those young adults who were classified as strong adherers  Our results provide initial evidence that young adults who engage in high-risk drinking may be at greater risk for non-adherence to government recommended physical distancing guidelines  This deeper understanding of young adult behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic can better inform public health outreach to increase physical distancing adherence currently  as well as in preparation for future contagious health crises that may require societal-level adherence to behavioral guidelines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900404
828,Viral infections account for up to 30  of all infectious complications in lung transplant recipients  remaining a significant cause of morbidity and even mortality  Impact of viral infections is not only due to the direct effects of viral replication  but also to immunologically-mediated lung injury that may lead to acute rejection and chronic lung allograft dysfunction  This has particularly been seen in infections caused by herpesviruses and respiratory viruses  The implementation of universal preventive measures against cytomegalovirus  CMV  and influenza  by means of antiviral prophylaxis and vaccination  respectively  and administration of early antiviral treatment have reduced the burden of these diseases and potentially their role in affecting allograft outcomes  New antivirals against CMV for prophylaxis and for treatment of antiviral-resistant CMV infection are currently being evaluated in transplant recipients  and may continue to improve the management of CMV in lung transplant recipients  However  new therapeutic and preventive strategies are highly needed for other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  or parainfluenza virus  PIV   including new antivirals and vaccines  This is particularly important in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic  for which several unanswered questions remain  in particular on the best antiviral and immunomodulatory regimen for decreasing mortality specifically in lung transplant recipients  In conclusion  the appropriate management of viral complications after transplantation remain an essential step to continue improving survival and quality of life of lung transplant recipients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992844
6127,BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  cases were first reported in December 2019  in China  and an increasing number of cases have since been detected all over the world  The purpose of this study was to collect significant news media reports on food services during the COVID-19 crisis and identify public communication and significant concerns regarding COVID-19 for suggesting future directions for the food industry and services  SUBJECTS METHODS  News articles pertaining to food services were extracted from the home pages of major news media websites such as BBC  CNN  and Fox News between March 2020 and February 2021  The retrieved data was sorted and analyzed using Python software  RESULTS  The results of text analytics were presented in the format of the topic label and category for individual topics  The food and health category presented the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food and health  such as an increase in delivery services  The policy category was indicative of a change in government policy  The lifestyle change category addressed topics such as an increase in social media usage  CONCLUSIONS  This study is the first to analyze major news media  i e   BBC  CNN  and Fox News  data related to food services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  Text analytics research on the food services domain revealed different categories such as food and health  policy  and lifestyle change  Therefore  this study contributes to the body of knowledge on food services research  through the use of text analytics to elicit findings from media sources,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909137
1582,BACKGROUND  Chest computed tomography  CT  is crucial in the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   However  the persistent pandemic and similar CT manifestations between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia  CAP  raise methodological requirements  METHODS  A fully automatic pipeline of deep learning is proposed for distinguishing COVID-19 from CAP using CT images  Inspired by the diagnostic process of radiologists  the pipeline comprises four connected modules for lung segmentation  selection of slices with lesions  slice-level prediction  and patient-level prediction  The roles of the first and second modules and the effectiveness of the capsule network for slice-level prediction were investigated  A dataset of 326 CT scans was collected to train and test the pipeline  Another public dataset of 110 patients was used to evaluate the generalization capability  RESULTS  LinkNet exhibited the largest intersection over union  0 967  and Dice coefficient  0 983  for lung segmentation  For the selection of slices with lesions  the capsule network with the ResNet50 block achieved an accuracy of 92 5  and an area under the curve  AUC  of 0 933  The capsule network using the DenseNet121 block demonstrated better performance for slice-level prediction  with an accuracy of 97 1  and AUC of 0 992  For both datasets  the prediction accuracy of our pipeline was 100  at the patient level  CONCLUSIONS  The proposed fully automatic deep learning pipeline of deep learning can distinguish COVID-19 from CAP via CT images rapidly and accurately  thereby accelerating diagnosis and augmenting the performance of radiologists  This pipeline is convenient for use by radiologists and provides explainable predictions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979404
5815,BACKGROUND  Global burden of disease  GBD  provides the estimates of mortality and morbidity  while case fatality rate  CFR  helps in understanding the severity of the disease  People infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS CoV-2  with underlying medical conditions have shown higher levels of unfavorable outcomes including mortality  We assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 CFR with disability-adjusted life years  DALY  of various comorbidities in the low-middle income countries  LMIC  and high-income countries  HIC  to study the relationship of coronavirus disease-19  COVID-19  mortality with GBDs and to understand the linkage between COVID-19 mortality and comorbidities  MATERIALS AND METHODS  This was an ecological study with secondary data analysis comparing the DALY of various morbidities from GBD with CFR of COVID-19  Gross domestic product was the basis of stratifying 177 countries into low-middle income  LMIC  and high-income groups  HIC   The mortality was analyzed using Pearson correlation and linear regression  RESULTS  The median global CFR of SARS-CoV-2 was 2 15  The median CFR among LMIC  n   60  and HIC  n   117  was 2 01  0 00-28 20  and 2 29  0 00-17 26   respectively  The regression analysis found that  in both LMIC and HIC  maternal disorders were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 CFR  while tuberculosis  mental health disorders  and were associated with lower CFR  Further  in LMIC  musculoskeletal disorders and nutritional deficiencies were associated with higher CFR  while respiratory disorders were associated with lower CFR  CONCLUSIONS  SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a systemic disease  Individuals with comorbidities  such as maternal disorders  neurological diseases  musculoskeletal disorders  and nutritional deficiencies  have poorer outcomes with COVID-19  leading to higher mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912913
291,In this study  peptide entry inhibitors against the fusion processes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SCV2  and influenza A virus  IAV  were designed and evaluated  Fusion inhibitor peptides targeting the conformational shift of the viral fusion protein were designed based on the relatively conserved sequence of HR2 from SCV2 spike protein and the conserved fusion peptide from hemagglutinin  HA  of IAV  Helical HR2 peptides bind more efficiently to HR1 trimer  while helical amphipathic anti-IAV peptides have higher cell penetration and endosomal uptake  The initial sequences were mutated by increasing the amphipathicity  using helix favoring residues  and residues likely to form salt- and disulfide-bridges  After docking against their targets  all anti-SCV2 designed peptides bonded with the HR1 3-helical bundle s hydrophobic crevice  while AntiSCV2P1  AntiSCV2P3  AntiSCV2P7  and AntiSCV2P8 expected to form coiled coils with at least one of the HR1 strands  Four of the designed anti-IAV peptides were cell-penetrating  AntiIAVP2  AntiIAVP3  AntiIAVP4  AntiIAVP7   All of them interacted with the fusion peptide of HA and some of the residues in the conserved hydrophobic pocket of HA2 in H1N1  H3N1  and H5N1 subtypes of IAV  AntiIAVP3 and AntiIAVP4 peptides had the best binding to HA2 conserved hydrophobic pocket  while  AntiIAVP2 and AntiIAVP6 showed the best binding to the fusion peptide region  According to analyses for in-vivo administration  AntiSCV2P1  AntiSCV2P7  AntiIAVP2  and AntiIAVP7 were the best candidates  AntiSCV2 and AntiIAV peptides were also conjugated using an in vivo cleavable linker sensitive to TMPRSS2 applicable as a single therapeutic in coinfections or uncertain diagnosis  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s10989-021-10357-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002586
2458,The COVID-19 outbreak has caused two waves and spread to more than 90  of Canada s provinces since it was first reported more than a year ago  During the COVID-19 epidemic  Canadian provinces have implemented many Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions  NPIs   However  the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic continues due to the complex dynamics of human mobility  We develop a meta-population network model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19  The model takes into account the heterogeneity of mitigation strategies in different provinces of Canada  such as the timing of implementing NPIs  the human mobility in retail and recreation  grocery and pharmacy  parks  transit stations  workplaces  and residences due to work and recreation  To determine which activity is most closely related to the dynamics of COVID-19  we use the cross-correlation analysis to find that the positive correlation is the highest between the mobility data of parks and the weekly number of confirmed COVID-19 from February 15 to December 13  2020  The average effective reproduction numbers in nine Canadian provinces are all greater than one during the time period  and NPIs have little impact on the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics in Ontario and Saskatchewan  After November 20  2020  the average infection probability in Alberta became the highest since the start of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada  We also observe that human activities around residences do not contribute much to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic  The simulation results indicate that social distancing and constricting human mobility is effective in mitigating COVID-19 transmission in Canada  Our findings can provide guidance for public health authorities in projecting the effectiveness of future NPIs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965272
9962,OBJECTIVES  Ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsies  MIA-US  are an alternative to conventional autopsies and have been used in our institution to investigate the pathophysiology of COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic  Owing to the limitations of post-mortem biopsies for evaluating cardiopulmonary events involving large vessels  we continuously improved the technique during this period  Objectives  To demonstrate the usefulness of an extended MIA-US technique  EMIA-US  for the study of thoracic involvement in COVID-19  METHOD  US-guided percutaneous tissue sampling was combined with a small thoracic incision  <  5 cm   allowing for the sampling of larger tissue samples or even the entire organ  lungs and heart   RESULTS  EMIA-US was performed for eight patients who died of COVID-19 in 2021  We demonstrate cardiopulmonary events  mainly thromboembolism and myocardial infarction  that could be evaluated using EMIA-US  CONCLUSIONS  Minimally invasive image-guided post-mortem tissue sampling is a flexible and practical method to conduct post-mortem studies of human diseases  mainly in areas that do not have autopsy facilities or  alternatively  when autopsy is not possible owing to financial constraints  cultural and religious values  or for safety reasons  such as in the case of highly contagious infectious diseases  We present evidence that EMIA-US is feasible and can be used as an alternative to increase the accuracy of MIA-US in detecting cardiopulmonary events involving large vessels  which may not be assessed through post-mortem biopsies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852147
6338,BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE  COVID-19 pandemic  a global health crisis  is disrupting the present medical environment  This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stroke hospitalisations  especially haemorrhagic stroke  METHODS  The EMBASE  PubMed  Web of Science  Elsevier  Medline  Cochrane Library and Google Scholar electronic databases were searched for all relevant studies  Two researchers independently screened the studies  extracted data and assessed the quality of the included studies  Odds ratio  OR   total events  OR and 95  CI were considered as the effect size  A fixed-effects model was used to pool the study-specific estimate  The present study was performed by using Review Manager  V 5 3 0  software  We assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale  RESULTS  A total of 17 studies with 14 445 cases were included  Overall  the number of stroke admissions is lower in the pandemic period versus the control period  6252 vs 8193   The difference of haemorrhagic stroke is significant  with 1233 of 6252 cases in the pandemic group and 1621 of 8193 cases in the control group  Intracerebral haemorrhage is present in 461 of 1948 cases in the pandemic group and 618 of 2734 cases in the control group  As for subarachnoid haemorrhage  the difference between the two groups is significant  with 70 of 985 cases in the pandemic group and 202 of 1493 cases in the control group  CONCLUSIONS  The number of stroke admissions is lower in the pandemic period compared with the control period  There is a higher rate of haemorrhagic stroke in the pandemic period  Subgroup analysis identifies a significant increase in the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage in the pandemic period  Due to limited data and the impact of a single article  the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on subarachnoid haemorrhage is unclear,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907050
9875,The severity of COVID-19 is age-related  with the advantage going to younger age-groups  Five reasons are presented  The first two are well-known  are being actively researched by the broader medical community  and therefore are discussed only briefly here  The third  fourth and fifth reasons derive from evolutionary life history theory  and potentially fill gaps in current understanding of why and how young and old age-groups respond differently to infection with SARS-CoV-2  Age of onset of generalized somatic aging and the timing of its progression are identified as important causes of these disparities  as are specific antagonistic pleiotropic tradeoffs in immune system function  Lay Summary  Covid-19 is less severe in younger age-groups than it is in older age-groups  Five advantages of youth are identified and explained in light of evolutionary life history theory  with a focus on the pattern of aging and specific tradeoffs between early and late immune system function,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853694

4617,BACKGROUND  This study aimed to evaluate the patterns of firearm violence against children before and after the COVID-19 pandemic  as well as the patterns of specific types of firearm violence against children over time  2016-2020   METHODS  Retrospective firearm violence data were obtained from the Gun Violence Archive  The rate of firearm violence was weighted per 100 000 children  A scatterplot was created to depict the rate of total annual child-involved shooting incidents over time  with a linear trendline fit to 2016 to 2019 data to show projected versus actual 2020 firearm violence  All 50 states were categorized into either  strong gun law   n   25  or  weak gun law   n   25  cohorts  Multivariate linear regressions were performed for number of child-involved shootings over time  RESULTS  There were a total of 1 076 child-involved shootings in 2020  811 in 2019  and 803 in 2018  The median total child-involved shooting incidents per month per 100 000 children increased from 2018 to 2020  0 095 vs  0 124  p   0 003  and from 2019 to 2020  0 097 vs  0 124  p   0 010   Child killed by adult incidents also increased in 2020 compared with 2018  p   0 024  and 2019  p   0 049   The scatterplot demonstrates that total child-involved shootings in addition to both fatal and nonfatal firearm violence incidents exceeded the projected number of incidents extrapolated from 2016 to 2019 data  Multivariate linear regression demonstrated that  compared with weak gun law states  strong gun law states were associated with decreased monthly total child-involved shooting incidents between 2018 and 2020  p < 0 001   as well as between 2019 and 2020  p < 0 001   CONCLUSION  Child-involved shooting incidents increased significantly in 2020 surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic  Given that gun law strength was associated with a decreased rate of monthly child-involved firearm violence  public health and legislative efforts should be made to protect this vulnerable population from exposure to firearms  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE  Epidemiological  level III,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932041
8777,The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing service delivery interruptions had serious impacts on people who use drugs  PWUD  and people experiencing homelessness  including instability in the drug supply  decreased access to substance use disorder  SUD  treatment and harm reduction supplies  increased substance use and relapse due to stress and isolation  inability to properly isolate and quarantine without stable housing  and risk of COVID-19 spread in congregate living spaces  At the same time  many have noted a potential opportunity for rapid change in health  housing  and drug policy despite previous stagnation-referred to as a  punctuated equilibrium  by Baumgartner and Jones-in response to the pandemic  The pandemic forced some important policy interventions in the United States at both national and local levels  including eviction moratoriums and loosening of drug policy related to substance use treatment  However  to what extent some of these changes will be sustained past the current COVID-19 crisis is still unclear  as is how drug and housing related policy shifts have impacted the work of frontline overdose prevention  substance use treatment  and homelessness advocacy workers  In this qualitative study  we used semi-structured interviews to assess how Philadelphia s harm reduction advocates  community organizers  and SUD treatment clinicians have responded to the overdose and homelessness crises during COVID-19  and how they predict the pandemic and ensuing policy changes will impact the future of overdose prevention  harm reduction efforts  and homelessness advocacy  We interviewed 30 eligible participants during July and August 2020  The analysis of these data yielded three themes  1  None of it should be new to anybody   COVID-era issues impacting PWUD and people experiencing homelessness are extensions of existing problems  2  An opportunity to actually benefit in some way from this crisis   Possibility for innovation and improved care for PWUD and people experiencing homelessness  and 3  Nothing we ve tried has worked  so we have to be uncomfortable and creative   The uncertain path forward  Despite the many barriers that participants faced to promoting the health and well-being of marginalized communities during the pandemic  they also believed that the pandemic presented an important opportunity for positive policy change that has the potential to promote drug user health into the future  including a continuation of loosened federal restrictions on substance use disorder treatment  legalization of safe consumption spaces  safe supply of substances  and progressive  creative housing solutions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870265
6625,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted how an emergent disease can spread globally and how vaccines are once again the most important public health policy to combat infectious disease  Despite promising initial protection  the rise of new viral variants calls into question how effective current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be moving forward  Improving on vaccine platforms represents an opportunity to stay ahead of SARS-CoV-2 and keep the human population protected  Many researchers focus on modifying delivery platforms or altering the antigen s  presented to improve the efficacy of the vaccines  Identifying mechanisms of natural immunity that result in the control of infection and prevent poor clinical outcomes provides an alternative approach to the development of efficacious vaccines  Early and current evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection is marked by potent lung inflammation and relatively diminished antiviral signaling which leads to impaired immune recognition and viral clearance  essentially making SARS-CoV-2  too hot to handle,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902803
4963,One of the restrictive measures of COVID-19  coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic control is the prohibition of accompanied clinic visits  The specific features of ophthalmological patients imply different degrees of dependency that directly affect their response to such measures  This study aims to assess the effects of unaccompanied medical appointments on outpatients  stress levels and their retention of medical advice  A questionnaire-based survey was conducted at a large ophthalmic clinic in northern Greece during September 2020  Suitable subjects were asked to self-administer a 7-item questionnaire addressing their subjective perception of stress and their ability to fully understand and remember their doctor s instructions  given the fact that they would be alone during the consultation  The analysis was based on 200 patients who completed the survey  Sixty-three patients  31 5   reported that unaccompanied clinic visits increased their stress  with a median value of 7 5  mean 6 77   -  2 7  on a scale from 1 to 10  A large number of the patients  30   claimed it was difficult to remember the doctor s comments or instructions  and 24 6  indicated that they would not fully understand them if they were to attend the clinic unaccompanied  A marked impact on women and on the elderly  up to threefold  over 70 years of age was identified  This is the first study specifically addressing practical repercussions of unaccompanied clinic visits during the COVID-19 pandemic  A negative effect on patients  emotional status and on counseling effectiveness was demonstrated  Female gender and advanced age were found to be determinants of the highest vulnerability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926802
7548,Inactivated and live attenuated vaccines have improved human life and significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of several human infectious diseases  However  these vaccines have faults  such as reactivity or suboptimal efficacy and expensive and time-consuming development and production  Additionally  despite the enormous efforts to develop vaccines against some infectious diseases  the traditional technologies have not been successful in achieving this  At the same time  the concerns about emerging and re-emerging diseases urge the need to develop technologies that can be rapidly applied to combat the new challenges  Within the last two decades  the research of vaccine technologies has taken several directions to achieve safe  efficient  and economic platforms or technologies for novel vaccines  This review will give a brief overview of the current state of the novel vaccine technologies  new vaccine candidates in clinical trial phases 1-3  listed by European Medicines Agency  EMA  and Food and Drug Administration  FDA    and vaccines based on the novel technologies which have already been commercially available  approved by EMA and FDA  with the special reference to pandemic COVID-19 vaccines  KEY POINTS    Vaccines of the new generation follow the minimalist strategy    Some infectious diseases remain a challenge for the vaccine development    The number of new vaccine candidates in the late phase clinical trials remains low,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889981
4974,At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  early modelling studies estimated a reduction in childhood vaccinations in low- and middle-income countries  Regular provision of both curative and preventive services such as antenatal care and childhood immunizations has been negatively affected since the onset of the pandemic  Our study was aimed at examining the impact that the pandemic had on childhood vaccination services at the Tamale Teaching Hospital  TTH   A mixed methods study design was employed for the study  which was conducted at the Child Welfare Clinic  CWC  of the TTH  With quantitative approach  we retrospectively looked at the uptake of the various vaccines during the pandemic era  defined as the period between 1 st  March 2020 and 28 th  February  2021  and the prepandemic era defined as the period 1 st  March 2019 to 29 th  February  2020  The qualitative approach was used to understand the perspective of five healthcare providers at the CWC and the four caregivers of children who have missed a vaccine or delayed in coming  on the factors accounting for any observed change  Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2016 and thematic content analysis  Quantitative data were presented in frequencies  percentages  and line graphs  With the exception of the Measles Rubella  MR  2 vaccine  we observed a decline ranging from 47   2298  to 10 5   116   with the greatest decline seen in the BCG and the least decline seen in the MR1 vaccine  The month of May 2020 saw the greatest decline  that is  70 6   813   A decline of 38 3   4473  was noted when comparison was made between the designated prepandemic and pandemic eras  for all the vaccines in our study  Fear of COVID-19 infection and misinformation were commonly given as reasons for the decline  Catch-up immunization schedule should be instituted to curtail possible future outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926689
730,OBJECTIVES  To identify which level of D-dimer would allow the safe exclusion of pulmonary embolism  PE  in COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department  ED   METHODS  This retrospective study was conducted on the COVID database of Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris  AP-HP   COVID-19 patients who presented at the ED of AP-HP hospitals between March 1 and May 15  2020  and had CTPA following D-dimer dosage within 48h of presentation were included  The D-dimer sensitivity  specificity  and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for different D-dimer thresholds  as well as the false-negative and failure rates  and the number of CTPAs potentially avoided  RESULTS  A total of 781 patients  mean age 62 0 years  53 8  men  with positive RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 were included and 60 of them  7 7   had CTPA-confirmed PE  Their median D-dimer level was significantly higher than that of patients without PE  4 013 vs 1 198 ng mL -1   p < 0 001   Using 500 ng mL -1   or an age-adjusted cut-off for patients > 50 years  the sensitivity and the NPV were above 90   With these thresholds  17 1  and 31 5  of CTPAs could have been avoided  respectively  Four of the 178 patients who had a D-dimer below the age-adjusted cutoff had PE  leading to an acceptable failure rate of 2 2   Using higher D-dimer cut-offs could have avoided more CTPAs  but would have lowered the sensitivity and increased the failure rate  CONCLUSION  The same D-Dimer thresholds as those validated in non-COVID outpatients should be used to safely rule out PE  KEY POINTS    The median D-dimer level was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with PE as compared to those without PE  4 013 ng mL -1  vs 1 198 ng mL -1  respectively  p < 0 001     Using 500 ng mL -1   or an age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off to exclude pulmonary embolism  the sensitivity and negative predictive value were above 90     Higher cut-offs would lead to a reduction in the sensitivity below 85  and an increase in the failure rate  especially for patients under 50 years,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994845

8957,Background  One of the challenges has been coping with an increasing need for COVID-19 testing  A COVID-19 screening and testing facility was created  There was a need for increasing throughput of the facility within the existing space and limited resources  Discrete event simulation was used to address this challenge  Methodology  A cross-sectional interventional study was done from September 2020 to October 2020  Detailed process mapping with all micro-processes was done  Patient arrival patterns and time taken at each step were measured by two independent observers at random intervals over two weeks  The existing system was simulated and a bottleneck was identified  Two possible alternatives to the problem were simulated and evaluated  Results  Scenario 1 showed a maximum throughput of 316  The average milestone times of all the processes after the step of  Preparation of sampling kits  jumped 62   from 82 to 133 min  Staff state times also showed that staff at this step was stretched and medical lab technicians were underutilized  Scenario 2 simulated the alternative with lesser time spent on sampling kit preparation with a 22 4  increase in throughput  but could have led to impaired quality check  Scenario 3 simulated with increased manpower at the stage of bottleneck with 26 5  increase in throughput and was implemented on-ground  Conclusion  Discrete event simulation helped to identify the bottleneck  simulate possible alternative solutions without disturbing the ongoing work  and finally choose the most suitable intervention to increase throughput  without the need for additional space allocation  It therefore helped to optimally utilize resources and get  more from less,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868613
2802,The management of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a challenging process  especially for low- and middle-income countries  LMICs  due to the serious economic and health resource problems it generates  In this article  we assess COVID-19 situation in LMICs and outline emerging problems and possible solutions  The prevention and control of COVID-19 would be based on focused tests exploiting those systems  e g   GeneXpert  R    already used in other scenarios  This would be less stressful for the healthcare system in LMICs  Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections  frequent handwashing  and avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals are recommended infection control interventions  The appropriate use of personal protective equipment  PPE  is required  despite its procurement being especially difficult in LMICs  Patients  triage should be based on a simple and rapid logarithm to decide who requires isolation and targeted testing for SARS-CoV-2  Being able to estimate which patients will develop severe disease would allow hospitals to better utilize the already limited resources more effectively  In LMICs  laboratories are often in the capital cities  therefore  early diagnosis and isolation become difficult  The number of ICU beds is often insufficient  and the equipment is often old and poorly serviced  LMICs will need access to COVID-19 treatments at minimal prices to ensure that all who need them can be treated  Year-to-date  different vaccines have been approved and are currently available  The main obstacle to accessing them is the limited ability of LMICs to purchase significant quantities of the vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960223
7223,The relation between infections and autoimmune diseases has been extensively investigated  Multiple studies suggest a causal relation between these two entities with molecular mimicry  hyperstimulation and dysregulation of the immune system as plausible mechanisms  The recent pandemic with a new virus  i e   SARS-CoV-2  has resulted in numerous studies addressing the potential of this virus to induce autoimmunity and  eventually  autoimmune disease  In addition  it has also revealed that pre-existing auto-immunity  auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs  could cause life-threatening disease  Therefore  the topic of the 15th Dresden Symposium on Autoantibodies was focused on autoimmunity in the SARS-CoV-2 era  This report is a collection and distillation of the topics presented at this meeting,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896650
6263,Objective  This study examines the relationship between telecommuting and gender inequalities in parents  time use at home and on the job before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  Background  Telecommuting is a potential strategy for addressing the competing demands of work and home and the gendered ways in which they play out  Limited evidence is mixed  however  on the implications of telecommuting for mothers  and fathers  time in paid and unpaid work  The massive increase in telecommuting due to COVID-19 underscores the critical need to address this gap in the literature  Method  Data from the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey  N   12 519  and the 2020 Current Population Survey  N   83 676  were used to estimate the relationship between telecommuting and gender gaps in parents  time in paid and unpaid work before and during the pandemic  Matching and quasi-experimental methods better approximate causal relationships than prior studies  Results  Before the pandemic  telecommuting was associated with larger gender gaps in housework and work disruptions but smaller gender gaps in childcare  particularly among couples with two full-time earners  During the pandemic  telecommuting mothers maintained paid work to a greater extent than mothers working on-site  whereas fathers  work hours did not differ by work location  Conclusion  In the context of weak institutional support for parenting  telecommuting may offer mothers a mechanism for maintaining work hours and reducing gender gaps in childcare  while exacerbating inequalities in housework and disruptions to paid work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908583
2089,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the quality of life of aged care residents living with dementia  RLWD   Lockdown measures necessary to protect RLWD and caring staff from COVID-19 have resulted in increased social isolation  loneliness  and behaviors and psychological symptoms of dementia  BPSD   In response  the Australian Government funded a pilot program  the Dementia Engagement Modelling Program  DEMP  as part of the Aged Care COVID-19 Grief and Trauma support package for RLWD  their families and aged care staff  Operated by the Dementia Centre of HammondCare  the DEMP provides first-line multimodal external support for RLWD at a greater risk of developing BPSD due to COVID-19 restrictions  This study aims to describe the DEMP and evaluate its feasibility and outcomes for Australian RLWD  METHODS  A team of 10 trained DEMP consultants was involved in delivering a consultancy service that modelled best practice and person-centred activities of engagement to support staff in providing residents with meaningful purpose  comfort  and reassurance  Consultants also provided coaching and development opportunities for staff to enhance their knowledge regarding communication and engagement  Outcome measures included the regular administration of the Engagement in Preferred ActivitieS Scale  EPASS  >  4-9 moderate-to-high engagement   A phone evaluation survey for supported residential aged care homes  RACHs  was conducted to determine the feasibility of DEMP  RESULTS  A total of 60 residents  86 0   - 7 8 y  68  female  across 10 RACHs from three Australian states  VIC  NSW  QLD  was supported by DEMP between May and July 2021  More than half of the residents had Alzheimer s disease  n   24  40   and vascular dementia  n   7  12    Completed EPASS assessments  n   389  demonstrated that the vast majority  64 -72   of residents scored moderate-to-high engagement  All supported RACHs highly recommended the DEMP to other colleagues and rated the program highly for implementation feasibility including the recommended engagement activities brokered items  CONCLUSIONS  The DEMP is a novel  feasible and effective dementia-specific engagement modelling program for Australian RLWD in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971109

4328,mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have shown exceptional clinical efficacy  providing robust protection against severe disease  However  our understanding of transcriptional and repertoire changes following full vaccination remains incomplete  We used scRNA-Seq and functional assays to compare humoral and cellular responses to 2 doses of mRNA vaccine with responses observed in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic disease  Our analyses revealed enrichment of spike-specific B cells  activated CD4  T cells  and robust antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4  T cell responses following vaccination  On the other hand  although clonally expanded CD8  T cells were observed following both vaccination and natural infection  CD8  T cell responses were relatively weak and variable  In addition  TCR gene usage was variable  reflecting the diversity of repertoires and MHC polymorphism in the human population  Natural infection induced expansion of CD8  T cell clones that occupy distinct clusters compared to those induced by vaccination and likely recognize a broader set of viral antigens of viral epitopes presented by the virus not seen in the mRNA vaccine  Our study highlights a coordinated adaptive immune response in which early CD4  T cell responses facilitate the development of the B cell response and substantial expansion of effector CD8  T cells  together capable of contributing to future recall responses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935643
6556,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   the causative agent of coronavirus disease  COVID-19   continues to be a pressing health concern  In this study  we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host microRNA  miRNA  populations in three human lung-derived cell lines  as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals  We did not detect any major and consistent differences in host miRNA levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection  However  we unexpectedly discovered a viral miRNA-like small RNA  named CoV2-miR-O7a  for SARS-CoV-2 miRNA-like ORF7a-derived small RNA   Its abundance ranges from low to moderate as compared to host miRNAs and it associates with Argonaute proteins-core components of the RNA interference pathway  We identify putative targets for CoV2-miR-O7a  including Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2  BATF2   which participates in interferon signaling  We demonstrate that CoV2-miR-O7a production relies on cellular machinery  yet is independent of Drosha protein  and is enhanced by the presence of a strong and evolutionarily conserved hairpin formed within the ORF7a sequence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903581
9436,INTRODUCTION  Previous studies have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause psychological distress such as depression and anxiety  Patients with chronic kidney disease  CKD  might be more vulnerable to psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic  Its impact could be different according to dialysis modality  The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by end-stage kidney disease  ESKD  patients and identify differences in concerns about COVID-19 between hemodialysis  HD  and peritoneal dialysis  PD  patients  METHODS  This cross-sectional study included 148 dialysis patients at Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital from August 2020 to September 2020  These patients responded to a questionnaire covering mental health status and COVID-19 related concerns  Symptoms of depression  anxiety  stress  and insomnia were measured using a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire  PHQ-9   a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder  GAD-7  scale  a 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised  IES-R   and a 7-item Insomnia severity Index  ISI   respectively  Outcomes of HD and PD patients were compared by propensity score matching analysis  RESULTS  Dialysis patients reported psychological distress including symptoms of depression  anxiety  stress  and insomnia  HD patients showed higher scores for depression  p   0 018   anxiety p   0 005   stress p<0 001   and insomnia p   0 006  than the PD patients  After propensity score matching  HD was associated with depression p   0 0131   anxiety p   0 0143   and stress p   0 000415   CONCLUSION  Dialysis patients showed psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic period  with HD patients having more severe symptoms than PD patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860844
8715,Background  There are conflicting data with regard to the impact of respiratory and allergic comorbidities on the course of novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  in children  Objective  This study aimed to investigate the relationship between allergic diseases and COVID-19 severity in pediatric patients  Methods  Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved  Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E  IgE  levels  and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed  Results  A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated  COVID-19 was asymptomatic mild in 44 patients and moderate severe critical in 31 patients  Based on allergy evaluation  allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients  25 3    asthma in 10 patients  13    and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients  4    Aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in 26 patients  34 7    COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic mild in 15 patients with allergic rhinitis  78 9   and in 21 with aeroallergen sensitivity  80 8    p   0 038 and p   0 005  respectively   There was no difference in severity between the patients with and without asthma  p   0 550   The median  interquartile range  total IgE level was significantly higher in the asymptomatic mild group  71 8  30 7-211 2    p   0 015   There were no differences in terms of spirometry parameters  Conclusion  Aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis in children may be associated with a milder course of COVID-19  The knowledge that atopy is associated with less-severe COVID-19 outcomes in children may guide clinical risk classification,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871160
7267,Immunotherapy with convalescent plasma  CP  has been used in the past in several different infectious diseases and proposed as a potential therapeutic option in patients with COVID-19  However  a clear benefit was never demonstrated and randomized clinical trials  RCTs  conducted in different populations of COVID-19 patients showed contrasting results  In general  current evidences suggest that CP in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 does not reduce the progression to severe respiratory failure or death within 30 days  However  currently published RCTs have several limitations  The administration of plasma with low titer of neutralizing antibodies  NAbs   the use of suboptimal surrogate serological tests to determine NAbs titer  the delayed administration of CP from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the lack of information about antibody titer of recipients before CP infusion  are all limiting factors that may have affected the study results  Thus  a potential benefit of early  within the first 72 h from onset of symptoms   high titer CP in patients with mild COVID-19  pO2 FiO2>300  cannot be definitively excluded  However  immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies developed from CP demonstrated efficacy in reducing progression to severe COVID-19 and hospitalization and are today recommended in the early phase of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895816
3319,An early report during the SARS-CoV-2  COVID-19  outbreak noted myocardial involvement with cardiac troponin I  cTnI  levels >99 th  percentile in approximately 20  of hospitalized patients  Patients with cTnI elevations had higher in-hospital mortality  Additionally  myocarditis is associated with exercise-related sudden cardiac death in athletes  Therefore  reports of COVID-19 myocarditis concerned the sports cardiology community  which issued two guidelines on managing athletes with COVID-19 infection  We reviewed reports of myocardial involvement in athletes after COVID-19 infection published before June 2021  The incidence of the diagnosis of myocarditis in athletes post-COVID-19 ranged from 0 to 15 4  based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  cMRI  performed 10 to 194 days after initial diagnosis of COVID-19  Only a few studies adhered to accepted myocarditis diagnostic guidelines and only two studies included a control group of uninfected athletes  There was significant heterogeneity in the method and protocols used in evaluating athletes post-COVID-19  The incidence of COVID-19 myocarditis in athletes appears to be over-diagnosed  The evaluation of myocarditis post-COVID-19 should be individually performed and managed according to the current guidelines  This can potentially prevent needless training restrictions and the inability to participate in competitive sports,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954013
6855,Aim  This study aimed to determine the compliance of healthcare workers  HCWs  with the hospital safety measures and the prevalence of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection among them  Methodology  HCWs at King Abdullah University Hospital  KAUH  assigned for COVID-19 patients between 18 March and 10 June 2020 were tested for past infection using total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin assay  demographic data and compliance with safety measures were assessed using a questionnaire  Results  A total of 340 HCWs participated in the study  260 were close direct care  Three HCWs tested positive for total anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin  Close direct care were more compliant with personal protective guidelines than those providing direct care  Conclusion  HCWs compliance with personal protective guidelines might explain the low prevalence of COVID-19 infection in hospital settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900337
2404,PURPOSE OF REVIEW  One important question from the outset of the pandemic has been whether a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -infected person s milk might be a vehicle for SARS-CoV-2 transmission  This review summarizes the most recent data on this topic  RECENT FINDINGS  A SARS-CoV-2 sIgA response in milk after infection is very common  To date  there has been no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via human milk  Though viral RNA has been identified in a minority of milk samples studied  infectious virus particles have not  SUMMARY  The highly dominant transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 is via inhalation of respiratory droplets containing virus particles  Other routes of transmission are possible  including fecal-oral  trans-placental  and to a much lesser extent  via a contaminated surface  SARS-CoV-2 cannot transmit via human milk  There is no evidence that infants should be separated from SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers who are well enough to establish or continue breastfeeding,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966113
2615,BACKGROUND  The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of cardiac surgery in patients who were incidentally diagnosed with Covid-19 in the postoperative period  PATIENTS AND METHODS  We performed 826 open cardiac surgeries in five tertiary centers  Most of the surgeries were elective coronary artery bypass grafting  CABG   93 8    A preoperative RT-PCR test and transcutaneous oxygen saturation were routinely investigated prior to surgery  We also investigated whether the patients already received Covid-19 treatment or had any contact with a Covid-19 patient in the last two weeks  We analyzed high sensitive C-reactive protein  hs-CRP   d-dimer  and fibrinogen  which plays a main role in the activation of procoagulant state after surgeries  RESULTS  Acute lung injury related to Covid-19 activation was observed in 48 out of 826 patients  5 8    The median age of 48 patients was 63 9  -12 4 years  Euro-Score and body mass index  BMI  were 6 1  -1 1 and 29 2  -4 1kg m 2   respectively  RT-PCR test results were positive in 29 patients  60 4    We performed thoracic computed tomography  CT  in all patients with or without positive RT-PCR test results  Thoracic CT images showed that there was a different degree of ARDS  mild  moderate  and serious   The median time of extracorporeal circulation  ECC  was 93 2  -14 6 min  in on-pump surgery  IQR  68-155 min    Common symptoms included dyspnea  N   22  45 8   and fever  N   12  25    Eleven patients needed readmission to ICU  Compared with non-admitted to ICU patients  ICU patients were higher comorbidities and severe laboratory abnormalities  eg  high blood d-dimer and fibrinogen   We also detected significantly low oxygen saturation  hypercapnia  and severe acidosis in readmitted patients  Radiologic investigations showed that there were severe ARDS with bilateral pneumonic infiltration resistant to medical treatment in 6 out of 11 patients who died  54 5    CONCLUSION  Diffuse pneumonic infiltration related to Covid-19 may develop in asymptomatic cardiac surgery patients with negative RT-PCR test results  Immunologic disorders resulting from ECC  physiologic distress  and anesthesia may activate Covid-19 during the incubation period  We need randomized clinical trials to explain Covid-19 activation in the latent period of the virus  and clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962467
1465,Despite the dramatic spread of Omicron globally  even among highly vaccinated populations  death rates have not increased concomitantly  These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms  beyond neutralization  may continue to confer protection against severe disease  Beyond their ability to bind and block infection  antibodies contribute to control and clearance of multiple infections via their ability to direct antiviral immunity via Fc-effector mechanisms  Thus  here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies  across three COVID-19 vaccines  to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron  Despite the significant loss of IgM  IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain  RBD  across BNT162b2  mRNA-1273  and CoronaVac vaccines  stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike  Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fcgamma-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine  but preservation of RBD-specific FcgammaR2a and Fcgamma3a binding across the mRNA vaccines  Conversely  Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fcgamma-receptors  across all three vaccines  albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines  marked by a selective preservation of FcgammaR2a and Fcgamma3a binding antibodies  Thus  despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron  vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981072
6639,BACKGROUND  Following an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  on the cruise ship Diamond Princess  passengers and crew were followed-up to determine prognosis  This study examined the epidemiological determinants of COVID-19 natural history using these follow-up data  METHODS  Infection status  diagnosis  clinical symptoms and prognosis were analysed for all passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princess  In addition  the risk of infection associated with exposure within cabin rooms  as well as the risks of various clinical manifestations of disease  along with their epidemiological determinants  were analysed  RESULTS  The adjusted odds ratio  aOR  of infection for individuals tested by polymerase chain reaction on or after 12 February 2020 compared with individuals tested before this date was 0 53  95  confidence interval  CI  0 39-0 72   reflecting decreased transmission during onboard quarantine  Among infected individuals  older age was associated with elevated odds of symptomatic illness  aOR 1 01  95  CI 1 00-1 02   severe disease  aOR 1 08  95  CI 1 05-1 12  and death  aOR 1 12  95  CI 1 05-1 21   CONCLUSIONS  Severe COVID-19 disease  death and symptomatic illness were more frequent among older individuals on the Diamond Princess  Older elderly cases  age >  80 years  had the highest risks of severe disease and death  Inter-room transmission was prevented successfully by the onboard quarantine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902585
503,BACKGROUND  Describing the SARS-CoV-2 viral-load distribution in different patient groups and age categories  METHODS  All results from first nasopharyngeal  NP  and oropharyngeal  OP  swabs from unique patients tested via SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  collected between 1 January and 1 December 2020 predominantly in the Public Health Services regions Kennemerland and Hollands Noorden  province of North Holland  the Netherlands  were included in this study  SARS-CoV-2 PCR crossing-point  Cp -values were used to estimate viral loads  RESULTS  In total  278 455 unique patients were tested  of whom 9 1   n   25 374  were SARS-CoV-2-positive  PCRs performed by Public Health Services  n   211 914   in which sampling and inclusion were uniform  revealed a clear relation between age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load  with especially children aged <12 years showing lower viral loads than adults  beta  -0 03  95  confidence interval  -0 03 to -0 02  p < 0 001   independently of sex and or symptom duration  Interestingly  the median Cp-values between the >79- and <12-year-old populations differed by more than four PCR cycles  suggesting an approximately 16-fold difference in viral load  In addition  the proportion of children aged <12 years with a low load  Cp-value >30  was higher compared with other patients  31 1  vs 17 2   p-value < 0 001   CONCLUSIONS  In patients tested by Public Health Services  SARS-CoV-2 viral load increases with age  Further studies should elucidate whether the lower viral load in children is indeed related to their suggested limited role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission  Moreover  as rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than PCR  these results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests have lower sensitivity in children than in adults,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999848
4295,Arguing for the importance of robust public participation and meaningful Tribal consultation to address the cumulative impacts of federal projects  we bridge interdisciplinary perspectives across law  public health  and Indigenous studies  We focus on openings in existing federal law to involve Tribes and publics more meaningfully in resource management planning  while recognizing the limits of this involvement when only the federal government dictates the terms of participation and analysis  We first discuss challenges and opportunities for addressing cumulative impacts and environmental justice through 2 US federal statutes  the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act  Focusing on a major federal planning process involving fracking in the Greater Chaco region of northwestern New Mexico  we examine how the Department of the Interior attempted Tribal consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic  We also highlight local efforts to monitor Dine health and well-being  For Dine people  human health is inseparable from the health of the land  But in applying the primary legal tools for analyzing the effects of extraction across the Greater Chaco region  federal agencies fragment categories of impact that Dine people view holistically   Am J Public Health  2022 112 1  116-123  https   doi org 10 2105 AJPH 2021 306562,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936404
2008,BACKGROUND  The epipharynx  with its high expression of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  entry factors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  and transmembrane protease  serine 2  TMPRSS2   is a primary target for SARS-CoV-2 replication in the early stage of Coronavirus Disease 19  COVID-19   Epipharyngeal abrasive therapy  EAT  is a treatment for epipharyngitis in Japan which involves applying zinc chloride to the epipharyngeal mucosa  In this study  we evaluated the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in tissue samples from patients before and after EAT  PATIENTS AND METHODS  The study subjects were seven patients that had not been treated with EAT and 11 patients that had  For immunohistochemical assessment of the epipharyngeal mucosa  the staining intensity of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was described as an immunohistochemical score  IHC score   RESULTS  The IHC scores for ACE2 and TEMPRSS2 in the EAT-treated group were 3 40-fold and 1 81-fold lower  respectively  than those in the non-treated group  p 0 0208 and p 0 0244  respectively   CONCLUSION  EAT down-regulates the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2  Thus  EAT has potential as a novel COVID-19 preventative method,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972736
7791,BACKGROUND  Hospitals are vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks  Intrahospital transmission of the disease is a threat to the healthcare systems as it increases morbidity and mortality among patients  It is imperative to deepen our understanding of transmission events in hospital-associated cases of COVID-19 for timely implementation of infection prevention and control measures in the hospital in avoiding future outbreaks  We examined the use of epidemiological case investigation combined with whole genome sequencing of cases to investigate and manage a hospital-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases  METHODS  An epidemiological investigation was conducted in a University Hospital in Malaysia from 23 March to 22 April 2020  Contact tracing  risk assessment  testing  symptom surveillance  and outbreak management were conducted following the diagnosis of a healthcare worker with SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR  These findings were complemented by whole genome sequencing analysis of a subset of positive cases  RESULTS  The index case was symptomatic but did not fulfill the initial epidemiological criteria for routine screening  Contact tracing suggested epidemiological linkages of 38 cases with COVID-19  Phylogenetic analysis excluded four of these cases  This cluster included 34 cases comprising ten healthcare worker-cases  nine patient-cases  and 15 community-cases  The epidemic curve demonstrated initial intrahospital transmission that propagated into the community  The estimated median incubation period was 4 7 days  95  CI  3 5-6 4   and the serial interval was 5 3 days  95  CI  4 3-6 5   CONCLUSION  The study demonstrated the contribution of integrating epidemiological investigation and whole genome sequencing in understanding disease transmission in the hospital setting  Contact tracing  risk assessment  testing  and symptom surveillance remain imperative in resource-limited settings to identify and isolate cases  thereby controlling COVID-19 outbreaks  The use of whole genome sequencing complements field investigation findings in clarifying transmission networks  The safety of a hospital population during this COVID-19 pandemic may be secured with a multidisciplinary approach  good infection control measures  effective preparedness and response plan  and individual-level compliance among the hospital population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886794
547,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  acts as a key receptor for the spike of SARS-CoV-2  Two main microRNAs  miRs   miR-200c-3p and miR-421-5p  are considered to modulate the expression of ACE2 gene and alterations in the expression of these miRNAs may influence the outcomes of COVID-19 infection  Accordingly  we examined whether miRNAs directing ACE2 expression altered in the SARS-CoV-2 infection  30 patients with COVID-19 included in the study  At the time of admission and discharge  the expression of miR-200c-3p and miR-421-5p  inflammatory cytokine IL-6  and regulatory T cells  expression profiles  CD4  CD25  and Foxp3  were examined using quantitative real-time PCR method  At the time of admission  the expression levels of miR-200c-3p and miR-421-5p as well as CD4  CD25  and Foxp3 significantly decreased while IL-6 expression notably enhanced  However  by the time of discharge  the expression levels of the genes were opposite to the time of admission  Moreover  Pearson correlation analysis indicated that IL-6 expression negatively correlated with Foxp3 and miR-200c-3p expressions despite miR-421-5p and miR-200c-3p positively correlated at admission time  By manipulating miR-200c-3p and miR-421-5p expressions and controlling the ACE2 level  it is plausible to modulate the inflammation by reducing IL-6 and maintenance tolerance hemostasis during COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999004
8921,We report on a case of a fulminant non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage after COVID-19 in a patient without previous medical history or known previous illness despite a COVID-19 infection one month prior  We saw rarefied vessels in the area of the left middle cerebral artery besides a massive left frontal hemorrhage on cranial imaging  We concluded that these rarefied vessels are the expression of an RCVS  which fits the history of progressive headaches for one month  The RCVS might be caused by the COVID-19 infection and is related to the hemorrhage  Unfortunately  due to preoperative entrapment  brain death occurred a few days later,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868884

2692,BACKGROUND  Adult-onset Still s disease  AOSD  is an autoinflammatory multi-systemic syndrome  Macrophage activation syndrome  MAS  is a potentially life-threatening complication of AOSD with a mortality rate of 10-20   Especially viral infection is thought to be a common trigger for development of MAS  On the other hand  the occurrence of MAS following vaccinations is extremely rare and has been described in a few cases after measles or influenza vaccinations and more recently after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  COVID-19 viral vector vaccine  Oxford-AZ   CASE PRESENTATION  We report the case of a twenty-year-old female with adult-onset Still s disease  AOSD   who developed a MAS six days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose of BNT162b2  mRNA vaccine  BioNTech Pfizer  with ferritin levels of 136 680 microg l  ref   13-150 microg l   CONCLUSIONS  To the best of our knowledge  this is the first case report of development of MAS in a patient with preexisting AOSD after vaccination in general  and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in particular  The new mRNA vaccines have generally shown a reassuring safety profile  but it has been shown that nucleic acids in general  including mRNA can act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns that activate toll-like receptors with extensive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and further activation of immune cells  Proving an interferon 1 response in our patient directly after vaccination  we think that in this particular case the vaccination might have acted as trigger for the development of MAS  Even if it remains difficult to establish causality in the case of rare adverse events  especially in patients with autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions  these complications are important to monitor and register  but do not at all diminish the overwhelming positive benefit-risk ratio of licensed COVID-19 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961551

8820,Introduction  Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  is a novel viral disease with person-to-person transmission that has spread to many countries since the end of 2019  Although many unknowns were resolved within a year and the vaccine is available  it is still a major global health problem  Objective  COVID-19 infection may present with a considerably wide spectrum of severity and host factors play a significant role in determining the course of the disease  One of these factors is blood groups  Based on previous experience  it is believed that the ABO blood group type affects prognosis  treatment response and length of stay in the hospital  In this study  our aim was to evaluate whether the blood group had an effect on the length of the hospital stay  To the best of our knowledge  no previous studies have assessed the effect of ABO blood groups  as well as age  on the length of the hospital stay in these settings  Methods  In this retrospective cohort study  969 patients admitted to our hospital between March 15  2020 and May 15  2020 were evaluated  The patients were divided into 4 groups according to ABO blood groups  The effect of the ABO blood group by age on the course of the disease  need for intensive care  duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection  especially in geriatric patients  was evaluated  Results  Of all the patients  9 1  required admission to the intensive care unit  ICU   of whom 83  died  The average length of ICU stay was 11 days  0 - 59   The observed mortality rates in blood groups A  B  AB and 0 were 86 4   93 3   80 0  and 70 8   respectively  indicating similar death rates in all ABO blood types  When the Rh phenotype was taken into consideration  no significant changes in results were seen  Conclusion  As a result  we could not observe a significant relationship between blood groups and clinical outcomes in this study  which included a sample of Turkish patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870100
4395,The sudden emergence and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  have greatly accelerated the adoption of novel vaccine strategies  which otherwise would have likely languished for years  In this light  vaccines for certain other pathogens could certainly benefit from reconsideration  One such pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae  pneumococcus   an encapsulated bacterium that can express >100 antigenically distinct serotypes  Current pneumococcal vaccines are based exclusively on capsular polysaccharide-either purified alone or conjugated to protein  Since the introduction of conjugate vaccines  the valence of pneumococcal vaccines has steadily increased  as has the associated complexity and cost of production  There are many pneumococcal proteins invariantly expressed across all serotypes  which have been shown to induce robust immune responses in animal models  These proteins could be readily produced using recombinant DNA technology or by mRNA technology currently used in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  A door may be opening to new opportunities in affordable and broadly protective vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934775

2534,The rapid surge of COVID-19 cases worldwide drew attention to COVID-19 infection as a new source of risk in transport  The virus introduced a need for viral transmission mitigation as a major priority when selecting a mode of travel  and caused a significant drop in public transport use  The recovery of public transport use in the post-COVID period requires that the transport authorities favourably address people s demand for mitigation of the risk of COVID-19 transmission in public transport  The present study aims to explore the role of risk perception  worry and priority of COVID-19 risk reduction along with fatalistic beliefs and public trust in authorities in explaining public demand for risk mitigation  The present study is among the first to investigate the role of fatalistic beliefs  social trust and risk perception for public transport and public demand for risk mitigation  The link between priority of infection prevention and demand for risk mitigation has also been less explored in public transport research  An online survey was conducted among university students in Iran between 19th April and 16th June 2020  during the first wave of the pandemic  when the country was a major epicentre of the disease  A total of 271 out of 370 respondents whose dominant mode on university travels was public transport were included in the analysis  Results of structural equation modelling confirmed the paradox of trust  indicating that social trust is negatively associated with perceived risk of COVID-19 infection  which in turn may lead people to place less importance on COVID-19 prevention as a priority in travel mode choice  and consequently demand less risk mitigation efforts to prevent COVID-19 infection in public transport  Dissimilar to trust  however  the results revealed no relationship between fatalistic beliefs and risk perception  but a significant direct effect of fatalistic beliefs on demand for risk mitigation  To reinforce public demand for mitigating the risk of COVID-19 in public transport  the study calls on policymakers to exploit public trust resources for more effective risk communication  through disseminating the gradually accumulating evidence-based information regarding the infectivity and the virulence of COVID-19 and the scientific risk of infection  The study also underlined the potential importance of considering fatalistic beliefs when developing effective risk communication policies and practices to enhance public support for COVID-19 risk mitigation in public transport,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963755

9629,Front-line healthcare professionals have experienced rapid changes to workload and pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic  resulting in anxiety  depression and mental health stressors  For working professionals engaged in pharmacy postgraduate distance learning  access to educators was seen as a means to relay some of these stories and offload the stress caused by these unprecedented circumstances  The postgraduate pharmacy education team at De Montfort University felt a moral responsibility to provide extra support and extended their roles towards offering greater wellbeing support  In this commentary we detail the emergence of this new role and offer insights into how this was fashioned and its significance for catering to the mental health needs of pharmacists  This role has largely gone undetected and research is needed into the acceptability and feasibility of such a model and its plausibility and sustainability in the long term,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857532
763,BACKGROUND  Despite the fact that the clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is still controversial  it has been demonstrated in vitro to control SARS-CoV-2 multiplication on Vero E6 cells  In this study  we tested the possibility that some patients with prolonged virus excretion could be infected by less susceptible strains  METHOD  Using a high-content screening method  we screened 30 different selected isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from different patients who received azithromycin   - hydroxychloroquine  We focused on patients with viral persistence  i e   positive virus detection in a nasopharyngeal sample >  10 days  and who were tested during two French epidemic waves  late winter-spring of 2020 and the summer of 2020  Dose-response curves in single-molecule assays with hydroxychloroquine were created for isolates with suspected reduced susceptibility  Genome clustering was performed for all isolates  RESULTS  Of 30 tested strains  three were detected as replicating in the presence of azithromycin   hydroxychloroquine  each at 5 muM  The dose-response model showed a decrease in susceptibility of these three strains to hydroxychloroquine  Whole genome sequencing revealed that these three strains are all from the second epidemic wave and two cluster with isolates from Africa  CONCLUSIONS  Reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine was not associated with viral persistence in naso-pharyngeal samples  Rather  it was associated with occurring during the second epidemic wave  which began in the summer and with strains clustering with those with a common genotype in Africa  where hydroxychloroquine was the most widely used,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994164
4372,Background  Glomerular diseases  GD  are chronic conditions that often involve immune dysfunction and require immunosuppressive therapy  IST  to control underlying pathogenesis  Unfortunately  such diseases appear to heighten risks of severe outcomes in COVID-19 and predispose to other infections that may be life-threatening  Thus  averting preventable infections is imperative in GD patients  Summary  The advent of vaccines demonstrated to be safe and efficacious against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has favorably impacted the COVID-19 pandemic epidemiology  However  patients on ISTs were excluded from initial vaccine clinical trials  Thus  only limited and incomplete data are available currently regarding the potential impact of immunosuppression on immune response to or efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  However  new insights are emerging from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies  and impacts of ISTs on conventional vaccines are useful to consider  Mechanisms of immunosuppressive agents commonly used in the treatment of GD are reviewed with respect to implications for immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  ISTs discussed include corticosteroids  alkylating agents  antimetabolites  calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors  CD38   CD20   or CD19  cell depletion  and complement protein C5 inhibition  Key Messages  Many immunosuppressive therapies may potentially attenuate or impair protective immunity of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  However  as vaccines currently in use employ mRNA or nonreplicative viral vectors  they appear to be safe in patients on immunosuppression  further favoring vaccination  Moreover  predominant SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are likely to afford at least partial protective immunity through one or more immune mechanisms even in patients on IST  Guidelines and emerging strategies are also considered to optimize vaccine protection from COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935004
149,Background  SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays offer a rapid mean to diagnose and isolate infected individuals  However  their utility in population-level screening is unknown  Objectives  The performance of two antigen tests in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was assessed among individuals randomly selected in the community  Study Design  A prospective study that performed head-to-head comparison of two SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays  Individuals were recruited during community SARS-CoV-2 screening over 10 working days  Demographic and clinical data were collected  Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test  a point-of-care chromatographic assay  was conducted immediately  and then the sample was transported to the virology laboratory to perform PCR and the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminesence immunoassay  Results  respiratory samples from 991 individuals were collected  and 62 were positive by PCR  Inconclusive PCR results were observed in 19 samples and were excluded  The median age of participants was 40 2 years  IQR 32 3-47 8   and 932  94   were males  Most  77 4   of infections were asymptomatic  The sensitivity and the specificity of the LIAISON assay were 43 3   95 CI 30 6-56 8  and 99 9   95 CI 99 3-100   The Standard Q assay had lower sensitivity  30 6   95 CI 19 6-43 7  but similar specificity  98 8   95 CI  97 8-99 4   Similarly  the LIAISON assay had higher positive predictive value  96 3   95 CI 81-99 9  vs  63 3   95 CI  43 9-80 1    Both assays performed better in symptomatic patients and among samples with a low-cycle threshold  Ct < 25   Conclusion  In our setting of random community surveillance  rapid antigen testing of nasopharyngeal swabs by either LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag  DiaSorin  or Standard Q COVID-19 Ag  SD Biosensor  was less sensitive to detecting SARS-CoV-2 than the TaqPath COVID-19 RT-PCR,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004772
620,Although clinical application of ultrasound to the heart has a history of about 80 years  its big turning point was the emergence of a portable ultrasound diagnostic machine  As a result  the place  where echocardiography is performed widely spread outside the examination room  and the people who perform echocardiography have also greatly increased  Emergency physicians  anesthesiologists  and primary care physicians became interested in echocardiography and started using it  Such ultrasound examinations performed by a doctor for assessment of disease condition  management  or guidance of treatment at bedside has been called point-of-care ultrasound  POCUS   Cardiac POCUS is divided into a focused cardiac ultrasound examination  FoCUS  and limited echocardiography  The former is performed by non-experts in echocardiography  such as emergency physicians and anesthesiologists  whereas the latter is usually performed by cardiologists who are experts in echocardiography  FoCUS has an established protocol and evaluation method  and evidence to prove its effectiveness is accumulating  In addition  the COVID-19 outbreak reaffirmed the importance of POCUS  Although FoCUS is becoming popular in Japan  an educational program has not been established  and discussion on how to educate medical students and residents will be necessary  Even if POCUS in cardiovascular medicine becomes widespread  auscultation will still be necessary  Rather  adding cardiac and vascular POCUS to inspection  palpation  and auscultation in the flow of physical examinations will benefit patients greatly,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997377
8486,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  vaccine development and community vaccination studies are carried out all over the world  At this stage  the opposition to the vaccine seen in the society or the lack of trust in the developed vaccine is an important factor hampering vaccination activities  In this study  aspect-base sentiment analysis was conducted for USA  UK  Canada  Turkey  France  Germany  Spain and Italy showing the approach of twitter users to vaccination and vaccine types during the COVID-19 period  Within the scope of this study  two datasets in English and Turkish were prepared with 928 402 different vaccine-focused tweets collected by country  In the classification of tweets  4 different aspects  policy  health  media and other  and 4 different BERT models  mBERT-base  BioBERT  ClinicalBERT nad BERTurk  were used  6 different COVID-19 vaccines with the highest frequency among the datasets were selected and sentiment analysis was made by using Twitter posts regarding these vaccines  To the best of our knowledge  this paper is the first attempt to understand people s views about vaccination and types of vaccines  With the experiments conducted  the results of the views of the people on vaccination and vaccine types were presented according to the countries  The success of the method proposed in this study in the F1 Score was between 84  and 88  in datasets divided by country  while the total accuracy value was 87,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874877
1720,COVID-19 mortality has disproportionately affected specific occupations and industries  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  OSHA  protects the health and safety of workers by setting and enforcing standards for working conditions  Workers may file OSHA complaints about unsafe conditions  Complaints may indicate poor workplace safety during the pandemic  We evaluated COVID-19-related complaints filed with California  Cal  OSHA between January 1  2020 and December 14  2020 across seven industries  To assess whether workers in occupations with high COVID-19-related mortality were also most likely to file Cal OSHA complaints  we compared industry-specific per-capita COVID-19 confirmed deaths from the California Department of Public Health with COVID-19-related complaints  Although 7820 COVID-19-related complaints were deemed valid by Cal OSHA  only 627 onsite inspections occurred  and 32 citations were issued  Agricultural workers had the highest per-capita COVID-19 death rates  402 per 100 000 workers  but were least represented among workplace complaints  44 per 100 000 workers   Health Care workers had the highest complaint rates  81 per 100 000 workers  but the second lowest COVID-19 death rate  81 per 100 000 workers   Industries with the highest inspection rates also had high COVID-19 mortality  Our findings suggest complaints are not proportional to COVID-19 risk  Instead  higher complaint rates may reflect worker groups with greater empowerment  resources  or capacity to advocate for better protections  This capacity to advocate for safe workplaces may account for relatively low mortality rates in potentially high-risk occupations  Future research should examine factors determining worker complaints and complaint systems to promote participation of those with the greatest need of protection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977326
3833,The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge  demanding researchers address different approaches in relation to prevention  diagnostics and therapeutics  Amongst the many tactics of tackling these therapeutic challenges  small extracellular vesicles  sEVs  or exosomes are emerging as a new frontier in the field of ameliorating viral infections  Exosomes are part of extracellular vesicles  EVs -spherical biological structures with a lipid bilayer of a diameter of up to 5000 nm  which are released into the intercellular space by most types of eukaryotic cells  both in physiological and pathological states  EVs share structural similarities to viruses  such as small size  common mechanisms of biogenesis and mechanisms for cell entry  The role of EVs in promoting the viral spread by evading the immune response of the host  which is exhibited by retroviruses  indicates the potential for further investigation and possible manipulation of these processes when tackling the spread and treatment of COVID-19  The following paper introduces the topic of the use of exosomes in the treatment of viral infections  and presents the future prospects for the use of these EVs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943891
3071,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a recent epidemic disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus type 2  SARS-CoV-2   In pregnancy  SARS-Cov-2 infection creates additional alarm due to concerns regarding the potential for transmission from the mother to the baby during both the antenatal and postpartum times  In general  breastfeeding is seldom disallowed because of infection of the mother  However  there are few exceptions with regards to certain infectious organisms with established transmission evidence from mother to infant and the link of infection of a newborn with significant morbidity and mortality  It is confirmed that pregnant women can become infected with SARS-CoV-2  although the debate on the possible vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is still open  In this regard  the literature is still poor  On the contrary  the information on the safety of breastfeeding even during infections seems reassuring when the mother takes the necessary precautions  However  there are still answered questions regarding the precautions to be taken during breastfeeding by COVID-19 patients  This paper reviews the existing answers to these and many other questions  This review therefore presents a summary of the present-day understanding of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the answers around the maternal transmission of COVID-19 and the potential threat of breastfeeding to babies born to infected pregnant mothers  In conclusion  intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is less likely to occur during pregnancy  Most studies suggest that COVID-19 is not transmitted through breast milk  Correspondingly  COVID-19-infected neonates might acquire the infection via the respiratory route because of the postnatal contact with the mother rather than during the prenatal period  International organizations encourage breastfeeding regardless of the COVID-19 status of the mother or child as long as proper hygienic and safety measures are adhered to so as to minimize the chance of infant infection by droplets and direct contact with the infected mother  Pasteurized donor human milk or infant formula as supplemental feeding can be quite beneficial in the case of mother-infant separation till breastfeeding is safe,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956971

8157,Introduction  CKD5D is a high risk subgroup with high comorbidity burden  need for frequent visits to dialysis centre and a compromised immune system  The effect of SARS COV2 virus on this population is not well known  Methods  This prospective study enrolled  all CKD5D with COVID 19 infection  admitted to our hospital  from 23 rd  April to 30 th  June 2020   whose outcome as discharge mortality was known  Their clinical profile  investigations  treatment and outcome in terms of mortality or discharge after clearing infection was noted and analysed  Results  Total 203 dialysis patients with COVID 19 were referred to our institute  Of these total  131 were analysed  Median age was 50 years  19-80 years  with 57  were males  Hypertension  76   was the commonest comorbidity followed by diabetes  29   and coronary artery disease  22    Dyspnoea  fever and cough were present in 50   40   and 33  patients respectively  26  were asymptomatic  None had dialyser clotting  Mortality was 20 6   Time to turn RT PCR negative was 14 days  3-40 days   Comparing deceased vs survivors  Age  56 vs 49 yrs   diabetes  56  vs 22    duration of symptoms at admission  5 vs 4 days   dyspnea  85  vs 40   and encephalopathy  30  vs 1   at admission  bilateral opacities on Chest X ray  93  vs 20   and high leucocyte count  11 059   - 5 929 vs 7 022   - 2 935 cmm  were statistically significant variables associated with mortality  Conclusion  Asymptomatic group was 26  of the total CKD5D with COVID 19 infection population analysed  Mortality was 20 61   Higher age  later presentation to hospital  diabetes  dyspnoea    encephalopathy at presentation  bilateral opacities on Chest X- Ray   higher leukocyte counts were significantly associated with mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880553
877,BACKGROUND AND AIMS  SARS-CoV-2 and consequent pandemic has presented unique challenges  Beyond the direct COVID-related mortality in those with liver disease  we sought to determine the effect of lockdown on people with liver disease in Scotland  The effect of lockdown on those with alcohol-related disease is of interest  and whether there were associated implications for a change in alcohol intake and consequent presentations with decompensated disease  METHODS  We performed a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to seven Scottish hospitals with a history of liver disease between 1 April and 30 April 2020 and compared across the same time in 2017  2018 and 2019  We also repeated an intermediate assessment based on a single centre to examine for delayed effects between 1 April and 31 July 2020  RESULTS  We found that results and outcomes for patients admitted in 2020 were similar to those in previous years in terms of morbidity  mortality  and length of stay  In the Scotland-wide cohort  admission MELD  Model for End-stage Liver Disease   16  12-22  vs 15  12-19   p 0 141   inpatient mortality   10 9  vs 8 6    p 0 499  and length of stay  8 days  4-15  vs 7 days  4-13   p 0 140   In the Edinburgh cohort  admission MELD  17  12-23  vs 17  13-21   p 0 805   inpatient mortality   13 7  vs 10 1   p 0 373  and length of stay  7 days  4-14  vs 7 days  3 5-14   p 0 525    CONCLUSION  This assessment of immediate and medium-term lockdown impacts on those with chronic liver disease suggested a minimal effect on the presentation of decompensated liver disease to secondary care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992071
7089,This article deals with the question of which unemployment benefit durations are considered fair for which groups  In addition  it examines the extent to which individuals consider longer unemployment insurance benefit durations to be appropriate in times of economic crisis  such as the current situation during the Covid-19 pandemic  Longer reference periods can stabilize the income situation of benefit recipients and can provide time to search for an adequate job and thus increase matching quality  However  they also initially reduce the pressure to look for a job  and they lengthen the period of unemployment in the longer term  Using survey data from two online surveys done in November 2019 and during the crisis in May 2020  we examine which unemployment benefit durations employees consider appropriate  For this purpose  we presented vignettes to the survey participants describing hypothetical unemployed people whose characteristics varied randomly  The results show that the same respondents considered similar reference periods to be appropriate at both dates  In addition  the respondents took into account criteria of contribution as well as neediness when assessing the appropriate duration of benefits for the unemployed  Characteristics such as the age of the unemployed and any existing culpability  life benefits  or contribution periods influenced the duration of the benefit receipt that respondents judged to be appropriate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898722
2061,OBJECTIVES  To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of reimbursed contraceptives in France after 15 months of the pandemic  according to age-group and updating previous data only pertaining to the first lockdown  two months   STUDY DESIGN  We conducted a national register-based study by extracting all reimbursements of oral contraceptives  OC   emergency contraception  EC   intra-uterine devices  IUD  and implants from the French National Health Insurance database  SNDS   which includes and covers 99 5  of the French population  in 2018  2019  2020 and from 01 01 2021 to 04 30 2021  We calculated the expected use of contraceptives in 2020 and 2021 in the absence of the pandemic  based on 2018 and 2019 usage and taking annual trends into account  We assessed the difference between observed and expected dispensing rates by contraceptive type and by age-group  <  18 years old  18<age<  25  25<age<  35  >35   RESULTS  Dispensing of all contraceptives decreased compared to expected dispensing numbers  -2 0  for OC  -5 3  for EC  -9 5  for LNG-IUS  -8 6  for C-IUD  and -16 4  for implant  This decrease in the dispensing of contraceptives was observed in all age-groups  but mainly concerned women under the age of 18 years  -22  for OC  -10  for EC  -37 2  for LNG-IUS  -36 4  for C-IUD  -26 4  for implant  and those aged 18-25  -5 1  for OC  -11 9  for EC  -18 1  for LNG-IUS  -15 9  for C-IUD  -17 6  for implants   CONCLUSIONS  Our study showed that the dispensing of contraceptives in France was markedly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic  Prescriptions for long-acting contraceptive use and women under the age of 25 years were the most substantially impacted  Ensuring access to contraceptive methods during health emergencies must be a public health policy priority,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971603
2487,The Lombardy region has been one of the areas most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic since the first months of 2020  providing real-life experiences in the acute phase  It is unclear how the respiratory rehabilitation network responded to this emergency  The aims of this retrospective study were  i  to analyze clinical  functional  and disability data at admission  ii  describe assessment tools and rehabilitative programs  iii  evaluate improvement after rehabilitation  The study was conducted on data collected from ten pulmonary rehabilitation centers in Lombardy  between the period of March 1st 2020 to March 1st 2021  in patients with respiratory failure recovering from COVID-19 both at admission and discharge  The study included demographics  comorbidities  nutritional status  risk of falls  disability status  Barthel index  Short Physical Performance Battery  SPPB   6 minutes walking test  6MWT   symptoms  dyspnoea with Barthel Dyspnoea and MRC Dyspnoea Scale   length of stay  discharge destination  need for mechanical ventilation  respiratory function  assessment outcomes indices  and prescribed rehabilitative programs  413 patients were analyzed  Length of stay in acute and rehabilitative units was less than 30 days  Fifty   of patients used non-invasive ventilation during their stay  Functional status was mildly compromised for forced volumes and oxygenation  while severely compromised for diffusion capacity  Independency was low while physical performance status very low  At discharge  318  77   patients were sent home  83  20 1   were transferred to an acute unit and 12  2 9   passed away  Barthel Index and 6MWT were the most used  while MRC score was the least used outcome parameter  The 5 main rehabilitative activities were walking  90 8     transfer from bed to armchair  77 5    limb mobilization in bed  76    balance  71 2    and cycle-ergometer or treadmill  43 1    A huge difference was found in admission  discharge  and delta change among different rehabilitative centers  When available  all outcomes showed a significant improvement  With the limitation of a retrospective study with a clear amount of missing data  COVID-19 subjects admitted to rehabilitative centers presented a reduced physical performance  symptoms of dyspnoea  and severe disability  The 6MWT and Barthel index were the most used measurement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964572
5792,Recent molecular biology findings have shown that for the penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus into host cells  a key role is played by protease serine 2  the activity of which is dependent on androgens  The important role of androgens is also evidenced by clinical observations that men in some age categories are infected by this novel coronavirus up to two times more frequently than women  In addition  men with androgenic alopecia tend to have more serious clinical courses  while men with androgen deprivation as a result of prostate cancer treatments tend to have milder courses  This is in line with the fact that preadolescent children are only rarely sickened with serious forms of SARS-CoV-2 infections  Even though these observations may be explained by other factors  many authors have hypothesized that lowered androgen levels and blocking their activity using anti-androgen medication may moderate the course of the viral infection in intermediately- to critically-affected cases  Clearly  it would be important for androgen deprivation to block not just gonadal androgens  but also adrenal androgens  On the other hand  low androgen levels are considered to be a risk factor for the course of SARS-CoV-2 infections  either because low androgen levels have a general effect on anabolic-catabolic equilibrium and energy metabolism  or because of the ability of testosterone to modify the immune system  It is not yet clear if infection with this novel coronavirus might induce hypogonadism  leading to undesirable side effects on male fertility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913348

6973,The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented increase in the U S  price of softwood lumber by more than 300   The reasons for this increase have been attributed to constraints on supply caused by pandemic-induced labor shortages  and increased demand for lumber caused by a Covid-19 related boom in domestic real estate and home improvements  In this paper  we examine the effect that these factors might have had on the increase in prices and the related changes in the welfare of U S  lumber manufacturers and downstream users of lumber  We examine three cases where the demand function shifts outwards   1  the lumber supply function remains unchanged   2  the U S  lumber supply function and that of its trading partners shifts inwards  and  3  U S  lumber producers restrict output at its pre-Covid level  Overall  we find that U S  producers gained between  0 7 and  8 0 billion per quarter as a result of the pandemic  while downstream processors gained  639 million  We argue  however  that the ultimate consumer of the downstream products that require lumber as an input  housing construction  furniture  might well be worse off as surplus lost as a result of reduced expenditures on commodities and services restricted by Covid-19 are not quite recovered when spending switches to lumber-related commodities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899041
1559,BACKGROUND  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic Imperial College School of Medicine developed a structured volunteering programme involving 398 medical students  across eight teaching hospitals  This case study aims to explore the relationship between the processes  context  participant experiences and impacts of the programme so that lessons can be learned for future emergencies and service-learning programmes  METHODS  Using an illuminative approach to evaluation we invited all volunteers and supervisors to complete a mixed-methods survey  This explored differences in experience across demographics and contextual factors  correlations between aspects of induction  supervision and overall experience  and reviewed the impacts of the programme  Quantitative responses were statistically analysed and qualitative reflections were thematically coded to triangulate and explain quantitative findings  Follow up interviews were carried out to check back findings and co-create conclusions  RESULTS  We received responses from 61 students and 17 supervisors  Student participants described predominantly altruistic motivations and transformational changes to their professional identity driven by feeling included  having responsibility  and engaging in authentic workplace-based learning afforded by freedom from the assessed curriculum  They reported new perspectives on their future professional role within the multidisciplinary team and the value of workplace-based learning  They reported increases in wellbeing and self-esteem related to feeling included and valued  and positively contributing to service provision at a time of need  Significantly higher overall satisfaction was associated with a personalised induction  active supervision  earlier stage of training  and male gender  Gender-related differences were not explained through our data but have been reported elsewhere and warrant further study  The duration  intensity and type of role that volunteers performed was similar across demographics and did not appear to modulate their overall experience  CONCLUSIONS  Whilst acknowledging the uniqueness of emergency volunteering and the survey response rate of 15  of volunteers  we suggest the features of a successful service-learning programme include  a learner-centred induction  regular contact with engaged and appreciative supervisors  and roles where students feel valued  Programmes in similar settings may find that service learning is most impactful earlier in medical students  training and that students with altruistic motivations and meaningful work may flourish without formal outcomes and assessments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980091
3111,Background  Solid organ transplantation  SOT  service has been disrupted during the current coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  which deferred the service in most centers worldwide  As the pandemic persists  there will be an urgency to identify the best and safest practices for resuming activities as areas re-open  Resuming activity is a difficult issue  in particular  the decision of reopening after a period of slowing down or complete cessation of activities  Objectives  To share our experience in resuming living donor liver transplantation  LDLT  in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Liver Transplantation Unit of El-Manial Specialized Hospital  Cairo University  Egypt  and to review the obstacles that we have faced  Material and methods  This study is a single-center study  We resumed LDLT by the 26th of August 2020 after a period of closure from the 1st of March 2020  We have taken a lot of steps in order to prevent COVID-19 transmission among transplant patients and healthcare workers  HCWs   Results  In our study  we reported three LDLT recipients  once resuming the transplantation till now  All our recipients and donors tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR a day before the transplantation  Unfortunately  one of them developed COVID-19 infection  We managed rapidly to isolate him in a single room  restricting one team of HCWs to deal with him with strict personal protective measures  Finally  the patient improved and was discharged in a good condition  The second patient ran a smooth course apart from FK neurotoxicity which improved with proper management  The third patient experienced a sharp rise in bilirubin and transaminases on day 14 that was attributed to drug toxicity vs  rejection and managed by discontinuing the offending drugs and pulse steroids  In addition  one of our head nurses tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 that was manageable with self-isolation  Conclusion  Careful patient  donor  personnel screening is mandatory  Adequate supply of personal protective equipments  effective infection control policies  and appropriate administrative modifications are needed for a safe return of LDLT practice,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956680

6914,The emergence of effective vaccines for COVID-19 has been welcomed by the world with great optimism  Given their increased susceptibility to COVID-19  the question arises whether individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus  T2DM  and other metabolic conditions can respond effectively to the mRNA-based vaccine  We aimed to evaluate the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in people with T2DM and or other metabolic risk factors  hypertension and obesity  compared to those without  This study included 262 people  81 diabetic and 181 non-diabetic persons  that took two doses of BNT162b2  Pfizer-BioNTech  mRNA vaccine  Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers  However  both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM  The mean     - 1 standard deviation  levels were 154   - 49 1 vs  138   - 59 4 BAU ml for IgG and 87 1   - 11 6 vs  79 7   - 19 5  for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM  respectively  In a multiple linear regression adjusted for individual characteristics  comorbidities  previous COVID-19 infection  and duration since second vaccine dose  diabetics had 13 86 BAU ml  95  CI  27 08 to 0 64 BAU ml  p 0 041  less IgG antibodies and 4 42   95  CI  8 53 to 0 32   p 0 036  fewer neutralizing antibodies than non-diabetics  Hypertension and obesity did not show significant changes in antibody titers  Taken together  both type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic individuals elicited strong immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine  nonetheless  lower levels were seen in people with diabetes  Continuous monitoring of the antibody levels might be a good indicator to guide personalized needs for further booster shots to maintain adaptive immunity  Nonetheless  it is important that people get their COVID-19 vaccination especially people with diabetes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899701
1278,Background  Kidney transplant recipients are at increased risk of severe disease and death caused by coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  infection  The role of immunosuppressive medications in the clinical presentation  disease course  and outcomes is not well understood  Methods  We analyzed kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 and requiring hospitalization during the initial infection surge at 2 large transplant centers in New Orleans  Louisiana  between February 1  2020 and April 30  2020  Patient presentation  clinical course  kidney transplant function  and postdischarge details are included in this analysis  Results  Twenty-three kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included in the study  The majority of patients were Black  95 7    Diabetes  hypertension  and obesity were present in more than 50  of the patients  The most common presenting symptom was fever  present in 52 2  of patients  All patients were managed with reduction in immunosuppression  Patients received azithromycin  60 9    hydroxychloroquine  47 8    remdesivir  8 7    and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse  8 7    The average length of stay was 4 5 days  range  2-18 days   In this study population  73 9  of the patients sustained acute kidney injury  with an average peak serum creatinine of 3 81 mg dL  Twenty-six percent of the patients required renal replacement therapy  Seventy-seven percent of patients developed proteinuria  at least 1  proteinuria on urinalysis   Of the patients in this population who required mechanical ventilation  39 1    77 8  died  Overall  30 4  of patients died of COVID-19-related complications during admission  Of the 16 patients discharged  the average serum creatinine at discharge was 2 09 mg dL compared with an average preadmission serum creatinine of 1 8 mg dL  Conclusion  During the initial COVID-19 infection surge in New Orleans  we noted that kidney transplant recipients had initial symptoms similar to the general population  However  we recorded a higher incidence of acute kidney injury and death compared to nontransplant patients  Patients who required mechanical ventilation had a high mortality rate  Black patients are overrepresented in our study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984045
2114,Acute necrotizing encephalopathy  ANE  is a rare complication of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  The condition is typically diagnosed based on characteristic neuroimaging findings in the context of active viral respiratory symptoms  We present a rare case of COVID-19-associated ANE presenting with expressive aphasia and encephalopathy in the absence of active respiratory symptoms  Initial evaluation revealed bilateral thalamic lesions and a mild neutrophilic-predominant pleocytosis on cerebrospinal fluid analysis  the latter of which has not been described in previously published cases  Presence of these atypical features prompted extensive diagnostic evaluation  Metagenomic next-generation sequencing on cerebrospinal fluid did not detect the presence of pathogenic nucleic acids  Thalamic biopsy revealed perivascular neutrophilic inflammation suggestive of small vessel vasculitis with surrounding hemorrhage and necrosis  Ultimately  the diagnosis was made following detection of SARS-CoV-2 serologies and after exclusion of alternative etiologies  The patient was successfully treated with a short course of high-dose methylprednisolone with favorable outcome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970720
6324,Identification of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and signaling networks involved in the response of host cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2 is a powerful approach that provides a systems biology view of gene expression programs involved in COVID-19 and may enable the identification of novel therapeutic targets and strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease  In this study  our goal was to identify a transcriptional regulatory network that is associated with gene expression changes between samples infected by SARS-CoV-2 and those that are infected by other respiratory viruses to narrow the results on those enriched or specific to SARS-CoV-2  We combined a series of recently developed computational tools to identify transcriptional regulatory mechanisms involved in the response of epithelial cells to infection by SARS-CoV-2  and particularly regulatory mechanisms that are specific to this virus when compared to other viruses  In addition  using network-guided analyses  we identified kinases associated with this network  The results identified pathways associated with regulation of inflammation  MAPK14  and immunity  BTK  MBX  that may contribute to exacerbate organ damage linked with complications of COVID-19  The regulatory network identified herein reflects a combination of known hits and novel candidate pathways supporting the novel computational pipeline presented herein to quickly narrow down promising avenues of investigation when facing an emerging and novel disease such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907210
181,Infectious disease transmission models often stratify populations by age and geographic patches  Contact patterns between age groups and patches are key parameters in such models  Arenas et al   2020  develop an approach to simulate contact patterns associated with recurrent mobility between patches  such as due to work  school  and other regular travel  Using their approach  mixing between patches is greater than mobility data alone would suggest  because individuals from patches A and B can form contacts if they meet in patch C  We build upon their approach to address three potential gaps that remain  outlined in the bullets below  We describe the steps required to implement our approach in detail  and present step-wise results of an example application to generate contact matrices for SARS-CoV-2 transmission modelling in Ontario  Canada  We also provide methods for deriving the mobility matrix based on GPS mobility data  appendix     Our approach includes a distribution of contacts by age that is responsive to the underlying age distributions of the mixing populations    Our approach maintains different age mixing patterns by contact type  such that changes to the numbers of different types of contacts are appropriately reflected in changes to overall age mixing patterns    Our approach distinguishes between two mixing pools associated with each patch  with possible implications for the overall connectivity of the population  the home pool  in which contacts can only be formed with other individuals residing in the same patch  and the travel pool  in which contacts can be formed with some residents of  and any other visitors to the patch,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004190

5820,Inflammatory activation and or dysfunction of the glomerular endothelium triggers proteinuria in many systemic and localized vascular disorders  Among them are the thrombotic microangiopathies  many forms of glomerulonephritis  and acute inflammatory episodes like sepsis and COVID-19 illness  Another example is the chronic endothelial dysfunction that develops in cardiovascular disease and in metabolic disorders like diabetes  While the glomerular endothelium is a porous sieve that filters prodigious amounts of water and small solutes  it also bars the bulk of albumin and large plasma proteins from passing into the glomerular filtrate  This endothelial barrier function is ascribed predominantly to the endothelial glycocalyx with its endothelial surface layer  that together form a relatively thick  mucinous coat composed of glycosaminoglycans  proteoglycans  glycolipids  sialomucins and other glycoproteins  as well as secreted and circulating proteins  The glycocalyx endothelial surface layer not only covers the glomerular endothelium  it extends into the endothelial fenestrae  Some glycocalyx components span or are attached to the apical endothelial cell plasma membrane and form the formal glycocalyx  Other components  including small proteoglycans and circulating proteins like albumin and orosomucoid  form the endothelial surface layer and are bound to the glycocalyx due to weak intermolecular interactions  Indeed  bound plasma albumin is a major constituent of the endothelial surface layer and contributes to its barrier function  A role for glomerular endothelial cells in the barrier of the glomerular capillary wall to protein filtration has been demonstrated by many elegant studies  However  it can only be fully understood in the context of other components  including the glomerular basement membrane  the podocytes and reabsorption of proteins by tubule epithelial cells  Discovery of the precise mechanisms that lead to glycocalyx endothelial surface layer disruption within glomerular capillaries will hopefully lead to pharmacological interventions that specifically target this important structure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912827

9035,Rationale  SARS-CoV-2 gains entrance to airway epithelial cells  AECs  through binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  on the cell surface  However  ACE2 also converts angiotensin II into angiotensin- 1-7  and counterbalances the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  with resultant protective effects in the cardiovascular system  Some data suggest that two common antihypertension medications  angiotensin II receptor antagonists  ARBs  and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors  ACEIs  may increase ACE2 expression in heart and kidney cells  fueling debate about how these widely used medications may modulate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and risk of COVID-19  Aim  Determine whether exposure of bronchial AECs to the ARB losartan or the ACEI captopril modulate expression of ACE2 by AECs  SARS CoV2 replication  or expression of proinflammatory cytokines and type I and III interferon  IFN  responses  Methods  Primary bronchial AECs from children and adults  n   19  Ages 8-75 yrs  were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures  Cultures were treated with captopril  1 muM  or losartan  2 muM  with culture media changes starting 72 h before infection with SARS-CoV-2  In a biosafety level 3  BSL-3  facility  cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1 2020 at a multiplicity of infection  MOI  of 0 5  At 96 h following infection  RNA and protein were isolated  SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultures was assessed with quantitative PCR  qPCR   ACE2  IL-6  IL-1B  IFNB1  and IFNL2 expression were assessed by qPCR  Results  Neither captopril nor losartan treatment significantly changed ACE2  IL-6  IL-1B  IFNB1  or IFNL2 expression by AECs as compared to SARS-CoV-2 infected AEC cultures without captopril or losartan treatment  At 96 h following infection  SARS-CoV-2 copy number ng RNA was not significantly different between untreated AEC cultures  cultures treated with captopril  or cultures treated with losartan  Conclusion  These findings suggest that at the level of the airway epithelium neither the ACEI captopril or ARB losartan significantly modify expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry factor ACE2  nor does either medication increase replication SARS-CoV-2 replication  This ex vivo data is reassuring and is consistent with evolving clinical data suggesting ACEIs and ARBs do not increase the risk for poor prognosis with COVID-19 and may actually reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867390
5819,Background  Coronavirus disease 2019 can result in myocardial injury in the acute phase  However  information on the late cardiac consequences of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is limited  Methods  We conducted a prospective observational cohort study to investigate the late cardiac consequences of COVID-19  Standard echocardiography and myocardial strain assessment were performed  and cardiac blood biomarkers were tested in 86 COVID-19 survivors 327 days  IQR 318-337 days  after recovery  Comparisons were made with 28 age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls and 30 risk factor-matched patients  Results  There were no significant differences in all echocardiographic structural and functional parameters  including left ventricular  LV  global longitudinal strain  right ventricular  RV  longitudinal strain  LV end-diastolic volume  RV dimension  and the ratio of peak early velocity in mitral inflow to peak early diastolic velocity in the septal mitral annulus  E e   among COVID-19 survivors  healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls  Even 26 patients with myocardial injury at admission did not have any echocardiographic structural and functional abnormalities  There were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to serum concentrations of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide  NT-proBNP  and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I  cTnI   Conclusion  This study showed that COVID-19 survivors  including those with myocardial injury at admission and those with severe and critical types of illness  do not have any echocardiographic evidence of cardiac structural and functional abnormalities 327 days after diagnosis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912863
1554,BACKGROUND  Casirivimab-imdevimab has been developed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2  The global clinical trials in outpatients documented several adverse effects  AE   which mandate caution in Japan where part of patients return home  To investigate post-infusion clinical events and their risk factors  we attempted a retrospective study  MAIN BODY  Subjects were a consecutive series of inpatients with COVID-19 undergoing an infusion of casirivimab-imdevimab in our institute  The criteria for administration were in accordance with previous clinical trials  e g   exclusion of patients necessitating oxygen supply  In Japan  however  SARS-CoV-2 vaccinees were eligible  Methods were review of background factors of status  imaging  and laboratory findings for the outcome of post-infusion events such as temperature increase  Temp    pulse oximetry below 94   and other events  Also  we documented the drug efficacy  Of a total of 96 patients with a median follow-up of 54 days  one  1 0   died who alone was an exception demanding oxygen supply  Other 95 patients  99 0   recovered from fever and hypoxia by Day 4 and later had no worsening of COVID-19  Median increase of body temperature was 1 0 degrees Celsius  which was used for computation of Temp   Multivariate analysis showed that for Temp   n   47   white blood cell counts more than 4 3 x 10 3  microliter  Odds Ratio  OR  2 593  95  Confidence Interval  CI  1 060-6 338  P   0 037  was at risk  whereas 2-time vaccination for SARS-CoV-2  OR 0 128  95  CI 0 026-0 636  P   0 012  was a preventing factor  Likewise for lowered oximetry  n   21   CT showing bilateral ground glass attenuation  OR 5 544  CI 1 599-19 228  P   0 007  was a significant risk factor  Two patients  2 1   showed bradycardia  asymptomatic  intervention not indicated  on Day 3 and recovery on Day 5  Limitations for this study included the difficulty distinguishing AE from worsening of COVID-19  thus we documented as clinical events  CONCLUSIONS  For 24 h after infusion of casirivimab-imdevimab  COVID-19 patients with increased white blood cell counts may be predisposed to temperature elevation more than 1 0 degrees centigrade  as may bilateral ground glass opacity to lowered oximetry  Thus  patients with leukocytosis and bilateral ground glass attenuation may need precaution for transient fever and hypoxia  respectively,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980269

8630,BACKGROUND  Data in the literature about HSV reactivation in COVID-19 patients are scarce  and the association between HSV-1 reactivation and mortality remains to be determined  Our objectives were to evaluate the impact of Herpes simplex virus  HSV  reactivation in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infections primarily on mortality  and secondarily on hospital-acquired pneumonia ventilator-associated pneumonia  HAP VAP  and intensive care unit-bloodstream infection  ICU-BSI   METHODS  We conducted an observational study using prospectively collected data and HSV-1 blood and respiratory samples from all critically ill COVID-19 patients in a large reference center who underwent HSV tests  Using multivariable Cox and cause-specific  cs  models  we investigated the association between HSV reactivation and mortality or healthcare-associated infections  RESULTS  Of the 153 COVID-19 patients admitted for >   48 h from Feb-2020 to Feb-2021  40 153  26 1   patients had confirmed HSV-1 reactivation  19 61  31 1   with HSV-positive respiratory samples  and 36 146  24 7   with HSV-positive blood samples  Day-60 mortality was higher in patients with HSV-1 reactivation  57 5   versus without  33 6   p   0 001   After adjustment for mortality risk factors  HSV-1 reactivation was associated with an increased mortality risk  hazard risk  HR  2 05  95  CI 1 16-3 62  p   0 01   HAP VAP occurred in 67 153  43 8   and ICU-BSI in 42 153  27 5   patients  In patients with HSV-1 reactivation  multivariable cause-specific models showed an increased risk of HAP VAP  csHR 2 38  95  CI 1 06-5 39  p   0 037   but not of ICU-BSI  CONCLUSIONS  HSV-1 reactivation in critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with an increased risk of day-60 mortality and HAP VAP,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872611
5785,Increasing evidence points to host genetics as a factor in COVID-19 prevalence and outcome  CCR5 is a receptor for proinflammatory chemokines that are involved in host responses  especially to viruses  The CCR5-delta32 minor allele is an interesting variant  given the role of CCR5 in some viral infections  particularly HIV-1  Recent studies of the impact of CCR5-delta32 on COVID-19 risk and severity have yielded contradictory results  This ecologic study shows that the CCR5-delta32 allelic frequency in a European population was significantly negatively correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases  p 0 035  and deaths  p 0 006  during the second pandemic wave  These results suggest that CCR5-delta32 may be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection  as it is against HIV infection  and could be predictive of COVID-19 risk and severity  Further studies based on samples from populations of different genetic backgrounds are needed to validate these statistically obtained findings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913355
4554,The significant reduction in PM2 5 mass concentration after the outbreak of COVID-19 provided a unique opportunity further to study the formation mechanism of secondary inorganic aerosols  Hourly data of chemical components in PM2 5  gaseous pollutants  and meteorological data were obtained from January 1 to 23  2020  pre-lockdown  and January 24 to February 17  2020  COVID-lockdown  in Zhengzhou  China  Sulfate  nitrate  and ammonium were the main components of PM2 5 during both the pre-lockdown and COVID-lockdown periods  Compared with the pre-lockdown period  even though the concentration and proportion of nitrate decreased  nitrate was the dominant component in PM2 5 during the COVID-lockdown period  Moreover  nitrate production was enhanced by the elevated O3 concentration  which was favorable for the homogeneous and hydrolysis nitrate formation despite the drastic decrease of NO2  The proportion of sulfate during the COVID-lockdown period was higher than that before  Aqueous-phase reactions of H2O2 and transition metal  TMI  catalyzed oxidations were the major pathways for sulfate formation  During the COVID-lockdown period  TMI-catalyzed oxidation became the dominant pathway for aqueous-phase sulfate formation because the elevated acidity favored the dissolution of TMI  Therefore  the enhanced TMI-catalyzed oxidation affected by the elevated particle acidity dominated the sulfate formation  resulting in the slight increase of sulfate concentration during the COVID-lockdown period in Zhengzhou,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933059

3090,Despite evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy  CBT  for obsessive-compulsive disorder  OCD   many individuals with OCD lack access to needed behavioral health treatment  Although some literature suggests that virtual modes of treatment for OCD are effective  it remains unclear whether intensive programs like partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs  PHP and IOPs  can be delivered effectively over telehealth  TH  and within the context of a global pandemic  Limited extant research suggests that clinicians perceive attenuated treatment response during the pandemic  The trajectory and outcomes of two matched samples were compared using linear mixed modeling  a pre-COVID in-person  IP  sample  n   239  and COVID TH sample  n   239   Findings suggested that both modalities are effective at treating OCD and depressive symptoms  although the pandemic TH group required an additional 2 6 treatment days  The current study provides evidence that PHP and IOP treatment delivered via TH during the COVID-19 pandemic is approximately as effective as pre-pandemic IP treatment and provides promising findings for the future that individuals with complicated OCD who do not have access to IP treatment can still experience significant improvement in symptoms through TH PHP and IOP treatment during and potentially after the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956827
1721,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated policy responses  such as physical distancing interventions  pose risks to mental health that could be mitigated by social support systems  We examine associations between changes in mental health in the population aged 50 years and older in Europe and stringency of pandemic responses and social protection  Methods  We analysed data from the Survey of Health  Ageing and Retirement in Europe  n 50 278 individuals aged 50 years and older in 26 European countries between June and August 2020  Linear multivariable regression models were used to evaluate potential risk factors for deterioration in self-reported mental health and investigate whether social protection systems mitigate it  Results  Across the European Union  28 1   95  CI 27 1-29 2  of participants reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic  ranging from 16 1  in Slovakia to 54 8  in Portugal  Factors associated with increased risk of deterioration included  being female  12 7 percentage points  ppt   95 CI 9 2-16 2   experiencing unmet healthcare needs during the pandemic  14 6ppt  95 CI 11 2-18 1   job loss during the pandemic  6 2ppt  95 CI 1 1-11 8   and financial hardship  5 1ppt  95 CI 2 9-7 2   Greater stringency of physical distancing measures in countries was associated with worsening mental health  0 2ppt per each one point increase on a stringency index  95  CI 0 09-0 4   however  country-level pre-pandemic expenditures on various social protection packages was associated with decreased probability of worsening mental health  -1 3ppt  95 CI  0 3 to -2 3 per euro1 000 increase in health care expenditures per capita and  among the unemployed  -3 8ppt  95 CI  1 6 to -2 4 per euro100 increase in unemployment expenditure per capita   Conclusions  The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with substantial mental health deterioration exhibiting social inequalities  Adverse mental health has been exacerbated by policy responses to the pandemic regulating physical distancing  but social protection expenditure might have helped mitigate the impact  Strengthening social protection systems might render the mental health of the population more resilient to the consequences of crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977323

3880,BACKGROUND  Pediatric COVID-19 is a current health burden mostly due to the lack of knowledge in terms of symptoms  clinical course and management  COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is one of the most recently described complications among adults  along with acquired thrombophilia resulting in an increased risk for venous  arterial and microvascular thrombosis  CASE PRESENTATION  We report the case of a 4-year-old male child  admitted to our clinic for generalized seizures being intubated and mechanically ventilated before admission  with a personal history of ureterovesical junction obstruction  mild hydronephrosis  and an episode of generalized seizures  The laboratory tests revealed anemia  an increased number of monocytes  and a mildly increased C-reactive protein  A real-time polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  of the oropharyngeal swab was performed and it tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the child and both of his parents  The thoracic CT showed consolidation in the lower lobe of the left lung associated with an opacity in the right apex  suggesting possible atelectasis  We initiated antibiotic  antiviral  corticosteroids  as well as anticoagulants and antipyretics  continuing the chronic anticonvulsant therapy  The patient s condition deteriorated progressively  and  after 72 h of hospitalization  he developed desaturation and bradycardia  The laboratory parameters on the third day showed leucopenia  neutropenia  increased creatine kinase  a high ferritin level  hypoalbuminemia  a prolonged prothrombin time and an increased international normalized ration  The patient died on the fourth day of admission  CONCLUSION  In spite of its low incidence and frequent benign clinical course  COVID-19 complications such as coagulopathy might represent a leading cause of death  even in pediatric patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943324
9504,As the coronavirus 2019 disease  COVID-19  pandemic is going through its second year  the world is counting more than 4 9 million lives lost  Many repurposed immunomodulatory drugs have been tried and failed to treat COVID-19  The only successful treatments that improve survival are systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab  by targeting the systemic inflammatory cascade  An intriguing observation that patients with chronic respiratory disease seem to be less prone to COVID-19 gave ground to the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids  ICS  may protect them from SARS-CoV-2 infection  In this review  we summarize current evidence regarding the therapeutic role of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19  and we present experimental data on the potential actions of ICS against SARS-CoV-2 infection  We also discuss safety issues as well as therapeutic considerations and clinical implications of the use of ICS in COVID-19  Four randomized controlled trials  RCT  with more than 3 000 participants suggest that ICS may lead to earlier clinical improvement and lower rate of hospitalization in patients with mild COVID-19  while 9 ongoing RCTs are anticipated to provide more evidence for the use of ICS in COVID-19  Recent evidence has shown promise that ICS could provide tangible benefits to patients suffering from COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859641

2455,Class II tetramer reagents for eleven common DR alleles and a DP allele prevalent in the world population were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 CD4  T cell epitopes  A total of 112  28 and 42 epitopes specific for Spike  Membrane and Nucleocapsid  respectively  with defined HLA-restriction were identified  Direct ex vivo staining of PBMC with tetramer reagents was used to define immunodominant and subdominant T cell epitopes and estimate the frequencies of these T cells in SARS-CoV-2 exposed and naive individuals  Majority of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes identified have <67  amino acid sequence identity with endemic coronaviruses and are unlikely to elicit high avidity cross-reactive T cell responses  Four SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive epitopes  including a DPB1 04 01 restricted epitope  with >  67  amino acid sequence identity to endemic coronavirus were identified  SARS-CoV-2 T cell lines for three of these epitopes elicited cross-reactive T cell responses to endemic cold viruses  An endemic coronavirus Spike T cell line showed cross-reactivity to the fourth SARS-CoV-2 epitope  Three of the Spike cross-reactive epitopes were subdominant epitopes  while the DPB1 04 01 restricted epitope was a dominant epitope  Frequency analyses showed Spike cross-reactive T cells as detected by tetramers were present at relatively low frequency in unexposed people and only contributed a small proportion of the overall Spike-specific CD4  T cells in COVID-19 convalescent individuals  In total  these results suggested a very limited number of SARS-CoV-2 T cells as detected by tetramers are capable of recognizing ccCoV with relative high avidity and vice versa  The potentially supportive role of these high avidity cross-reactive T cells in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 needs further studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965282
8342,Introduction  Corticosteroids are one of the most promising therapeutic agents for critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Despite emerging data  assessed populations and regimens vary  and there are patient subgroups whose response to steroids remains unclear  We aimed to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit  ICU  and treated with a short dexamethasone course to determine which patient categories derive the highest benefit  Methods  A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a prospectively collected single-center ICU database  April 1-October 1  2020   Adult COVID-19 patients were assigned to dexamethasone  12 mg x 3 days  and usual care groups  Patient  management  and outcome data were extracted  The primary outcome was the 28-day ICU mortality  Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the impact of dexamethasone on mortality in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   Results  Of 233 patients  220  median age  65 years  38  female  were included  83 patients received dexamethasone and 137 received usual care  Overall  28  33 7   and 54  39 4   patients in the dexamethasone and usual care groups  respectively  died within 28 days since ICU admission  rate ratio  RR  0 86  95  confidence interval  95  CI   0 59-1 23  p 0 405   In the IMV cohort  dexamethasone did not decrease the 28-day mortality compared with usual care  47 5  vs  62 0   RR 0 78  95  CI  0 57-1 09  p 0 107   A subgroup analysis revealed significantly lower 28-day mortality in IMV patients <65 years receiving dexamethasone vs  usual care  22 6  vs  48 5   RR 0 47  95  CI  0 22-0 98  p 0 043   which was not seen in IMV patients >  65 years  75 0  vs  71 1   RR 1 06  95  CI  0 79-1 42  p 0 719   Patients >  65 years experienced hyperglycemia  bacterial infection  and septic shock significantly more often than younger patients who received dexamethasone  p 0 002  p 0 025  and p < 0 001  respectively   Conclusions  A 3-day dexamethasone course is not associated with lower 28-day mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients  either in the entire ICU cohort or in the IMV  Dexamethasone may significantly reduce the 28-day mortality in IMV patients <65 years  but not in the older IMV subgroup  Dexamethasone administration in patients >  65 years is associated with a significantly higher rate of adverse events than that in younger patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877019
2270,The COVID-19 pandemic has brought age bias and the unmet mental health needs of older adults into bold relief  Even before the pandemic  the psychological needs of older adults often went unaddressed  or were poorly addressed by a system that lacks an adequate number of providers and insufficiently integrates geropsychological services across care settings  In the decade ahead  the number of older adults in the United States will continue to grow  with the potential for expanded demand and contracted service options  Life changes that typically occur with aging will interact with societal upheavals  pandemic  civil unrest  economic inequality  to exacerbate the mental health needs in the current cohort of older adults and the  near old   At the same time  ageism  inequitable access  and financial and policy constraints may limit health care access  Following a review of current demographic and epidemiological data  we describe several trends that will affect the prevalence of mental health issues among older adults and how mental health care is delivered  and we discuss their implications for education  research  and practice  For both personal and professional reasons  all psychologists can benefit from understanding these trends in aging   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968089
2075,BACKGROUND  Primary care providers are on the front lines of dementia care and frequently the first point of contact for individuals and families concerned about changes in memory and thinking  In addition to the challenges of managing complex medical comorbidities  primary care providers in rural or lower-resource settings often lack access to specialists  interdisciplinary teams or other programs and services to aid in diagnosis and care of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and dementia  The current project extends an existing technology-based hub and spoke model virtual clinic  Project ECHO  Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes  University of New Mexico   to improve diagnosis and care of dementia in primary care  METHOD  The current project is an extension of work related to the Washington State Plan for Alzheimer s Disease and Other Dementias with implementation supported by legislative funding  The program includes an interdisciplinary expert panel   hub   meeting with participants   spokes   including primary and allied health care providers from healthcare systems  group practices  and solo practitioners  The twice-monthly virtual clinic sessions include a brief didactic followed by case-based learning in an  all-teach  all-learn  format emphasizing expertise and experience of spoke sites as well as the hub  Participants are provided with resources discussed during the clinic session  ongoing opportunities for consultation  and free continuing education credits  RESULTS  Launching amid the COVID-19 pandemic  the program has provided over 250 hours of education to more than 50 providers across 20 unique sites  Post session surveys indicate that the program is well-received with 2 in 3 providers indicating that they will change their practice based on learning  Surveys also demonstrate significant increases in both knowledge and confidence in dementia-specific diagnosis and care  CONCLUSION  The success of the current project demonstrates both the feasibility and benefit of leveraging technology to deliver dementia-related education to primary care providers in rural and under-resourced settings  While initially hampered by disruptions in care due to the COVID-19 pandemic  increased technological proficiency on the provider and systems level has appeared to be a benefit in terms of resources and comfort participating in a virtual education program to scale Dementia Capable Care in Primary Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971269
6595,To fight against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   the vaccination is currently the most effective approach  However  in addition to common systemic side effects  the vaccines can cause serious allergic reactions or anaphylaxis  In anaphylaxis  the exposure to the allergen causes a sudden release of chemical mediators from mast cells  for which adrenaline is the drug of first choice  In our previous basic studies  in addition to adrenaline  anti-allergic drugs  olopatadine  loratadine  tranilast and ketotifen   antibiotics  clarithromycin   corticosteroids  hydrocortisone and dexamethasone  and certain food constituents  caffeine and catechin  inhibited the process of exocytosis and showed their effectiveness as highly potent mast cell stabilizers  In these studies  since mast cells were pre-incubated with these drugs or the food constituents before exocytosis was induced  the findings strongly indicated their prophylactic efficacy in stabilizing mast cells  Considering such pharmacological properties of these commonly prescribed medications or the food constituents  their prophylactic use may potentially be beneficial in preventing anaphylaxis caused by COVID-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903238
6906,COVID-19 has caused significant morbidity and mortality around the world  Recent reports point toward the  cytokine storm  as core of pathogenesis in SAR-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury  acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   coagulopathy  and multiorgan failure  We have presented clinical data here wherein cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients do not match typical cytokine storm seen in ARDS  Interestingly  COVID-19 patients in early disease present with hypoxemia with no significant respiratory dysfunction  In addition  it is reported that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have a high incidence of thrombotic complications  especially involving the pulmonary vasculature  We hypothesized that core to pathogenesis of COVID-19 is the dysregulation of neutrophils  which culminates in excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps  NETs   Recently  an increasing amount of NETs have been seen in sera of severe COVID-19 patients  We have discussed here mechanisms involved which lead to thrombogenesis and vasculitis because of excessive release of NETs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899934
6727,Background and Aim  The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a national emergency in the United States in March 2020  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently released recommendations that health-care facilities temporarily delay elective surgeries and non-essential medical procedures  Disruptions to medical care significantly impacted cancer patients  with cancer screenings halted and nonurgent cancer surgeries postponed as health-care facilities shifted resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic  Although it has been reported that cancer screening rates decreased dramatically in the United States in 2020  it is unclear whether this trend was driven by factors related to public interest in cancer and or cancer screening as opposed to other factors such as clinical backlogs  pandemic-related policies  and or resource limitations  The purpose of this study was to use the Google Trends tool to evaluate public interest in six common malignancies and four common cancer screening methods during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  We used the Google Trends tool to quantify public interest in six different malignancies  Breast Cancer  Colon Cancer  Lung Cancer  Prostate Cancer  Thyroid Cancer  and Cervical Cancer  and four cancer screening methods  Pap Smear  Lung Cancer Screening  Mammogram  and Colonoscopy  in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic  Welch s t-tests were used to compare monthly search volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic  2020  to the 4 years before the pandemic  2016 - 2019  for all ten search terms included in our study  We used Benjamini-Hochberg to adjust raw p values to account for multiple statistical comparisons  The level of statistical significance was defined by choosing a false discovery rate of 0 05  Results  Our results indicate significantly reduced interest in all malignancies studied at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  Public interest in   Breast Cancer      Colon Cancer      Lung Cancer      Thyroid Cancer    and   Cervical Cancer   significantly decreased in the months of March  April  May  and June 2020 when compared with public interest in 2016-2019  Public interest in cancer screening methods such as   Pap Smear      Lung Cancer Screening      Mammogram    and   Colonoscopy   significantly deceased in the months of April and May compared to 2016 - 2019 values  However  decreased public interest in cancer screening methods was temporary  with Google search volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in June 2020 - December 2020  Conclusion  There was significantly reduced public interest in both common malignancies and cancer screening methods at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States  However  after an initial decline  public interest as indicated by Google search volumes quickly returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of the calendar year 2020  In addition  trends in public interest in cancer screening as indicated by Google search volumes aligned with cancer screening uptake rates in the United States during the study period  This finding suggests that Google Trends may serve as an effective tool in gauging the public s interest in cancer and or cancer screenings in the United States  which makes it a valuable resource that can be used to inform decisions aimed at improving cancer screening rates in the future  Relevance for Patients  The Google Trends tool can be used to measure public interest in various malignancies and their associated screening methods  Google Trends data may be used to inform measures aimed at improving cancer screening uptake,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901518
4467,Driven by an unexpected transition into virtual working worldwide as a result of the Coronavirus disease 2019  Covid-19  pandemic  in this paper  we examine the extent to which existing knowledge from the literature on virtual teams  VTs  spanning two decades can be used to inform how leadership can be exercised in the Covid-19  new normal   involving  reconfigured  VTs which have both similarities with  and differences from  earlier VTs  Drawing on existing literature on VTs pre-Covid-19  we explore what current  and future  VTs might look like and what this means for leadership in this new context with an emphasis on how leadership  or e-leadership  can be exercised to help the leaders of traditional  physically collocated teams that had to transition into VTs  These new e-leaders need to come to grips with a variety of new challenges in order to create high-performing and sustainable VTs  Following a semi-systematic  state-of-the-art literature review  we   a  identify key themes and explain with a theoretical model how existing knowledge can lead to new insights for newly transitioned e-leaders   b  discuss what future information systems  IS  researchers should focus on given the reconfiguration and new characteristics of VTs in the Covid-19 context  and  c   translate  the findings of our synthesis of the existing literature into prescriptive advice that can be used to inform practitioners,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934257

7759,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the healthcare system  Ramp down of surgical services led to significant backlogs for time-sensitive scheduled pediatric patients  We designed and implemented a novel pilot weekend surgical quality improvement project called Operating Room Ramp-Up After COVID Lockdown Ends - Extra Lists  ORRACLE-Xtra   OBJECTIVE  Our overall goals were to increase patient access to surgery  and reduce the waitlist   improve operating room efficiencies  and optimize parent and staff experience  METHODS  Using the DMAIC framework  define  measure  analyze  improve  control   we implemented ORRACLE-Xtra in a tertiary care academic pediatric hospital during a quiescence of the COVID-19 pandemic and defined process and outcome measures based on provincial targets of out of window cases  Parental and staff satisfaction was tracked by surveys  Results  ORRACLE-Xtra led to 247 patients receiving surgery during the pilot period resulting in a 5 percent decrease in the total number of patients on our waitlist with P-CATS IV 59 5   with 38 1  out-of-window of provincial targets  Most of the process and outcome measures were met or exceeded  Overall parental satisfaction was at 95 8  with staff reporting 79 1  satisfaction of working on the weekends  RESULTS  ORRACLE-Xtra led to 247 patients receiving surgery during the pilot period resulting in a 5 percent decrease in the total number of patients on our waitlist with P-CATS IV 59 5   with 38 1  out-of-window of provincial targets  Most of the process and outcome measures were met or exceeded  Overall parental satisfaction was at 95 8  with staff reporting 79 1  satisfaction of working on the weekends  CONCLUSIONS  Through the ORRACLE-Xtra pilot program  we have shown that hospitals impacted by COVID-19 can reduce the surgical backlog using innovative models of service delivery in a Canadian context  Sustained funding is critical to achieving more meaningful reductions in wait times for scheduled surgeries over the longer term and needs to be balanced with staff well-being  CLINICALTRIAL  N A,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887242
1765,The appearance and magnitude of the immune response and the related factors correlated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination need to be defined  Here  we enrolled a prospective cohort of 52 participants who received two doses of inactivated vaccines  BBIBP-CorV   Their serial plasma samples  n   260  over 2 months were collected at five timepoints  We measured antibody responses  NAb  S-IgG and S-IgM  and routine blood parameter  NAb seroconversion occurred in 90 7  of vaccinated individuals and four typical NAb kinetic curves were observed  All of the participants who seroconverted after the first dose were females and had relatively high prevaccine estradiol levels  Moreover  those without seroconversion tended to have lower lymphocyte counts and higher serum SAA levels than those who experienced seroconversion  The NAb titers in young vaccine recipients had a significantly higher peak than those in elderly recipients  S-IgG and S-IgM dynamics were accompanied by similar trends in NAb  Here  we gained insight into the dynamic changes in NAbs and preliminarily explored the prevaccine blood parameters related to the kinetic subclasses  providing a reference for vaccination strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976867
7046,The COVID-19 crisis brought numerous challenges to work life  One of the most notable may be the acceleration of digital transformation  accompanied by an intensification of e-mail usage and related demands such as high e-mail workload  While research quickly started to examine the implications of these changes for employees  another important group of stakeholders has been overlooked  leaders  We focus on leaders during the COVID-19 crisis and examine how COVID-19-related work intensification links to leaders  e-mail overload appraisal and finally exhaustion and transformational leadership  a leader behaviour especially needed in times of crisis  In a 5-day diary study in September 2020  84 leaders responded to daily surveys on 343 days  Results of multilevel analysis showed that perceived COVID-19-related work intensification was positively linked to worktime spent dealing with e-mail and appraised e-mail overload  E-mail overload appraisal was positively related to leaders  exhaustion  but unrelated to their transformational behaviour  Day-specific time spent dealing with e-mail  however  was negatively related to transformational leadership  E-mail overload appraisal mediated the relationship between COVID-19-related work intensification and exhaustion  Turning the focus on leaders during the COVID-19 crisis  our study has important implications for the design of work of leaders in times of crisis and beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898805
1919,BACKGROUND  Mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have been launched globally  but the translation from vaccination intention to actual vaccine uptake by the public remains unknown  hindering the evaluation of present promotion strategies  METHODS  Six months after the national vaccination campaign in China  a longitudinal study was conducted among the Chinese adult population  whose vaccination intention has been previously surveyed  to examine the vaccine uptake  the relationship between intention and actual vaccination  and factors associated with actual vaccination behaviors with multiplelogistic models  RESULTS  Among the total 1047 participants  81 8   834 936  of those who had a prior COVID-19 vaccination intention before the campaign actually received the vaccine  while 61 3   68 111  of those without a prior intention got vaccinated  Having a prior vaccination intention  believing in vaccine safety and receiving frequent recommendations from community sources were significant predictors of vaccine uptake  while the shortage of vaccine supply would reduce the likelihood of getting vaccinated  CONCLUSIONS  Promotion interventions for vaccination intentions need to be launched well before the availability of the vaccine  Sustaining vaccination attitudes and intentions  reducing barriers  e g  vaccine safety concerns  accessibility  affordability  and shaping vaccination behavior would be effective in closing the intention-action gap and motivating vaccine uptake,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974779
1983,High-quality randomised clinical trials testing moderately fractionated breast radiotherapy have clearly shown that local control and survival is at least as effective as with 2 Gy daily fractions with similar or reduced normal tissue toxicity  Fewer treatment visits are welcomed by patients and their families  and reduced fractions produce substantial savings for health-care systems  Implementation of hypofractionation  however  has moved at a slow pace  The oncology community have now reached an inflection point created by new evidence from the FAST-Forward five-fraction randomised trial and catalysed by the need for the global radiation oncology community to unite during the COVID-19 pandemic and rapidly rethink hypofractionation implementation  The aim of this paper is to support equity of access for all patients to receive evidence-based breast external beam radiotherapy and to facilitate the translation of new evidence into routine daily practice  The results from this European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology Advisory Committee in Radiation Oncology Practice consensus state that moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy can be offered to any patient for whole breast  chest wall  with or without reconstruction   and nodal volumes  Ultrafractionation  five fractions  can also be offered for non-nodal breast or chest wall  without reconstruction  radiotherapy either as standard of care or within a randomised trial or prospective cohort  The consensus is timely  not only is it a pragmatic framework for radiation oncologists  but it provides a measured proposal for the path forward to influence policy makers and empower patients to ensure equity of access to evidence-based radiotherapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973228
1314,BACKGROUND  Gold nanoparticles  AuNPs  have been widely used in local surface plasmon resonance  LSPR  immunoassays for biomolecule sensing  which is primarily based on two conventional methods  absorption spectra analysis and colorimetry  The low figure of merit  FoM  of the LSPR and high-concentration AuNP requirement restrict their limit of detection  LOD   which is approximately ng to mug mL -1  in antibody detection if there is no other signal or analyte amplification  Improvements in sensitivity have been slow in recent for a long time  and pushing the boundary of the current LOD is a great challenge of current LSPR immunoassays in biosensing  RESULTS  In this work  we developed spectral image contrast-based flow digital nanoplasmon-metry  Flow DiNM  to push the LOD boundary  Comparing the scattering image brightness of AuNPs in two neighboring wavelength bands near the LSPR peak  the peak shift signal is strongly amplified and quickly detected  Introducing digital analysis  the Flow DiNM provides an ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio and has a lower sample volume requirement  Compared to the conventional analog LSPR immunoassay  Flow DiNM for anti-BSA detection in pure samples has an LOD as low as 1 pg mL -1  within only a 15-min detection time and 500 muL sample volume  Antibody assays against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in artificial saliva that contained various proteins were also conducted to validate the detection of Flow DiNM in complicated samples  Flow DiNM shows significant discrimination in detection with an LOD of 10 pg mL -1  and a broad dynamic detection range of five orders of magnitude  CONCLUSION  Together with the quick readout time and simple operation  this work clearly demonstrated the high sensitivity and selectivity of the developed Flow DiNM in rapid antibody detection  Spectral image contrast and digital analysis further provide a new generation of LSPR immunoassay with AuNPs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983543

4224,BACKGROUND  Since the appearance of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  a growing body of evidence has suggested that weather factors  particularly temperature and humidity  influence transmission  This relationship might differ for the recently emerged B 1 617 2  delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2  Here we use data from an outbreak in Sydney  Australia that commenced in winter and time-series analysis to investigate the association between reported cases and temperature and relative humidity  METHODS  Between 16 June and 10 September 2021  the peak of the outbreak  there were 31 662 locally-acquired cases reported in five local health districts of Sydney  Australia  The associations between daily 9 00 am and 3 00 pm temperature   degrees C   relative humidity     and their difference  and a time series of reported daily cases were assessed using univariable and multivariable generalized additive models and a 14-day exponential moving average  Akaike information criterion  AIC  and the likelihood ratio statistic were used to compare different models and determine the best fitting model  A sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the exponential moving average  RESULTS  During the 87-day time-series  relative humidity ranged widely  < 30-98   and temperatures were mild  approximately 11-17 degrees C   The best-fitting  AIC  1 119 64  generalized additive model included 14-day exponential moving averages of 9 00 am temperature  P < 0 001  and 9 00 am relative humidity  P < 0 001   and the interaction between these two weather variables  P < 0 001   Humidity was negatively associated with cases no matter whether temperature was high or low  The effect of lower relative humidity on increased cases was more pronounced below relative humidity of about 70   below this threshold  not only were the effects of humidity pronounced but also the relationship between temperature and cases of the delta variant becomes apparent  CONCLUSIONS  We suggest that the control of COVID-19 outbreaks  specifically those due to the delta variant  is particularly challenging during periods of the year with lower relative humidity and warmer temperatures  In addition to vaccination  stronger implementation of other interventions such as mask-wearing and social distancing might need to be considered during these higher risk periods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937575

9922,INTRODUCTION  COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has disproportionately affected vulnerable populations such as minority racial ethnic groups  Understanding disparities in vaccine intentions and reasons for vaccine hesitancy are important for developing effective strategies for ameliorating racial ethnic COVID-19 inequities  METHODS  Using six waves of the large  nationally representative Census Bureau s Household Pulse Survey data from January 6-March 29  2021  n   459 235   we examined national and state estimates for vaccination intent  defined as receipt of >   1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or definite intent to be vaccinated  by race ethnicity with stratification by household income and age group  In separate logistic regression models  we also examined the interaction between race ethnicity and household income  and race ethnicity and age group  and its association with vaccination intent  Lastly  we examined reasons for not vaccinating by race ethnicity  RESULTS  Vaccination intent differed by racial ethnic group  household income  and age group nationally and by Health and Human Services  HHS  region and state  A significant interaction was observed between race ethnicity and household income  F 8 72    4 50  p < 0 001   and race ethnicity and age group  F 8 72    15 66  p < 0 001   Non-Hispanic Black adults with lower income  < 35 000  and younger age  18-49 years  were least likely to intend to vaccinate  Similar disparities across racial ethnic groups were seen across most HHS regions and states  Concerns about possible side effects and effectiveness were significantly higher among all minority groups compared to non-Hispanic White adults  CONCLUSION  Disparities in vaccination intent by racial ethnic groups underscore the need for interventions and recommendations designed to improve vaccination coverage and confidence in underserved communities  such as younger and lower income racial ethnic minority groups  Efforts to reduce disparities and barriers to vaccination are needed to achieve equity in vaccination coverage  and ultimately  to curb COVID-19 transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852946
6754,The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major social and economic challenge globally  Infections from infected surfaces have been identified as drivers of Covid-19 transmission  but many epidemiological models do not include an environmental component to account for indirect transmission  We formulate a deterministic Covid-19 model with both direct and indirect transmissions  The computed basic reproduction number R 0 represents the average number of secondary direct human-to-human infections  and the average number of secondary indirect infections from the environment  Using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient  we compute sensitivity indices of the basic reproductive number R 0   As expected  the most significant parameter to reduce initial disease transmission is the natural death rate of pathogens in the environment  Variation of the basic reproduction number for different values of direct and indirect transmissions are numerically investigated  Decreasing the effective direct human-to-human contact rate and indirect transmission from human-to-environment will decrease the spread of the disease as R 0 decreases and vice versa  Since the effective contact rate often accounted for as a factor of the force of infection and other interventions measures such as treatment rate are prominent features of infectious diseases  we consider several functional forms of the incidence function  and numerically investigate their potential impact on the long-term dynamics of the disease  Simulations results revealed some differences for the time and infection to reach its peak  Thus  the choice of the functional form of the force of infection should mainly be influenced by the specifics of the prevention measures being implemented,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901380

6487,BACKGROUND  Little is known about the potential impact of COVID-19 disease containment measures on children s mental health and well-being  particularly in low- and middle-income countries  We sought to explore this amongst young adolescents in South Africa and from the perspectives of multiple key stakeholders  METHODS  We conducted 25 individual semi-structured telephonic interviews with children  n   7  aged 12-13 years   teachers  n   8   parents caregivers  n   7  and school counsellors  n   3  from two public primary schools in the Western Cape  South Africa  Interviews were conducted between July and September 2020 and transcribed verbatim  The data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis procures  RESULTS  We generated three overarching themes   locked down at home    social disconnection  and  back to school   Children had varying reactions to COVID-19 and lockdown including excitement  frustration  anxiety  boredom and loneliness  Parents were anxious about teaching  and technology did not consistently provide the necessary support  Children felt disconnected from their peers at home  and at school  reconnecting with friends was obstructed by disease containment measures  All participants were concerned about children completing the academic year successfully and worried excessively about the implications of this year on their future  CONCLUSION  Young people and their immediate networks  in a low- and middle-income context  described a variety of negative impacts of disease containment measures emotionally  although there was a wide variety of experiences  Children  parents  teachers and counsellors all wanted resources and support and were concerned about the longer-term impacts of disease containment measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904360
2777,Physiological measures  such as heart rate variability  HRV  and beats per minute  BPM   can be powerful health indicators of respiratory infections  HRV and BPM can be acquired through widely available wrist-worn biometric wearables and smartphones  Successive abnormal changes in these indicators could potentially be an early sign of respiratory infections such as COVID-19  Thus  wearables and smartphones should play a significant role in combating COVID-19 through the early detection supported by other contextual data and artificial intelligence  AI  techniques  In this paper  we investigate the role of the heart measurements  i e   HRV and BPM  collected from wearables and smartphones in demonstrating early onsets of the inflammatory response to the COVID-19  The AI framework consists of two blocks  an interpretable prediction model to classify the HRV measurements status  as normal or affected by inflammation  and a recurrent neural network  RNN  to analyze users  daily status  i e   textual logs in a mobile application   Both classification decisions are integrated to generate the final decision as either  potentially COVID-19 infected  or  no evident signs of infection   We used a publicly available dataset  which comprises 186 patients with more than 3200 HRV readings and numerous user textual logs  The first evaluation of the approach showed an accuracy of 83 34   - 1 68  with 0 91  0 88  0 89 precision  recall  and F1-Score  respectively  in predicting the infection two days before the onset of the symptoms supported by a model interpretation using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations  LIME,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960517
3021,The development of antimicrobial surfaces has become a high priority in recent times  There are two ongoing worldwide health crises  the COVID-19 pandemic provoked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the antibiotic-resistant diseases provoked by bacteria resistant to antibiotic-based treatments  The need for antimicrobial surfaces against bacteria and virus is a common factor to both crises  Most extended strategies to prevent bacterial associated infections rely on chemical based-approaches based on surface coatings or biocide encapsulated agents that release chemical agents  A critical limitation of these chemistry-based strategies is their limited effectiveness in time while grows the concerns about the long-term toxicity on human beings and environment pollution  An alternative strategy to prevent bacterial attachment consists in the introduction of physical modification to the surface  Pursuing this chemistry-independent strategy  we present a fabrication process of surface topographies  one-level  micro  nano  and hierarchical  micro nano  structures  in polypropylene  PP  substrates and discuss how wettability  topography and patterns size influence on its antibacterial properties  Using nanoimprint lithography as patterning technique  we report as best results 82 and 86  reduction in the bacterial attachment of E  coli and S  aureus for hierarchically patterned samples compared to unpatterned reference surfaces  Furthermore  we benchmark the mechanical properties of the patterned PP surfaces against commercially available antimicrobial films and provide evidence for the patterned PP films to be suitable candidates for use as antibacterial functional surfaces in a hospital environment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957348
6673,Viruses are the simplest of pathogens  but possess sophisticated molecular mechanisms to manipulate host behavior  frequently utilizing molecular mimicry  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has been shown to bind to the host receptor neuropilin-1 in order to gain entry into the cell  To do this  the virus utilizes its spike protein polybasic cleavage site  PCS   which mimics the CendR motif of neuropilin-1 s endogenous ligands  In addition to facilitating cell entry  binding to neuropilin-1 has analgesic effects  We discuss the potential impact of neuropilin-1 binding by SARS-CoV-2 in ameliorating sickness behavior of the host  and identify a convergent evolutionary strategy of PCS cleavage and subsequent neuropilin binding in other human viruses  In addition  we discuss the evolutionary leap of the ancestor of SARS-COV-2  which involved acquisition of the PCS thus faciliting binding to the neuropilin-1 receptor  Acquisition of the PCS by the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 appears to have led to pleiotropic beneficial effects including enhancement of cell entry via binding to ACE2  facilitation of cell entry via binding to neuropilin-1  promotion of analgesia  and potentially the formation of decoy epitopes via enhanced shedding of the S1 subunit  Lastly  other potential neuromanipulation strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 are discussed  including interferon suppression and the resulting reduction in sickness behavior  enhanced transmission through neurally mediated cough induction  and reduction in sense of smell,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902063
111,In the summer of 2021  European governments removed most NPIs after experiencing prolonged second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic  Most countries failed to achieve immunization rates high enough to avoid resurgence of the virus  Public health strategies for autumn and winter 2021 have ranged from countries aiming at low incidence by re-introducing NPIs to accepting high incidence levels  However  such high incidence strategies almost certainly lead to the very consequences that they seek to avoid  restrictions that harm people and economies  At high incidence  the important pandemic containment measure  test-trace-isolate-support  becomes inefficient  At that point  the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its numerous harmful consequences can likely only be controlled through restrictions  We argue that all European countries need to pursue a low incidence strategy in a coordinated manner  Such an endeavour can only be successful if it is built on open communication and trust,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005678
6997,This article studies the impact of disease epidemics on the worldwide prevalence of the shadow or the underground economy  The informal sector has low entry barriers and provides an easy short-term option for the supply of goods and services during epidemics when traditional supply lines are cut or strained  Furthermore  the enforcement resources might be directed elsewhere during epidemics  lowering the expected costs of shadow operations  Using data for over 125 nations  we find that the incidence of epidemics positively and significantly contributes to the spread of the underground sector  These findings withstand a series of robustness checks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898973
9919,We describe the case of a 30-year-old man who presented to our institution with hypoxia and widespread pulmonary infiltrates managed initially as COVID-19 before receiving a new diagnosis of HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma  KS  with widespread pulmonary and skeletal involvement  Initial differential diagnoses included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia  disseminated mycobacterial infection and bacillary angiomatosis  A bone marrow biopsy showed heavy infiltration by spindle cells  staining strongly positive for human herpes virus-8  HHV-8  and CD34  suggesting symptomatic  disseminated KS as the unifying diagnosis  The patient commenced cytotoxic therapy with weekly paclitaxel  with a clinical and radiological response  To our knowledge  this case is among the most severe described in the literature  which we discuss  along with how COVID-19 initially hindered developing a therapeutic allegiance with the patient,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853045
7757,With the COVID-19 pandemic  clinicians  researchers  industry leaders  and federal regulators in oncology have had to adapt to an evolving landscape of patient care and trial management  At the 2021 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting  several experts discussed some of the lessons learned along the way  and advocated for more decentralized  or virtual  clinical trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887260
1490,As an essential enzyme to SARS-CoV-2  main protease  M  Pro    is a viable target to develop antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19  By varying chemical compositions at both P2 and P3 sites and the N -terminal protection group  we synthesized a series of M  Pro  inhibitors that contain beta - S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl -alaninal at the P1 site  These inhibitors have a large variation of determined IC 50 values that range from 4 8 to 650 nM  The determined IC 50 values reveal that relatively small side chains at both P2 and P3 sites are favorable for achieving high in vitro M  Pro  inhibition potency  the P3 site is tolerable toward unnatural amino acids with two alkyl substituents on the alpha -carbon  and the inhibition potency is sensitive toward the N -terminal protection group  X-ray crystal structures of M  Pro  bound with 16 inhibitors were determined  All structures show similar binding patterns of inhibitors at the M  Pro  active site  A covalent interaction between the active site cysteine and a bound inhibitor was observed in all structures  In M  Pro    large structural variations were observed on residues N142 and Q189  All inhibitors were also characterized on their inhibition of M  Pro  in 293T cells  which revealed their in cellulo potency that is drastically different from their in vitro enzyme inhibition potency  Inhibitors that showed high in cellulo potency all contain O - tert -butyl-threonine at the P3 site  Based on the current and a previous study  we conclude that O - tert -butyl-threonine at the P3 site is a key component to achieve high cellular and antiviral potency for peptidyl aldehyde inhibitors of M  Pro    This finding will be critical to the development of novel antivirals to address the current global emergency of concerning the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981047
5945,Introduction  COVID-19 disease affects newborns  but its middle and long-term effects are still unclear  Objective  To describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and follow-up of newborns infected with SARS-CoV-2  Methods  An observational and descriptive study  We included newborns with SARS-CoV-2 positive RT-PCR born from SARS-CoV-2 seropositive mothers  Delivery and newborn care were provided at the  Instituto Nacional Materno Perinatal  from Peru between June 1 and September 30  2020  Perinatal information was collected from medical records  Remote follow-up and face-to-face evaluations gathered epidemiological and clinical information  in addition to serological and RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2  Descriptive statistics were used for analysis  Results  During the study period  4733 neonates were born at the institution  We found that 1488  31 4   were born from seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 mothers  Finally  we included the 34  2 3   newborns with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2  Regarding the included newborns  29 4  were delivered by cesarean section  26 5  had low birth weight  11 8  were preterm  26 5  were hospitalized  and one died  Twenty-eight had a remote follow-up  and 18 also had a face-to-face follow-up  A total of 64 3  were exclusively breastfed  28 6  were mixed breastfed  and 7 1  used a substitute formula  The face-to-face evaluation was performed between one and four months of chronological age  We found that 100  had negative control RT-PCR test for COVID-19  38 9  had a negative serological test  IgM  IgG   and 61 1  positive IgG  Conclusions  Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is rare  and most infected infants are asymptomatic  Vaginal delivery  breastfeeding  and joint isolation did not related with complications during hospital care  Infants under remote and in-person follow-up showed favorable clinical evolution during the study period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910718
2861,Little is known about the differences in coronavirus disease  COVID-19  vaccine acceptance and hesitancy between the general population and healthcare workers in Japan  To compare these differences  a nationwide web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 19 January 2021  shortly before the initiation of COVID-19 vaccinations in Japan  A total of 6180 men and women aged 20-69 years and 1030 healthcare workers aged 20-69 years were enrolled  Data on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance  basic characteristics  including socioeconomic factors  and confidence in immunization in general were collected  COVID-19 vaccine acceptance was also evaluated under hypothetical vaccine effectiveness and adverse event frequencies  Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis  The COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 48 6  among the general population and was lower among nurses  45 5   and medical clerks  40 7    Women and young adults had significantly higher COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy odds ratios  and current smokers had significantly lower odds ratios  The frequency of adverse events was a COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy factor  Even if these factors were adjusted  COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among nurses was 1 4 times higher than that among the general population  Thus  interventions to improve health literacy and vaccine hesitancy among the general population and healthcare workers  especially nurses  are needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960135
4335,PURPOSE  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the delivery of healthcare in the United States and globally  The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on common ophthalmic procedure utilization and normalization to pre-pandemic daily rates  METHODS  Leveraging a national database  Clinformatics DataMart  OptumInsight  Eden Prairie  MN   procedure frequencies and daily averages  defined by Current Procedural Terminology codes  of common elective and non-elective procedures within multiple ophthalmology sub-specialties were calculated  Interrupted time-series analysis with a Poisson regression model and smooth spline functions was used to model trends in pre-COVID-19  January 1  2018-February 29  2020  and COVID-19  March 1  2020-June 30  2020  periods  RESULTS  Of 3 583 231 procedures in the study period  339 607 occurred during the early COVID-19 time period  Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections  44 412 to 39 774  RR 1 01  CI 0 99-1 02  p    212   retinal detachment repairs  1 290 to 1 086  RR 1 07  CI 0 99-1 15  p    103   and glaucoma drainage implants trabeculectomies  706 to 487  RR 0 93  CI 0 83-1 04  p    200  remained stable  Cataract surgery  61 421 to 33 054  RR 0 77  CI 0 76-0 78  p <  001   laser peripheral iridotomy  1 875 to 890  RR 0 82  CI 0 76-0 88  p <  001   laser trabeculoplasty  2 680 to 1 753  RR 0 79  CI 0 74-0 84  p <  001   and blepharoplasty  1 522 to 797  RR 0 71  CI 0 66-0 77  p <  001  all declined significantly  All procedures except laser iridotomy returned to pre-COVID19 rates by June 2020  CONCLUSION  Most ophthalmic procedures that significantly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic were elective procedures  Among these  the majority returned to 2019 daily averages by June 2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935591
5356,BACKGROUND  Safeguarding the psychological well-being of healthcare workers  HCWs  is crucial to ensuring sustainability and quality of healthcare services  During the COVID-19 pandemic  HCWs may be subject to excessive mental stress  We assessed the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs early in the pandemic in referral hospitals involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in Uganda  METHODS  We conducted a cross-sectional survey in five referral hospitals from April 20-May 22  2020  During this time  we distributed paper-based  self-administered questionnaires to all consenting HCWs on day shifts  The questionnaire included questions on socio-demographics  occupational behaviors  potential perceived risks  and psychological distress  We assessed risk perception towards COVID-19 using 27 concern statements with a four-point Likert scale  We defined psychological distress as a total score > 12 from the 12-item Goldberg s General Health Questionnaire  GHQ-12   We used modified Poisson regression to identify factors associated with psychological distress  RESULTS  Among 335 HCWs who received questionnaires  328  98   responded  Respondents  mean age was 36  range 18-59  years  172  52   were male  The median duration of professional experience was eight  range 1-35  years  208  63   worked more than 40 h per week  116  35   were nurses  52  14   doctors  30  9   clinical officers  and 86  26   support staff  One hundred and forty-four  44   had a GHQ-12 score > 12  The most common concerns reported included fear of infection at the workplace  81    stigma from colleagues  79    lack of workplace support  63    and inadequate availability of personal protective equipment  PPE   56    In multivariable analysis  moderate  adjusted prevalence ratio   aPR    2 2  95  confidence interval  CI  1 2-4 0  and high  aPR   3 8  95  CI 2 0-7 0  risk perception towards COVID-19  compared with low-risk perception  were associated with psychological distress  CONCLUSIONS  Forty-four percent of HCWs surveyed in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients during the early COVID-19 epidemic in Uganda reported psychological distress related to fear of infection  stigma  and inadequate PPE  Higher perceived personal risk towards COVID-19 was associated with increased psychological distress  To optimize patient care during the pandemic and future outbreaks  workplace management may consider identifying and addressing HCW concerns  ensuring sufficient PPE and training  and reducing infection-associated stigma,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920763

7034,Social media trust and sharing behaviors have considerable implications on how risk is being amplified or attenuated at early stages of pandemic outbreaks and may undermine subsequent risk communication efforts  A survey conducted in February 2020 in the United States examined factors affecting information sharing behaviors and social amplification or attenuation of risk on Twitter among U S  citizens at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak  Building on the social amplification of risk framework  SARF   the study suggests the importance of factors such as online discussion  information seeking behaviors  blame and anger  trust in various types of Twitter accounts and misinformation concerns in influencing the spread of risk information during the incipient stages of a crisis when the publics rely primarily on social media for information  An attenuation of risk was found among the US public  as indicated by the overall low sharing behaviors  Findings also imply that  dis trust and misinformation concerns on social media sources  and inconsistencies in early risk messaging may have contributed to the attenuation of risk and low risk knowledge among the US publics at the early stage of the outbreak  further problematizing subsequent risk communication efforts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898837
1281,Background  Ethiopia has received 2 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access  COVAX  facility and planned to vaccinate 20  of its population by the end of 2021  However  evidence on the current uptake of the vaccine in our country is scanty  Therefore  this study aimed to assess COVID-19 vaccine uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia  Methods  A national online cross-sectional E-survey was conducted on COVID-19 vaccine Uptake and associated factors among health professionals in Ethiopia from June 1 to 30  2021  A semi-structured questionnaire was created on Google forms and disseminated online  The snowball sampling technique through the authors  network with Ethiopian residents on the popular social media like Facebook  telegram  and email was used  Descriptive statistics were performed  Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25  and all variables with P-value <0 05 and adjusted odds ratio at 95  CI were used to declare the predictors of the outcome variable  Results  A total of 522 health professionals participated in the survey  of which about 324  62 1   of them were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines at least once  The study indicated that COVID-19 vaccine uptake was associated with age range from 35 to 44 years  AOR   12 97  95  CI  2 36-71 21   age beyond 45 years  AOR   18 95  95  CI   2 04-36 29   being male  AOR   2 91  95  CI   1 05 8 09   being only an academician  AOR   0 23  95  CI  0 10-0 49   academicians working in University hospitals  AOR   0 19  95  CI  0 05-0 83   perceiving their family as healthy  AOR   4 40  95  CI  2 21-8 75   no history of receiving other vaccine before as an adult  AOR   4 07  95  CI  2 07-8 01  and no history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients or clients  AOR   0 42  95  CI  0 20-0 86   Conclusion  The study found that COVID-19 vaccine uptake among health professionals was low  This was not sufficient to achieve herd immunity as at least nine out of ten health professionals are required for herd immunity  Ages  sex  place of work  perceived family health status  previous experience of receiving a vaccine as an adult and history of contact with COVID-19 clients or patients were the factors that influence the vaccine uptake among health professionals in Ethiopia  Hence  decision makers and health managers should consider instituting mandatory vaccination for health professionals and design strategies for the provision of the vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984008
1746,Introduction  Until today  the role of children in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be dynamic and is not finally resolved  The primary aim of this study is to investigate the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in child day care centers and connected households as well as transmission-related indicators and clinical symptoms among children and adults  Methods and Analysis  COALA   Corona outbreak-related examinations in day care centers   is a day care center- and household-based study with a case-ascertained study design  Based on day care centers with at least one reported case of SARS-CoV-2  we include one- to six-year-old children and staff of the affected group in the day care center as well as their respective households  We visit each child s and adult s household  During the home visit we take from each household member a combined mouth and nose swab as well as a saliva sample for analysis of SARS-CoV-2-RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  real-time RT-PCR  and a capillary blood sample for a retrospective assessment of an earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection  Furthermore  information on health status  socio-demographics and COVID-19 protective measures are collected via a short telephone interview in the subsequent days  In the following 12 days  household members  or parents for their children  self-collect the same respiratory samples as described above every 3 days and a stool sample for children once  COVID-19 symptoms are documented daily in a symptom diary  Approximately 35 days after testing the index case  every participant who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study is re-visited at home for another capillary blood sample and a standardized interview  The analysis includes secondary attack rates  by age of primary case  both in the day care center and in households  as well as viral shedding dynamics  including the beginning of shedding relative to symptom onset and viral clearance  Discussion  The results contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological and virological transmission-related indicators of SARS-CoV-2 among young children  as compared to adults and the interplay between day care and households,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976930
6955,Research Summary  This paper studies the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown on criminal activity in the City of Buenos Aires  Argentina  Following quarantine restrictions  we find a large  significant  robust  and immediate decline in property crime reported to official agencies  police arrests  and crime reported in victimization surveys  We observe no significant change in homicides  and a significant increase in arrests for  resistance to authorities   The decrease in criminal activity was greater in business and transportation areas  but still large in commercial and residential areas  including informal settlements   After the sharp and immediate fall  crime recovered but  by the end of 2020  it had not reached its initial levels  The arrest data additionally shows a reduction in the distance from the detainee s address to the crime location  and a fall in the number of detainees from outside the City of Buenos Aires  Crime became more local as mobility was restricted  Policy Implications  We find no evidence that the reduction in the number of detainees from outside the City of Buenos Aires led to a displacement of crimeto suburban areas  This result aligns with the hypothesis that focalized place-based interventions have the potential to reduce overall crime rates  Moreover  the increase in arrests for  resistance to authorities  at the checkpoints set up during the lockdown shows that the enforcement of mobility restrictions can cause frictions between citizens and police  negatively affecting police s legitimacy  We also find that the increased government presence for the provision of health and social services in informal settlements during the pandemic led  as a positive externality  to an additional decrease in crime,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899091
1425,The management of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis and SARS-CoV-2 presents a clinical challenge  We report on the first case of a patient with acute severe ulcerative colitis and mild coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  who received rescue infliximab therapy  followed by a relapse caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli 0157 H7  The treatment challenges we faced were biologic therapy administration during active COVID-19  about which little was known at the time  and how to treat EHEC due to the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome  Acute severe ulcerative colitis was treated with rescue infliximab therapy  and enteric infection with an antibiotic  both with satisfactory clinical response  The decision to induce biologic therapy for inflammatory bowel disease relapse in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients should be made on a case-to-case basis and should be driven by the dominant disease  Our patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2  but actually had mild disease  At the same time  she had acute severe ulcerative colitis  so we started anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy despite serological tests and the recommendation to delay biological therapy administration for two-weeks  Second  due to severity of the first flare  COVID-19  and the patient s general condition  we opted for an antibiotic treatment of Escherichia coli 0157 H7 while monitoring the parameters of potential hemolytic uremic syndrome development,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981697
247,While the immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has been characterized in several well-conducted clinical trials  real-world evidence concerning immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  raised by such vaccines is currently missing  Here  we comprehensively characterized various parameters of SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular and humoral immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in 126 individuals under real-world conditions  After two doses of vaccination  S-receptor binding domain IgG  S-RBD IgG  and neutralizing antibody  NAb  were detected in 87 06   74 85  and 78 82   67 85  of individuals  respectively  Female participants developed higher concentrations of S-RBD IgG and NAb compared to male vaccinees  Interestingly  a longer dosing interval between the first and second vaccination resulted in a better long-term SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD IgG response  The frequencies of CD4  T cells that produce effector cytokines  IFN-gamma  IL-2  and TNF-alpha  in response to stimulation with peptide pools corresponding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S   nucleocapsid  N  or membrane  M  protein were significantly higher in individuals received two doses of vaccine than those received one dose of vaccine and unvaccinated individuals  S  N  or M-specific CD4  and CD8  T cell responses were detectable in 95 83   69 72  and 54 16   39 72  of double-vaccinated individuals  respectively  The longitudinal analysis demonstrated that CD4  T cell responses recognizing S  N  and M waned quickly after a single vaccine dose  but were boosted and became more sustained following a second dose  Overall  we provide a comprehensive characterization of immune responses induced by inactivated COVID-19 vaccines in real-world settings  suggesting that both humoral and cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity are elicited in the majority of individuals after two doses of inactivated COVID-19 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003131
3187,Background  Microbial drug resistance is one of the biggest public health problems  Antibiotic consumption is an essential factor for the emergence and spread of multiresistant bacteria  Therefore  we aimed to analyze the antibiotics consumption in the Intensive Care Unit  ICU   identifying trends in the antibiotics use profile and microbiological isolates throughout the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  We performed this retrospective observational study in intensive care units of a Brazilian tertiary hospital from January 2019 to December 2020  The primary outcome was antimicrobial consumption in the ICU  measured by defined daily doses  DDDs  per 100 bed-days  As a secondary outcome  bacterial infections  microbiological isolates  were calculated in the same fashion  Outcomes trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models  considering constant variance  homoscedasticity  and first-order autocorrelation assumptions  A monthly percent change  MPC  was estimated for each analyzed segment  Results  Seven thousand and nine hundred fifty-three patients had data available on prescribed and received medications and were included in the analyses  Overall  the use of antibiotics increased over time in the ICU  The reserve group  World Health Organization Classification  had an increasing trend  MPC   7 24  from February to April 2020  The azithromycin consumption  J01FA  increased rapidly  with a MPC of 5 21 from January to April 2020  Polymyxin B showed a relevant increase from March to June 2020  MPC   6 93   The peak of the antibiotic consumption of Reserve group did not overlap with the peak of the pathogenic agents they are intended to treat  Conclusion  Overall antimicrobial consumption in ICU has increased in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  The peaks in the antimicrobial s use were not associated with the rise of the pathogenic agents they intended to treat  indicating an empirical use  which is especially concerning in the context of treating multidrug-resistant  MDR  infections  This fact may contribute to the depletion of the therapeutic arsenal for MDR treatment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955847
3614,The COVID-19 pandemic has tested the performance of hospitals and intensive care units around the world  Health care workers  HCWs  have been used to developmental symptoms  but this was especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic when HCWs have been faced with many other sources of stress and anxiety that can usually be avoided  Moreover  long-term shifts and unprecedented population restrictions have weakened people s ability to cope with stress  The research aims to observe the dynamic interplay between burnout  depression  distress  and anxiety in HCWs working in various settings  with specific a focus on emotional exhaustion  depersonalization  and a diminished sense of personal achievement in mediating a worse mental health status during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy  We performed a mediation analysis  which resulted in a strong correlation among depression  psychological distress  health perception and anxiety  and the impact of job burnout on anxiety  depression  and distress  Gender seemed to have a strong correlation with burnout  anxiety  and distress  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Quality of Life seemed to affect anxiety and depression  the possible changes in job tasks and duties  intended as a change in work area or location and role change influenced depression and job burnout  Encouraging supportive and educational strategies would be recommended to policymakers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948696
3717,BACKGROUND  After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  social restriction measures were implemented  among them  the adaptation of university teaching to online modality until the end of the 2019-2020 school year in order to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus  At the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year  the Spanish universities opted for face-to-face teaching  To that end  different special measures and adaptations were implemented in higher education facilities  aimed at minimizing the risk of infection and ensuring safe face-to-face learning  The objective was to explore and describe the level of fear of first-year students after the start of in-person classes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  The sample was 185 first-year students who were evaluated on the first day of class  For that purpose  an ad-hoc questionnaire was administered to collect demographic information and to find the level of fear and concern  The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to assess the severity of the participants  fear of the pandemic situation  RESULTS  The results indicate that participating university population does not report fear of the virus  but they describe various psychosomatic characteristics  such as increased pulse rate and heart palpitations  p   0 008  and insomnia  p   0 05  when they think about infection with coronavirus  Nevertheless  when data are disaggregated by gender  we observe differences specifically in women  83 2    such as fear  p   0 006  and sweaty hands when they think of the virus  p   0 023   CONCLUSIONS  Incoming university freshmen do not express concern or fear of potential infection with COVID-19  but they are concerned about family transmission after beginning face-to-face classes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946348
6974,COVID-19 has caused disruptions in the sharing economy for both platforms and owners  who are typically micro-businesses  Lower demand and ample supply means that users have a great deal of choice  Finding ways for properties to differentiate themselves has been a pressing need  Against this background  this paper pursued two objectives  firstly to explore the perceived functional and emotional value of smart accommodation and the factors contributing to this by adopting the Theory of Consumption Values  and secondly to examine the role of perceived value in driving intention to stay in smart accommodation in the future  430 responses were collected to analyse the relationships among antecedents  value and intention  The results showed that the functional value of smart accommodation is associated with the perception that such accommodation represents good value for the price  smart devices are useful  they can enhance control of stay experiences  and there are resources and opportunities facilitating the use of technology  Emotional value is determined by the perception that staying in smart accommodation represents sustainable behaviour  the integration of smart home technologies offers control over the stay experience  improves the entertainment experience  aesthetics and playfulness of using technology  Emotional values are inhibited by the perception of surveillance in smart accommodation  Also  the study offers evidence of the correlation of intention with functional and emotional value  The evidence contributes to the literature by explaining the potential implications of innovative technologies for business recovery in the post-pandemic reality  exploring the applications of smart technologies in delivering tourism services  and identifying the factors in the adoption of smart homes in the hospitality sector  The findings provide practical implications for facilitating the applications of innovative technology and its adoption in home and non-home environments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899040

1615,BACKGROUND  Disease severity among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 varies remarkably  Preliminary studies reported that the ABO blood group system confers differential viral susceptibility and disease severity caused by SARS-CoV-2  Thus  differences in ABO blood group phenotypes may partly explain the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity patterns  and could help identify individuals at increased risk  Herein  we explored the association between ABO blood group phenotypes and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in a Saudi Arabian cohort  METHODS  In this retrospective cohort study  we performed ABO typing on a total of 373 Saudi patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and conducted association analysis between ABO blood group phenotype and COVID-19 infection severity  We then performed gender-stratified analysis by dividing the participating patients into two groups by gender  and classified them according to age  RESULTS  The frequencies of blood group phenotypes A  B  AB and O were 27 3  23 6  5 4 and 43 7   respectively  We found that blood group phenotype O was associated with a lower risk of testing positive for COVID-19 infection  OR 0 76 95  CI 0 62-0 95  p   0 0113   while blood group phenotype B was associated with higher odds of testing positive  OR 1 51 95  CI 1 17-1 93  p   0 0009   However  blood group phenotype B was associated with increased risk in the mild and moderate group but not the severe COVID-19 infection group  Blood group phenotype O was protective in all severity groups  CONCLUSION  Our findings provide evidence that blood group phenotype B is a risk for COVID-19 disease while blood group phenotype O is protective from COVID-19 infection  However  further studies are necessary to validate these associations in a larger sample size and among individuals of different ethnic groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978705
9510,The COVID-19 pandemic struck the world unawares  The virus is now spreading as never before  despite the initial progress recorded by several countries towards kerbing the pandemic  As the pandemic continues to spread across Africa  there is a need for countries in the continent to re-evaluate  re-strategise  and re-invigorate their COVID-19 responses and efforts based on lessons from the first wave  and Nigeria is no exception  Before the second wave was officially announced by the health authorities on 17 December 2020  there were 78 434 confirmed cases and 1221 deaths reported with a case fatality rate  CFR  of 1 6   To ensure that Nigeria achieves total pandemic control and reacts better given the possibility of a second wave  we propose workable recommendations to strengthen our preparedness and readiness efforts  Here  we argue that lessons learnt from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic can help Nigeria better react to the second wave,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859489
4339,PURPOSE  The purpose of this study is to survey parents of youth with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic with school closures to better understand the implications of the school day on health care behaviors  METHODS  A cross-sectional  online survey was distributed to parents of youth with type 1 diabetes <  19 years of age in a large  academic diabetes center  Questions encompassed perceived changes in management behaviors and plans for return to school  Subgroup analysis compared parent responses by child s age  reported stressors  and socioeconomic markers  RESULTS  Parents reported a worsening in their child s diabetes health behaviors during school closures compared to what they perceived during a regular school day before the pandemic  More than half of parents reported feeling that their child was unable to maintain a normal routine  with particular implications for snacking between meals  daily physical activity  and sleep habits  Families with adolescents or those experiencing multiple pandemic-related stressors reported greater challenges  In open-ended responses  families highlighted difficulty in balancing school  work  and diabetes care and expressed concerns about the mental health repercussions of school closures for their children  Nearly half of parents reported being at least moderately worried about return to school  whereas only a minority reported seeking guidance from their diabetes provider  CONCLUSIONS  Parent-reported disruptions of school-day routines frequently had adverse consequences for diabetes management in this population  These findings highlight the importance of a school-day routine for children with type 1 diabetes  during closures  families may benefit from mitigating strategies to maintain effective habits,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935539

9275,BACKGROUND  Healthcare-acquired COVID-19 has been an additional burden on hospitals managing increasing numbers of patients with SARS-CoV-2  One acute hospital  W  among three in a Scottish healthboard experienced an unexpected surge of COVID-19 clusters  AIM  To investigate possible causes of COVID-19 clusters at Hospital W  METHODS  Daily surveillance provided total numbers of patients and staff involved in clusters in three acute hospitals  H  M and W  and care homes across the healthboard  All clusters were investigated and documented  along with patient boarding  community infection rates and outdoor temperatures from October 2020 to March 2021  Selected SARS-CoV-2 strains were genotyped  FINDINGS  There were 19 COVID-19 clusters on 14 wards at Hospital W during the six-month study period  lasting from two to 42 days  average  five days  median  14 days  and involving an average of nine patients  range 1-24  and seven staff  range 0-17   COVID-19 clusters in Hospitals H and M reflected community infection rates  An outbreak management team implemented a control package including daily surveillance  ward closures  universal masking  screening  restricting staff and patient movement  enhanced cleaning  and improved ventilation  Forty clusters occurred across all three hospitals before a January window-opening policy  after which there were three during the remainder of the study  CONCLUSION  The winter surge of COVID-19 clusters was multi-factorial  but clearly exacerbated by moving trauma patients around the hospital  An extended infection prevention and control package including enhanced natural ventilation helped reduce COVID-19 clusters in acute hospitals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863874
6109,The shift to telehealth due to COVID-19 revealed that a new care model for the young athlete  which combines in-person and virtual visits  could be an enhancement to in-person care alone  This clinical suggestion is novel as it discusses the utility of a hybrid care model for the young athlete  which has not yet been described  Interacting with the patient and family virtually in the home environment offers benefits that are difficult to achieve in the clinic  Opportunities such as the ability to custom tailor the home program with consideration of the patient s learning abilities  provide movement quality feedback outside of the clinical environment  observe parent caregiver feedback  involve family members who may not be available to attend in-person visits  and the possibility of converting an in-person cancelation to a telehealth visit in order to maintain continuity of care  are examples of how this model may optimize treatment  Consideration of investigating the impact on clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness is recommended  Level of Evidence  5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909263
5206,AIMS  Over a million confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease  COVID-19  across 16 European countries were observed during the first wave of the pandemic  Epidemiological measures like the case fatality rate  CFR  are generally used to determine the severity of the illness  The aim is to investigate the impact of the age structure of reported cases on the reported CFR and possibilities of its demographic adjustment for a better cross-country comparison  age-standardized CFRs  time delay between cases detection and death   METHODS  This longitudinal study uses prospective  population-based data covering 150 days  starting on the day of confirmation of the 100th case in each country  COVerAGE-DB and the Human Mortality Database were used in this regard  The age-standardized CFRs were calculated with and without the time delay of the number of deaths after the confirmation of the cases  RESULTS  The observed decline in the CFRs at the end of the first wave is partly given by the changes in the age structure of confirmed cases  Using the adjusted  age-standardized  CFRs with time delay  the risk of death among confirmed cases is much more stable in comparison to crude  observed  CFRs  CONCLUSIONS  Preventing the spread of COVID-19 among the elderly is an important way to positively influence the overall fatality rate  decrease the number of deaths  and not overload the health systems  The crude CFRs  still often presented  are not sufficient for a proper evaluation of the development across populations nor as a means of identifying the influencing factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923870

2716,The use of plants as biofactories for the production of medical products and vaccines has a long history  but the recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused this set of technologies  for their potential to contribute to the development of innovative solutions for tackling pandemic spread worldwide  to rise in prominence  The purpose of this paper is to analyze the global innovation scenario of plant-based vaccine production  METHODS  Patent search using a specific set of technical classification codes and keywords was performed using the Questel-Orbit database  with a final output of 180 patent families  corresponding to 1397 single patents  RESULTS  Plant-based vaccines production is an innovation sector with positive development especially in the last five-year period  30  growth   Fifty percent of the patents were registered in the United States  standing out as the most attractive patent system worldwide  The inventive activity was led by private firms owning the 49  of the patent families  and the key-players group includes the companies that successfully developed plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidates  indicating a strong connection between the expertise in innovation production and the capacity to adapt inventions to the current pandemic vaccine demand  Virus-like particles technology has increased in importance over the past few years  CONCLUSION  Patent data confirm their relevant role as indicators of innovation and technological evolution  Plant-based vaccines are expected to acquire an increasing role over the next few years as the current pandemic acts as an innovation catalyst,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961028
3011,Background  There are more than 206 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection globally  Nasopharyngeal swab testing is one of the widely used diagnostic methods for the initial diagnosis of such cases  With the growing diagnostic testing capacity  it is expected to observe an increased number of adverse events due to nasopharyngeal testing  Clinical presentation  A middle-aged woman presented with unilateral rhinorrhea  started after nasopharyngeal swab test for Covid-19  She had no prior medical issues  Thorough examination and imaging showed the presence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage  Conclusion  Nasopharyngeal swab testing may lead to serious complications and taking a brief history might be helpful  Also  patients should be educated on different complications of nasopharyngeal swab testing and their associated symptoms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957364
9101,Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  now and for years to come  guests at hospitality venues will have heightened awareness with regard to formulating their perceptions of cleanliness  While perceived cleanliness has received attention in our existing body of literature  this conceptual paper integrates potential subconscious influencers on cleanliness perceptions into our understanding  Specifically  findings contained in various streams of research suggest that a number of factors can have subconscious influences on individuals  perceptions of cleanliness in service environments  Such factors include the degree of lighting  the presence of plants   greenery  the shininess of surfaces  the use of ambient scents  the use of white bedding  and the presence of cleaning staff  Evidently  the sooner hospitality venues  particularly airlines  lodging operations  restaurants  and cruise ships  are perceived as clean and safe  the faster they will recover from the pandemic  As such  this paper is rich with both practical and research implications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866740
4028,As of September 2021  there has been a total of 123 633 confirmed cases of pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the US according to the CDC  with maternal death being 2 85 times more likely  pre-eclampsia 1 33 times more likely  preterm birth 1 47 times more likely  still birth 2 84 times more likely  and NICU admission 4 89 times more likely when compared to pregnant women without COVID-19 infection  In our literature review  we have identified eight key changes in the immunological functioning of the pregnant body that may predispose the pregnant patient to both a greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2  as well as a more severe disease course  Factors that may impede immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2 include decreased levels of natural killer  NK  cells  Th1 CD4  T cells  plasmacytoid dendritic cells  pDC   a decreased phagocytic index of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes  as well as the immunomodulatory properties of progesterone  which is elevated in pregnancy  Factors that may exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 morbidity through hyperinflammatory states include increases in the complement system  which are linked to greater lung injury  as well as increases in TLR-1 and TLR-7  which are known to bind to the virus  leading to increased proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha  which are already elevated in normal pregnant physiology  Other considerations include an increase in angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  in the maternal circulation  leading to increased viral binding on the host cell  as well as increased IL-6 and decreased regulatory T cells in pre-eclampsia  We also focus on how the Delta variant has had a concerning impact on SARS-CoV-2 cases in pregnancy  with an increased case volume and proportion of ICU admissions among the infected expecting mothers  We propose that the effects of the Delta variant are due to a combination of  1  the Delta variant itself being more transmissible  contagious  and efficient at infecting host cells   2  initial evidence pointing to the Delta variant causing a significantly greater viral load that accumulates more rapidly in the respiratory system   3  the pregnancy state being more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection  as discussed in-depth  and  4  the lower rates of vaccination in pregnant women compared to the general population  In the face of continually evolving strains and the relatively low awareness of COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women  it is imperative that we continue to push for global vaccine equity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940401

4477,Data visualizations have proliferated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to communicate information about the crisis and influence policy development and individual decision-making  In invoking exponential growth  mathematical modelling  statistical analysis  and the like  these data visualizations invite opportunities for mathematics teaching and learning  Yet data visualizations are social texts  authored from specific points of view  that narrate particular  and often consequential  stories  Their fundamental reliance on quantification and mathematics cements their social positioning as supposedly objective  reliable  and neutral  The reading of any data visualization demands unpacking the role of mathematics  including how data and variables have been formatted and how relationships are framed to narrate stories from particular points of view  We present an approach to a critical reading of data visualizations for the context of mathematics education that draws on three interrelated concepts  mathematical formatting  what gets quantified  measured  and how   framing  how variables are related and through what kind of data visualization   and narrating  which stories the data visualization tells  its potential impacts and limits   This approach to reading data visualisations includes a process of reimagining through reformatting  reframing and renarrating  We illustrate this approach and these three concepts using data visualizations published in the New York Times in 2020 about COVID-19  We offer a set of possible questions to guide a critical reading of data visualizations  beyond this set of examples,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934245
1208,The highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has infected more than 253 million people  claiming approximately 5 1 million lives to date  Although mandatory quarantines  lockdowns  and vaccinations help curb viral transmission  there is a pressing need for cost-effective systems to mitigate the viral spread  Here  we present a generic strategy for capturing SARS-CoV-2 through functionalized cellulose materials  Specifically  we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody  Nb  targeting the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2  The immobilization of the fusion proteins on cellulose substrates enhanced the capture efficiency of Nbs against SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses of the wildtype and the D614G variant  the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity  Furthermore  the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography with highly porous cellulose to capture viruses from complex fluids in a continuous fashion  By capturing and containing viruses through the Nb-functionalized cellulose  our work may find utilities in virus sampling and filtration towards paper-based diagnostics  environmental tracking of viral spread and reducing viral load from infected individuals  IMPORTANCE The ongoing efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic center around the development of diagnostics  preventative measures  and therapeutic strategies  In comparison to existing work  we have provided a complementary strategy to capture SARS-CoV-2 by functionalized cellulose materials towards paper-based diagnostics as well as virus filtration in perishable samples  Specifically  we developed a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of both a cellulose-binding domain and a nanobody specific for the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2  As a proof-of-concept  the fusion protein-coated cellulose substrates exhibited enhanced capture efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus of both wildtype and the D614G mutant variants  the latter of which has been shown to confer higher infectivity  Furthermore  the fusion protein was integrated into a customizable chromatography for binding viruses from complex biological fluids in a highly continuous and cost-effective manner  Such antigen-specific capture can potentially immobilize viruses of interest for viral detection and removal  which contrasts with the common size- or affinity-based filtration devices that bind a broad range of bacteria  viruses  fungi  and cytokines present in blood  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04413955   Additionally  since our work focuses on capturing and concentrating viruses from surfaces and fluids as a means to improve detection  it can serve as an  add-on  technology to complement existing viral detection methods  many of which have been largely focusing on improving the intrinsic sensitivities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985974
3185,During this pandemic Italy was deeply hit by the burden of the COVID-19  Current studies reveal that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 represent the most common manifestations at presentation  The incidence of less common gastrointestinal symptoms varies significantly among different study populations  Liver injury is also described at different degree  We describe the case of a 20-year-old woman confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal swab-PCR test  admitted to the COVID-only-Psychiatric Ward  set up in Niguarda Hospital in Milan on March 2020  for a depressive episode characterized by depressed mood and anorexia  In comorbidity we report a previous avoidant restrictive food intake disorder present since childhood and a Border Personality Disorder according to the DSM V  On the admission to the ward we administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a total score of 29 suggesting severe depression  During the hospitalization she developed a clinical picture with increasing vomiting and diarrhea  nausea  abdominal pain along with fever and no respiratory symptoms  She also showed abnormalities in liver function indices  At the same time she showed clinophilia and persistent food avoidance that  initially  led to attribute all the symptoms to her psychiatric disorders  We prescribed the already ongoing therapy with lithium carbonate and SSRI  On the second day of hospitalization  along with the worsening of the gastrointestinal symptoms  we started therapy with hydroxychloroquine with a no significant remission of nausea and vomiting but with a further increase in liver function indices suggesting liver damage  This led us to suspend the treatment with hydroxychloroquine for the suspect of a drug induced injury  The depressive symptoms improved rapidly as opposed to the patient s overall condition  The gastrointestinal symptoms resolved with the evidence of the recovery from infection  In this report we underline the importance of investigating the physical symptoms in a patient with a history of mental disorder especially during an undergoing pandemic  During this pandemic  specialists from various fields were called upon to support teams working with COVID patients and to acquire new skills out of necessity  fostering a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955904
7753,INTRODUCTION  In South Korea  non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask-wearing  hand washing and social distancing were strictly implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after a national crisis alert was raised to the highest level early in the pandemic  23 February 2020   We aimed to investigate changes in the occurrence of respiratory diseases at the national level after the COVID-19 outbreak  METHODS  The study period was from 1 January to 1 August 2019  213 days  and from 1 January to 31 July 2020  213 days   Based on the National Health Insurance Service data  we analysed changes in the numbers of patients treated for respiratory diseases  The changes in the numbers of individuals using public transportation and visiting the theatre were investigated to assess the effect of social distancing after the national crisis alert was raised  Differences in daily cumulative numbers  DDCNs  in 2020 were calculated as follows   daily cumulative number in 2020 - cumulative number for that day in 2019   A change over time in DDCNs of <0 was taken as indication that the numbers decreased from 2019 to 2020  Segmented regression analyses were performed using generalised least squares method to identify changes in trends of DDCNs of patients treated for respiratory diseases and individuals using public transportation and visiting the theatre  RESULTS  After the national crisis alert was raised to the highest level  DDCNs of patients treated for respiratory diseases  individuals using public transportation  and those visiting the theatre exhibited a significant daily decline by 53 18 per 10 000 inhabitants  95  CI -65 86 to -40 49   48 19 per 1000 inhabitants  95  CI -62 05 to -34 32  and 25 30 per 5000 inhabitants  95  CI -36 30 to -14 30   respectively  compared with before the national crisis alert was raised  CONCLUSION  Non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 significantly reduce the incidence of respiratory diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887303

3094,As vaccination campaigns are in progress in most countries  hopes to win back more normality are rising  However  the exact path from a pandemic to an endemic virus remains uncertain  While in the pre-vaccination phase many critical indoor situations were avoided by strict control measures  for the transition phase a certain mitigation of the effect of indoor situations seems advisable  To better understand the mechanisms of indoor airborne transmissions  we present a new time-discrete model to calculate the level of exposure towards infectious SARS-CoV-2 aerosol and carry out a sensitivity analysis for the level of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol exposure in indoor settings  Time limitations and the use of any kind of masks were found to be strong mitigation measures  while how far the effort for a strict use of professional face pieces instead of simple masks can be justified by the additional reduction of the exposure dose remains unclear  Very good ventilation of indoor spaces is mandatory  The definition of sufficient ventilation in regard to airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission follows other rules than the standards in ventilation design  This means that especially smaller rooms most likely require a significantly greater fresh air supply than usual  Further research on 50  group models in schools is suggested  The benefits of a model in which the students come to school every day  but for a limited time  should be investigated  In terms of window ventilation  it has been found that many short opening periods are not only thermally beneficial  they also reduce the exposure dose  The fresh air supply is driven by the temperature gradient and wind speed  However  the sensitivity towards these parameters is not very high and in times of low wind and temperature gradients  there are no arguments against keep windows open in order to make up for the reduced air flow rate  Long total opening periods and large window surfaces will strongly reduce the exposure  Additionally  the results underline the expectable fact that exposure doses will increase when hygiene and control measures are reduced  It seems advisable to investigate what this means for the infection rate and the fatality of infections in populations with partial immunity  Very basic considerations suggest that the value of aerosol reduction measures may be reduced with very infectious variants such as delta,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956820

2611,Importance  Longitudinal research on specific forms of electronic screen use and mental health symptoms in children and youth during COVID-19 is minimal  Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth  Objective  To determine whether specific forms of screen use  television  TV  or digital media  video games  electronic learning  and video-chatting time  were associated with symptoms of depression  anxiety  conduct problems  irritability  hyperactivity  and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19  Design  Setting  and Participants  A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario  Canada  between May 2020 and April 2021 across 4 cohorts of children or youth  2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts  Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their children s health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19  Main Outcomes and Measures  The exposure variables were children s daily TV or digital media time  video game time  electronic-learning time  and video-chatting time  The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression  anxiety  conduct problems and irritability  and hyperactivity inattention using validated standardized tools  Results  This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations  In younger children  mean  SD  age  5 9  2 5  years  275 male participants  51 7     higher TV or digital media time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems  age 2-4 years  beta  0 22  95  CI  0 10-0 35   P <  001  age >  4 years  beta  0 07  95  CI  0 02-0 11   P    007  and hyperactivity inattention  beta  0 07  95  CI  0 006-0 14   P    04   In older children and youth  mean  SD  age  11 3  3 3  years  844 male participants  56 5     higher levels of TV or digital media time were associated with higher levels of depression  anxiety  and inattention  higher levels of video game time were associated with higher levels of depression  irritability  inattention  and hyperactivity  Higher levels of electronic learning time were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety  Conclusions and Relevance  In this cohort study  higher levels of screen use were associated poor mental health of children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic  These findings suggest that policy intervention as well as evidence-informed social supports are needed to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth during the pandemic and beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962557
1433,Pixatimod  PG545   a heparan sulfate  HS  mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials  is a potent inhibitor of heparanase  Heparanase is an endo -beta-glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections  including SARS-CoV-2  To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase  we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end beta-D-glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation  This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase  revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations  with the cholestanol side-chain making important hydrophobic interactions  While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site  small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded  and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor  This study provides new insights for the design of next-generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981584
9128,From its emergence in December 2019 and until the end of the fourth pandemic wave in October 2021  SARS-CoV-2 circulation has been associated with significant molecular evolutions of the virus  These were linked to mutations that have led to new virus linages with replication advantages as a result of increased transmission  or partial immune escape in the context of progressively increasing global immunisation  The pandemic context with large scale epidemics massive outbreaks observed in highly populated areas has favoured this emergence of  variants   During the 20 months period  at least three evolutionary phases have been observed  leading to the situation observed in October 2021  For the first time  an unprecedented worldwide surveillance effort has been conducted to monitor the circulation of the emerging virus  with rapid data sharing  This molecular surveillance system has provided an accurate description of the circulating viruses  and their evolution  The implementation of these tools and skills able to provide SARS-CoV-2 molecular epidemiological data has upgraded the global capacity for surveillance worldwide  and may allow us to be better prepared for a future pandemic episode,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866635
8762,The health sector is an underutilized source of actionable health intelligence for responding to threats across the  cyber-bionexus   defined as the convergence of threats from the biological and cybersecurity domains to produce harms with widespread societal consequences  The escalation of concerns about such threats-related to misinformation and disinformation  chemical  biological  radiological  and nuclear events  cyberattacks  natural disease outbreaks  and disasters of various kinds-places health system concerns squarely at the forefront of national critical systems and broader security imperatives  Events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the dearth of systems available for generating real-time intelligence in relation to critical functions of health sector operations amidst an unfolding crisis  Drawing on principles from the field of cyberthreat intelligence  and building on existing scholarship in health security intelligence  we propose a model for applying health system indicators of compromise for cyberbio events  We further discuss the relevance of this approach within the broader landscape of the cyber-bionexus to signal new pathways for research  practice  and policy engagement,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870478
4326,OBJECTIVE  This study aims to examine whether there are differences in symptoms of post-traumatic stress  depression  anxiety  levels of burnout and resilience in Spanish healthcare staff between the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and after it  depending on several demographic and work-related variables  METHODS  A longitudinal study was conducted in April 2020  T0   and July 2020  T1   Symptoms of post-traumatic stress  depression  anxiety  burnout  levels of resilience  along with demographic and work-related variables in 443 workers were assessed  RESULTS  Symptoms and burnout were more pronounced at T0  whereas the levels of resilience were higher at T1  Being female  being young  holding a lower-level job  less years of experience  lower educational level and or working rotating shifts are associated with having more post-traumatic stress symptoms and burnout  CONCLUSION  These variables would be considered in similar situations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935681
6872,Both COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and recessionary employment loss severely impacted US food sales during 2020  This article estimates the historical relationship between food expenditures and employment at the county level  Using these estimates  we simulate the impact of the loss of employment on food sales and find that  on average  employment loss increased food-at-home  FAH  sales by 1 3  and decreased food-away-from-home  FAFH  sales by 0 5  in 2020  We argue differences to the actual 4 8  increase in FAH sales and 19 5  decrease in FAFH sales in 2020 likely stem from the more drastic COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and behavioral changes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900207
3305,OBJECTIVE  We consider the role of institutional  cultural  and economic factors on the performance of lockdown measures during the pandemic  Initial studies focusing on the cross-sectional data found an association between low case numbers and a higher level of cultural tightness  Meanwhile  institutional strength and income levels revealed a puzzling negative relationship with the number of cases and death  METHODS  Exploiting the most recent data available until the end of September 2021  we analyze the dynamic impact of these factors on lockdowns  We combine the cross-sectional dimension of the country-level data with the time-series dimension of pandemic related measures  using econometric techniques dealing with panel data  FINDINGS  The stringency of the lockdown measures is associated with less cases  Institutional strength enhances this negative relationship  Countries with well- defined and established laws perform better for a given set of lockdown measures compared to countries with weaker institutional structures  Cultural tightness reduces the performance of lockdowns in contrast to earlier findings at the cross-sectional level  CONCLUSION  Institutional strength dominates over cultural and economic factors in enhancing the performance of lockdowns  Our results underline the importance of strengthening institutions in controlling pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954312
6157,Background  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  governments of many countries announced regulations to prevent the virus from spreading  For people with a disability living in a sheltered care facility in the Netherlands  this meant that they were not able to receive any visitors for almost 3 months  Aim  This study examines how people with an intellectual and visual disability and their families experienced the period in which it was mandated not to have any physical contact  The aim is to examine the experiences of this target group and gain insight in the way measures were taken in order to be able to advise care organizations about adequate care with respect to possible restrictive measures in the future  Methods  In-depth interviews were conducted with two groups of people   1  fourteen people with an intellectual and visual disability  living in sheltered care facilities and  2  twelve people being relatives of residents of these same sheltered care facilities  In the interviews  the participants were questioned about their experiences with respect to the adjusted visiting regulations and with respect to the relation with their family during this period  A thematic analysis was performed first separately and then combined  Results and Discussion  A number of themes resulted from the analysis that were related to  1  the instructed regulations of the sheltered care facilities and the government   2  the relation with family and friends  and  3  the consequences of COVID-19 and the regulations  Both relatives and residents were understanding of the difficult situation  but also expressed criticism about the chosen regulations  the communication thereof  and the practical implementation  Both groups have experienced the interruption of close contact as emotional and difficult  However  also positive consequences of the restrictions due to COVID-19 were mentioned  The results provide a list of recommendations for sheltered care facilities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909049
5749,Coronaviruses are causative agents of different zoonosis including SARS  MERS  or COVID-19 in humans  The high transmission rate of coronaviruses  the time-consuming development of efficient anti-infectives and vaccines  the possible evolutionary adaptation of the virus to conventional vaccines  and the challenge to cover broad human population worldwide are the major reasons that made it challenging to avoid coronaviruses outbreaks  Although  a plethora of different approaches are being followed to design and develop vaccines against coronaviruses  most of them target subunits  full-length single  or only a very limited number of proteins  Vaccine targeting multiple proteins or even the entire proteome of the coronavirus is yet to come  In the present chapter  we will be discussing multi-epitope vaccine  MEV  and multi-patch vaccine  MPV  approaches to design and develop efficient and sustainably successful strategies against coronaviruses  MEV and MPV utilize highly conserved  potentially immunogenic epitopes and antigenic patches  respectively  and hence they have the potential to target large number of coronavirus proteins or even its entire proteome  allowing us to combat the challenge of its evolutionary adaptation  In addition  the large number of human leukocyte antigen  HLA  alleles targeted by the chosen specific epitopes enables MEV and MPV to cover broader global population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914046
2816,Vaccination plays a key role in reducing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases  including the recent COVID-19 pandemic  However  a comprehensive approach that allows the planning of vaccination campaigns and the estimation of the resources required to deliver and administer COVID-19 vaccines is lacking  This work implements a new framework that supports the planning and delivery of vaccination campaigns  Firstly  the framework segments and priorities target populations  then estimates vaccination timeframe and workforce requirements  and lastly predicts logistics costs and facilitates the distribution of vaccines from manufacturing plants to vaccination centres  The outcomes from this study reveal the necessary resources required and their associated costs ahead of a vaccination campaign  Analysis of results shows that by integrating demand stratification  administration  and the supply chain  the synergy amongst these activities can be exploited to allow planning and cost-effective delivery of a vaccination campaign against COVID-19 and demonstrates how to sustain high rates of vaccination in a resource-efficient fashion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960206
3540,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus disease-19  COVID-19  restrictions  particularly relating to the sale of alcohol and hours of curfew  have had a marked effect on the temporal pattern of unnatural deaths in South Africa  Methods  Death data were collected over 68 weeks from January 2020 to April 2021  together with information on the nature of restrictions  if any  on the sale of alcohol  and hours of curfew  Data were analysed using a simple ordinary least square  OLS  regression model to estimate the relative contribution of restrictions on the sale of alcohol and hours of curfew to the pattern of excess unnatural deaths  Results  The complete restriction on the sale of alcohol resulted in a statistically significant reduction in unnatural deaths regardless of the length of curfew  To the contrary  periods where no or limited restrictions on alcohol were in force had no significant effect  or resulted in significantly increased unnatural deaths  Conclusions  The present study highlights an association between alcohol availability and the number of unnatural deaths and demonstrates the extent to which those deaths might be averted by disrupting the alcohol supply  While this is not a long-term solution to addressing alcohol-related harm  it further raises the importance of implementing evidence-based alcohol control measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34949245
3443,BACKGROUND  Jeju island had the seventh highest incidence rate of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  but showed the lowest case fatality rate among 17 provinces of Korea  which may be associated with comorbidities and geographic differences  This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and evaluate the risk factors for severe COVID-19 in Jeju island  Korea  MATERIALS AND METHODS  All patients with COVID-19 admitted between February 20  2020  and June 19  2021  at a single center were retrospectively enrolled in this study  The severity of illness was defined using five categories  asymptomatic  mild  moderate  severe  and critical  according to the National Institute of Health criteria  Then  patients with severe and critical illness were grouped into a severe group  whereas patients with asymptomatic  mild  and moderate illness were grouped into a non-severe group  Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using risk factors that were found to be significantly associated with the severe group  RESULTS  This study included 348 patients with a median age was 57 years  and 37 5  were aged 60 or older  Among them  43 4  were male and 10 9  were asymptomatic  whereas 41 4   33 9   12 9   and 1 1  had mild  moderate  severe  and critical illness  The all-cause mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 0 28   1 348   Among confirmed patients with COVID-19  exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  was mainly within Jeju island  75 9    The mean body mass index was 24 09   - 4 04 kg m 2   the median comorbidity index score was low in each group  0 in asymptomatic  1 in mild  1 in moderate  1 in severe  and 2 in critical group  P <0 548   In the multivariable analysis  male sex  odds ratio  OR   6 37  95  confidence interval  CI   2 69 - 15 13  P <0 001   >  65 years of age  OR  2 68  95  CI  1 18 - 6 10  P <0 019   chronic pulmonary disease  OR  6 10  95  CI  1 40 - 26 61  P   0 016   and length of fever duration  OR  1 33  95  CI  1 19 - 1 49  P <0 001  were independently associated with severe COVID-19  CONCLUSION  The most relevant risk factors of COVID-19 severity were male sex  older age  underlying chronic lung diseases  and duration of fever during hospitalization  The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were not significantly different from those reported in other studies  However  a lower proportion of the older population among confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases might contribute to the lower fatality rate than the national rate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951535
782,COVID-19 pandemic has passed to the front all the contradictions of the beekeeping sector  the valuable role of bee products as immune enhancers and antiviral agents and the impact that unsustainability of human activities has on bees  health and survival  The COVID-19 emergency led several countries to adopt severe restriction measures to contrast the infection  The lowering of industrial and commercial activities  transports  and the general lockdown had immediate consequences on the air quality  significantly improving environmental conditions  This had a positive impact on honeybees  life s quality  On the other hand  the bee and beehive transportation limitations threaten to hit food production by affecting the pollinator service  and this is particularly true in large  food-exporting countries like the USA and China where due to the few numbers of local bees  beekeepers import them by other countries and convey by truck hives for thousands of kilometers to pollinate crops  Furthermore  honeybee products  focusing on their natural pharmacological properties  can play an essential role as a potential natural contrast to the virus by enhancing the immunity defenses of both humans and animals  and their demand by consumers is expected to increase  Several researchers in the last months focused their attention on bee products to evaluate their effect in the cure of COVID-19 patients to ameliorate the symptoms or to contrast the coronavirus directly  This review reports these preliminary results,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993785
1964,Recently  new criteria for the diagnosis of pericarditis have been published  This paper has been thought to point out the limits in the new criteria specificity as well in the application of the new criteria for the diagnosis of pericarditis as recently demonstrated by studies based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  We report the case of A 18y old male with no significant past medical history who presented with complaints of chest pain typical for pericarditis  initially labeled as pericarditis  the patient was evaluated by electrocardiography  trans-thoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging  the condition  based on electrocardiogram and trans-thoracic echocardiography findings  was labeled as pericarditis in keeping with current diagnostic criteria  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated myocardial edema with no T2-defined pericardial inflammation on TIR T2 imaging  late gadolinium enhancement imaging demonstrated multiple irregular  punctate  epicardial zones  The constellation of findings was consistent with acute myocarditis without pericardial involvement  In conclusion  limits in specificity of the newly published criteria for diagnosis of pericarditis  which add to the already demonstrated limits in sensitivity  subsist  Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging plays a unique role in the initial assessment of pericarditis  this is particularly important in the Covid-19 era in light of the increasing incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis  also  the case suggests that the combination of information between advanced echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may have an important diagnostic role in this setting  Additionally  we suggest that despite recent enthusiasm for colchicine  its role may be best defined in those with myocarditis  not pericarditis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973828
8575,Introduction  The Foundation Interim Year-one  FiY1  Programme was part of a UK strategy to increase the medical workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  However  the strategy was introduced urgently without evidence  We sought to explore the transition experience of medical student to FiY1 to foundation doctor  with a view to inform future undergraduate education  Methods  In this hermeneutic phenomenology study  semi-structured individual interviews were completed with nine foundation doctors who had experience of an FiY1 placement  A template analysis approach was taken  and themes reported  Results  Participants reported that FiY1 tended to offer a positive experience of transition as a stepping stone to becoming a foundation doctor  Having a degree of clinical responsibility including the right to prescribe medication with supervision was highly valued  as was feeling a core member of the healthcare team  Participants perceived that FiY1 made them more prepared for the foundation transition  and more resilient to the challenges they faced during their first foundation job  Discussion  The FiY1 fostered many opportunities for junior doctors to bridge the transition to foundation doctor  Aspects of the FiY1 programme  such as early licencing and increased team membership  should be considered for final-year students in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873496
4170,Objectives  While previous research has mainly focused on the impact of the first acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health  little empirical knowledge exists about depression  anxiety  and somatic symptom levels and possible predictors of symptom levels in the pandemic s recovery phase  The present study aimed to analyze the mental burden of a convenience ample of the general German population during the first recovery phase of the pandemic and to identify significant predictors of symptom levels  Methods  Standardized measures of anxiety  GAD-2   depression  PHQ-2   somatic symptoms  PHQ-15   and health anxiety  as well as measures of COVID-19 fears and possible vulnerability factors  were administered through a national  cross-sectional online survey  n   2160  mean age 42 7 years  75  female   asking participants for their current symptom levels and their symptom levels prior to the COVID-19 pandemic  Results  Our findings show significantly elevated levels of depression  anxiety  somatic symptoms  and health anxiety in the recovery period compared to before the pandemic  The current prevalence rates based on self-reporting were 26 7  for depression  24 5  for anxiety  and 29  for somatization  The strongest predictors of these symptom reports included domain-specific pre-existing symptom levels  neuroticism  biological COVID-19 risk factors  avoidance of illness information  and younger age  The most important predictors of COVID-19 fears were subjective COVID-19 risk perception  followed by pre-existing health anxiety  the number of biological COVID-19 risk factors  older age  neuroticism  avoidance of illness information and female gender  Discussion  These findings indicate the need for specific psychological programs to help individuals with enhanced psychological and biological vulnerability to cope better with the mental distress experienced during all phases of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938223

8972,Introduction  Programs that offer early exposure to surgery for medical students foster interest in and positive perceptions of surgery  The COVID-19 pandemic led to suspension of these activities at our institution  the University of Kansas School of Medicine  In response to the lack of virtual alternatives  a pilot virtual surgery enrichment program was implemented for first-year students in place of in-person surgical exposure  The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of in-person and virtual-based surgical education programs to expose preclinical medical students about the surgical realm of medicine  Methods  First-year medical students participated in either a virtual  Group A  or in-person  Group B  week-long surgical enrichment program  Group assignments were dictated by COVID restrictions on each of our three medical school campuses  Salina  Wichita  and Kansas City  Pre- and post-surveys with a 14-question multiple-choice assessment of surgical knowledge were distributed to participants  Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used for statistical analysis  Results  There were 14 participants in Group A and 7 participants in Group B  Both groups improved significantly from pre- to post-assessment score   Group A  p   0 01  Group B  p   0 04   There was no difference between groups in the magnitude of score improvement from pre- to post-assessment  p   0 59   Conclusions  This pilot program demonstrated that virtual platforms can be a method to provide meaningful clinical experiences in surgery to preclinical medical students restricted from clinical activities  Further development of mentorship in virtual surgical programs and assessment of subjective experience is needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868466
5339,INTRODUCTION  The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the entire world with increasing morbidity and mortality and has resulted in serious economic and social consequences  Assessing the burden of COVID-19 is essential for developing efficient pandemic preparedness and response strategies and for determining the impact of implemented control measures  Population-based seroprevalence surveys are critical to estimate infection rates  monitor the progression of the epidemic and to allow for the identification of persons exposed to the infection who may either have been asymptomatic or were never tested  This is especially important for countries where effective testing and tracking systems could not be established and where non-severe cases or under-reported deaths might have blurred the true burden of COVID-19  Most seroprevalence surveys performed in sub-Saharan Africa have targeted specific high risk or more easily accessible populations such as healthcare workers or blood donors  and household-based estimates are rarely available  Here  we present the study protocol for a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence estimation in the general population of Burkina Faso  Ghana and Madagascar in 2021  METHODS AND ANALYSIS  The SeroCoV study is a household-based cross-sectional prevalence investigation in persons aged 10 years and older living in urban areas in six cities using a two-stage geographical cluster sampling method stratified by age and sex  The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies will be determined using a sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA  In addition  questionnaires will cover sociodemographic information  episodes of diseases and history of testing and treatment for COVID-like symptoms  travel history and safety measures  We will estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2  taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of the respective populations  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  Ethical approval was received for all participating countries  Results will be disseminated through reports and presentations at the country level as well as peer-reviewed publications and international scientific conferences presentations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921091
3544,BACKGROUND  The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic led to a 2-month lockdown in Europe  Elective surgeries  including skin cancer excisions  were postponed  The purpose of this prospective case-control study was to assess the impact of the treatment delay on patients with non-melanoma skin cancer  NMSC  or melanoma operated in the first post-lockdown period  METHODS  A comparative study of skin cancer operations performed in a 4-month period either in 2020 or in 2019 was conducted  All data were collected from a prospectively maintained clinic database and the pathological reports  Continuous variables were compared with t test or Mann-Whitney U test according to their distribution  Categorical variables were compared with Fisher exact test  Odds ratio  OR  with 95  confidence interval  95  CI  was used to assess the risk of excising high-risk NMSC in 2020 compared with 2019  RESULTS  Skin cancer excision was performed in 158 cases in 2020 compared to 125 cases in 2019  26 4  increase   Significantly  more SCC were excised in 2020  p   0 024   No significant difference for several clinical parameters regarding BCC  SCC  and melanoma was identified  However  the reconstructive method applied  following NMSC excision  was significantly different  requiring frequently either skin grafting or a flap  CONCLUSION  These results indicate that skin cancer treatment delay  due to COVID-19 pandemic  is related to an increased incidence of SCC and more complicated methods of reconstruction  Considering the relapsing COVID-19 waves  significant skin cancer treatment delays should be avoided  TRIAL REGISTRATION  The study adhered to the STROBE statement for case-control studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34949189
2152,It is partially unknown whether the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection persists with time  To address this issue  we detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different groups of individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19 disease  group 1 and 2   or potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection  group 3 and 4   and in a representative group of individuals with limited environmental exposure to the virus due to lockdown restrictions  group 5   The primary outcome was specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the different groups assessed by qualitative and quantitative analysis at baseline  3 and 6 months follow-up  The seroconversion rate at baseline test was 95  in group 1  61  in group 2  40  in group 3  17  in group 4 and 3  in group 5  Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed male gender  close COVID-19 contact and presence of COVID-19 related symptoms strongly associated with serological positivity  The percentage of positive individuals as assessed by the qualitative and quantitative tests was superimposable  At the quantitative test  the median level of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels measured in positive cases retested at 6-months increased significantly from baseline  The study indicates that assessing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 through qualitative and quantitative testing is a reliable disease surveillance tool,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969967
9628,INTRODUCTION  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of health promotion in empowering and sustaining communities  as well as the need to build resilient health systems and work collectively with other sectors to protect and promote health  The WHO has mainstreamed health promotion in the Global health agenda  However  the definition and practices of health promotion in Africa are not well understood and documented  with often  an interchangeable use of the concept of health promotion and health prevention  This scoping review is to explore how health promotion is defined and practised in Africa and identify gaps in its implementation within the framework of the Ottawa Charter  METHODS AND ANALYSIS  The scoping review will employ the approach described by Arksey and O Malley in 2005  The approach consists of five stages   1  formulating the research questions   2  identifying relevant studies   3  selecting eligible studies   4  charting the data and  5  collating  summarising and reporting the results  This protocol employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols  PRISMA-P   The review will apply the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to present the results  The scoping review will adapt the five principles set forth in the Ottawa Charter to categorise the outcomes and uses its strategies to define the interventions  Data bases searched are Ovid Medline  Embase  Cochrane Library  CINAHL  SCOPUS  CABI  JBI Evidence Synthesis and grey literature  The database last searched was January 2021  ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION  This review does not require ethics approval  Our dissemination strategy includes peer review publication  policy brief  presentation at conferences and relevant stakeholders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857559
416,BACKGROUND  The incidence of Pneumocystis pneumonia  PCP  among patients without human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  infection continues to increase  Here  we identified potential risk factors for in-hospital mortality among HIV-negative patients with PCP admitted to the intensive care unit  ICU   METHODS  We retrospectively analyzed medical records of 154 non-HIV-infected PCP patients admitted to the ICU at Peking Union Medical College Hospital  PUMCH  and China-Japan Friendship Hospital  CJFH  from October 2012 to July 2020  Clinical characteristics were examined  and factors related to in-hospital mortality were analyzed  RESULTS  A total of 154 patients were enrolled in our study  Overall  the in-hospital mortality rate was 65 6   The univariate analysis indicated that nonsurvivors were older  58 vs  52 years  P   0 021   were more likely to use high-dose steroids  >  1 mg kg day prednisone equivalent  39 62  vs  55 34   P   0 047   receive caspofungin during hospitalization  44 6  vs  28 3   P   0 049   require invasive ventilation  83 2  vs  47 2   P < 0 001   develop shock during hospitalization  61 4  vs  20 8   P < 0 001   and develop pneumomediastinum  21 8  vs  47 2   P   0 001  and had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation  APACHE  II scores on ICU admission  20 32 vs  17 39  P   0 003   lower lymphocyte counts  430 vs  570 cells mul  P   0 014   and lower PaO2 FiO2 values  mmHg  on admission  108 vs  147  P   0 001   Multivariate analysis showed that age  odds ratio  OR  1 03  95  confidence interval  CI  1 00-1 06  P   0 024   use of high-dose steroids  >  1 mg kg day prednisone equivalent  during hospitalization  OR 2 29  95  CI 1 07-4 90  P   0 034   and a low oxygenation index on admission  OR 0 99  95  CI 0 99-1 00  P   0 014  were associated with in-hospital mortality  CONCLUSIONS  The mortality rate of non-HIV-infected patients with PCP was high  and predictive factors of a poor prognosis were advanced age  use of high-dose steroids  >  1 mg kg day prednisone equivalent  during hospitalization  and a low oxygenation index on admission  The use of caspofungin during hospitalization might have no contribution to the prognosis of non-HIV-infected patients with PCP in the ICU,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001555
4344,Background  The rapid scale up of telemedicine due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have disadvantaged patients less able to use technology  Objectives  We tested the hypothesis that certain patient groups may have been disadvantaged in accessing primary care using telemedicine  Design  We compared visit type and patient characteristics for April-May 2019 with April-May 2020 at a large urban academic medical center  Variables of interest included age  gender  race  ethnicity  language  visit type  visit status  insurance type  and zip code to approximate average income  Results  There was a 5  increase in patient visits in the observation period from 2019 to 2020  Care shifted from 100  in person to 83  telemedicine  60  of which occurred through video and 23  by telephone  In 2020  there was a significant increase in the percentage of older patients  patients of lower income  patients whose preferred language was not English  and patients without commercial insurance who accessed care  For patients who completed a telemedicine visit  racial minority status  Hispanic Latino ethnicity  older age  and non-English language preference significantly increased the likelihood of a telephone visit compared with younger adult  white  non-Hispanic Latino and English-preference patients  Conclusions  The increase in visits in 2020 and particularly visits by older  non-English preference and lower income patients  demonstrates that the telemedicine scale-up increased access and reached patients regardless of age  language  and income  However  varied usage of televideo and telephone visits for certain groups suggests the need to explore the differences between these modalities to ensure quality telemedicine care for all patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935517

7251,OBJECTIVE  To determine the differences in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients based on sex and disease severity  METHODS  We used an analytical framework of 382 transcriptional modules and multi-omics analyses to discriminate COVID-19 patients based on sex and disease severity  RESULTS  Male and female patients overexpressed modules related to the innate immune response  The expression of modules related to the adaptive immune response showed lower enrichment levels in males than females  Inflammation modules showed ascending overexpression in male and female patients  while a higher level was observed in severe female patients  Moderate female patients demonstrated significant overexpression to interferon  cytolytic lymphocyte  T   B cells  and erythrocytes modules  Moderate female patients showed a higher adaptive immune response than males matched group  Pathways involved in metabolism dysregulation and Hippo signaling were upregulated in females than in male patients  Females and moderate cases showed higher levels of metabolic dysregulation  CONCLUSIONS  The immune landscape in COVID-19 patients was noticeably different between the sexes  and these differences may highlight disease vulnerability in males  This study suggested that certain treatments that increase or decrease the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might be necessary for male and female patients at certain disease stages,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896122
2855,In the response to the coronavirus pandemic  much attention has been invested in promoting COVID-19 vaccination  However  the impact of seasonal influenza should not be neglected  particularly during the winter influenza surge  Currently  most influenza vaccination campaigns target at healthcare workers or high-risk population groups  while COVID-19 vaccination programmes are targeting the whole population as a single homogeneous group  There is limited research on the promotion of influenza vaccination for university students who study  live  and socialise in close contact with a large variety of people on campus  resulting in a low vaccination rate among this underserved group  Thus  a vaccination programme tailored for university students should be developed to increase protection against influenza-like illnesses and complications  and to help achieve herd immunity across populations who spread viruses  WHO has advocated the potential value of social marketing in vaccination campaigns and highlighted the need for audience segmentation as a major prerequisite component of intervention design  This study aims to identify distinct and homogeneous groups of university students based on sociodemographic  psychographic  and behavioural attributes to inform interventions  Two-step cluster analysis was applied in a sample size of 530 university students and revealed four segments that demonstrate statistically significant differences in their attitudes  behaviours  intentions  and responses to promotion messages about seasonal influenza and COVID-19 vaccination  The findings provide a detailed understanding of segment characteristics among university students that can be applied to develop an effective social marketing campaign that can motivate influenza vaccination and cross-promote uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960143
6843,Objectives Surgical instrumentation teaching is included as an essential part of surgical training in the core surgical training syllabus  Access to formal teaching is variable  and opportunities for informal teaching have been further reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic  We aimed to design a course to fulfil these local trainees  needs  A move away from face-to-face teaching has occurred successfully during the pandemic  but little literature exists on how face-to-face courses can be best designed during this time  We aimed to describe the practicalities of running a face-to-face course with COVID restrictions  Methods Junior doctors and nurses rotated around five stations led by theatre nurses and senior doctors  each with common instruments from different surgical subspecialties  Social distancing was observed  and level 2 personal protective equipment  PPE  was worn throughout the course  Matched pre- and post-course tests allowed evaluation of learning  Results The course had 20 attendees  and the test scores improved following the course by an average of 9   p   0 009   All attendees  100   found the course improved their knowledge and confidence  Feedback was overwhelmingly positive  and the significant improvement in the multiple-choice question  MCQ  scores demonstrates that this was an effective method of delivering teaching despite the COVID-19 restrictions on social distancing  Conclusion This course shows that instrumentation training is valuable to trainees and provides a good example to other educators  showing the workings of how a practical course may be run face-to-face during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900461
5009,Background  Vaccination against COVID-19 remains as a main root of COVID-19 prevention  Few vaccines have been launched for this purpose recently with different side effects  Thrombotic events have been reported as a rare side effect after ChAdox1nCOV-19 vaccination that may cause death of recipient  Case presentation  We report a case of hepatic artery occlusion after the first dose vaccination by ChAdOx1nCov-19  The patient was a health care worker  aged 34-year old  Past medical history was unremarkable and had not used heparin  Over the next couple of days after the vaccination  he reported headache  nausea  and dizziness as well as abdominal pain  His general status and the laboratories studies deteriorate quickly by increasing liver enzymes and severe coagulopathy  Clinically he had presented acute hepatic failure  He had been received blood products  prednisolone pulse along with broad antibiotics without benefit  He died on the sixth day  Conclusions  Thrombotic events after vaccination is very rare but can develop in main arteries with lethal outcome  This event may mimic autoimmune thrombosis clinically,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926142
7652,The analysis regards the simulation of conversion of the durum wheat cultivation into hazelnut  This research is based on a case study in the province of Viterbo  Italy   where the durum wheat production and the hazelnuts represent the primary cultures adopted in this area  The purpose of this study is to analyse the number of people employed in the production of hazelnuts and durum wheat to understand if the intensification of hazelnut production has a positive impact on social sustainability and if the conversion process from durum wheat to hazelnuts is socially sustainable  in order to fill a gap in the existing literature  The social impact analysis shows that the hypothesis would be positive for the agricultural occupation of the Municipalities of the Province of Viterbo considered  The results showed as the conversion from the cultivation of durum wheat in hazelnut has brought to a considerable increase in agricultural occupation  Finally  I analysed the effects of the pandemic s crisis on the COVID-19 virus in the choices related to the conversion between durum wheat and hazelnuts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888567
6393,Novel coronavirus disease  a serious challenge for the healthcare system  has diverted all the researchers toward the exploration of potential targets  compounds or vaccines for the management of this disease  M pro  enzyme was found to be crucial for replication of this virus which makes this enzyme an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-2  Diverse pharmacological profile of Alkannin shikonin  A S  derivatives build up curiosity to study their antiviral profile  Therefore  current study utilises various computational tools to screen and evaluate all the discovered A S derivatives to inhibit the M pro  enzyme for its anti-viral activity  Results revealed that the A S has a very good tendency to inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme  Moreover   5 R 6R -5 8-dihydroxy-6-methoxy-3 4 5 6-tetrahydro-2H-benzo a anthracene-1  7  12-trione  an A S derivative was found to possess drug-likeliness properties and a good ADME profile  Moreover  its complex with Mpro enzyme was found stable for 50 ns which makes it a very promising ligand to treat COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906016
3338,BACKGROUND  India has been severely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  However  due to shortcomings in disease surveillance  the burden of mortality associated with COVID-19 remains poorly understood  We aimed to assess changes in mortality during the pandemic in Chennai  Tamil Nadu  using data on all-cause mortality within the district  METHODS  For this observational study  we analysed comprehensive death registrations in Chennai  from Jan 1  2016  to June 30  2021  We estimated expected mortality without the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by fitting models to observed mortality time series during the pre-pandemic period  with stratification by age and sex  Additionally  we considered three periods of interest  the first 4 weeks of India s first lockdown  March 24 to April 20  2020   the 4-month period including the first wave of the pandemic in Chennai  May 1 to Aug 31  2020   and the 4-month period including the second wave of the pandemic in Chennai  March 1 to June 30  2021   We computed the difference between observed and expected mortality from March 1  2020  to June 30  2021  and compared pandemic-associated mortality across socioeconomically distinct communities  measured with use of 2011 census of India data  with regression analyses  FINDINGS  Between March 1  2020  and June 30  2021  87 870 deaths were registered in areas of Chennai district represented by the 2011 census  exceeding expected deaths by 25 990  95  uncertainty interval 25 640-26 360  or 5 18  5 11-5 25  excess deaths per 1000 people  Stratified by age  excess deaths numbered 21 02  20 54-21 49  excess deaths per 1000 people for individuals aged 60-69 years  39 74  38 73-40 69  for those aged 70-79 years  and 96 90  93 35-100 16  for those aged 80 years or older  Neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status had 0 7  to 2 8  increases in pandemic-associated mortality per 1 SD increase in each measure of community disadvantage  due largely to a disproportionate increase in mortality within these neighbourhoods during the second wave  Conversely  differences in excess mortality across communities were not clearly associated with socioeconomic status measures during the first wave  For each increase by 1 SD in measures of community disadvantage  neighbourhoods had 3 6  to 8 6  lower pandemic-associated mortality during the first 4 weeks of India s country-wide lockdown  before widespread SARS-CoV-2 circulation was underway in Chennai  The greatest reductions in mortality during this early lockdown period were observed among men aged 20-29 years  with 58   54-62  fewer deaths than expected from pre-pandemic trends  INTERPRETATION  Mortality in Chennai increased substantially but heterogeneously during the COVID-19 pandemic  with the greatest burden concentrated in disadvantaged communities  Reported COVID-19 deaths greatly underestimated pandemic-associated mortality  FUNDING  National Institute of General Medical Sciences  Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  National Science Foundation  TRANSLATION  For the Hindi translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953536
3761,Healthy and controlled immune response in COVID-19 is crucial for mild forms of the disease  Although CD8  T cells play important role in this response  there is still a lack of studies showing the gene expression profiles in those cells at the beginning of the disease as potential predictors of more severe forms after the first week  We investigated a proportion of different subpopulations of CD8  T cells and their gene expression patterns for cytotoxic proteins  perforin-1  PRF1   granulysin  GNLY   granzyme B  GZMB   granzyme A  GZMA   granzyme K  GZMK    cytokine interferon-gamma  IFN-gamma   and apoptotic protein Fas ligand  FASL  in CD8  T cells from peripheral blood in first weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection  Sixteen COVID-19 patients and nine healthy controls were included  The absolute counts of total lymphocytes  p   0 007   CD3   p   0 05   and CD8  T cells  p   0 01  in COVID-19 patients were significantly decreased compared to healthy controls  In COVID-19 patients in CD8  T cell compartment  we observed lower frequency effector memory 1  EM1   p   0 06  and effector memory 4  EM4   p < 0 001  CD8  T cells  Higher mRNA expression of PRF1  p   0 05  and lower mRNA expression of FASL  p   0 05  at the fifth day of the disease were found in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls  mRNA expression of PRF1  p < 0 001  and IFN-gamma  p < 0 001  was significantly downregulated in the first week of disease in COVID-19 patients who progressed to moderate and severe forms after the first week  compared to patients with mild symptoms during the entire disease course  GZMK  p < 0 01  and FASL  p < 0 01  mRNA expression was downregulated in all COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls  Our results can lead to a better understanding of the inappropriate immune response of CD8  T cells in SARS-CoV2 with the faster progression of the disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945761
6079,Objectives  The present study aimed to assess the 4- and 8-week recovery rate of anosmia and determine the factors associated with recovery in COVID-19 patients  Method  This retrospective study was conducted from December 2020 to March 2021  RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 adult patients  over 18 years of age  with a positive history of anosmia were included in this study  Anosmia was assessed based on the COVID-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool  The recovery rate of anosmia after 4 and 8 weeks were evaluated  and the relationship between the patients  recovery and their clinical and demographic data was assessed  Results  A total of 235 patients were included  Their mean age    -SD  was 43 95   - 15 27 years  Anosmia recovery was reported in 207 88 51   and 219  93 19   participants till 4 and 8 weeks  The mean recovery time was 19 42   - 8 81 days  The result of logistic regression showed that smoking  P    031  OR   10 813   ageusia  P    002  OR   5 340   headache  P    006  OR   0 243   and nasal discharge  P <  001  OR   0 080  were significantly associated with 4 weeks anosmia recovery  The only risk factor which was associated with a lower rate of 8 weeks anosmia recovery was presence of nasal discharge  OR   0 106  P    002   Conclusion  The only risk factor which was associated with a lower rate of 8 weeks anosmia recovery was presence of nasal discharge  Our result demonstrated that although smoking was associated with higher recovery rate till 4 weeks  it could not be considered as a protective factor after 8 weeks  More studies are recommended to investigate the relationship between anosmia and the associated factors by consideration of both short- and long-term recovery rates and assess the possible mechanisms that could justify this association  Levels of Evidence  3b,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909467
8626,INTRODUCTION  Health disparities among racial and ethnic and socioeconomic groups are pervasive  and the COVID-19 pandemic has not been an exception  This study explores the key demographic and socioeconomic factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 vaccination coverage  METHODS  Using recent  January 2021-March 2021  data on adults from the U S  Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey  a regression-based decomposition method was used to estimate how much of the observed racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage could be explained by particular socioeconomic and demographic factors  i e   age  number of children and adults in household   RESULTS  Demographics  socioeconomic factors  and experiencing economic hardship during the pandemic each explained a statistically significant portion of vaccination coverage disparities between non-Hispanic White and racial ethnic minority individuals  The largest disparity was observed among people who identified as Hispanic or Latino  whose vaccination coverage was 8 0  95  CI 7 1  8 9  percentage points lower than that of their non-Hispanic White counterparts  Socioeconomic factors explained 4 8  95  CI 4 3  5 2  percentage points of this disparity  and economic hardship explained an additional 1 4  95  CI 1 2  1 6  percentage points  CONCLUSIONS  This paper identified the key factors related to racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination coverage  The variables that explained the largest portions of the disparities were age  education  employment  and income  The study findings can help to inform efforts to increase equitable vaccine access and engage various segments of the population to prevent the further exacerbation of COVID-19 health disparities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872772

5427,BACKGROUND  Gauteng province  with 26 3  of South Africa s population  is the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the country  During the first epidemic wave in 2020  Gauteng accounted for 32 0  of South Africa s reported COVID-19 cases  AIM  The aim of this study was to describe the health system response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first epidemic wave in Gauteng province and to explore the perspectives of key informants on the provincial response  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Using an adapted Pandemic Emergency Response Conceptual Framework  this was a qualitative case study design consisting of 36 key informant interviews and a document analysis  We used thematic analysis to identify themes and sub-themes from the qualitative data  RESULTS  Our case study found that Gauteng developed an innovative  multi-sectoral and comprehensive provincial COVID-19 response that aimed to address the dual challenge of saving lives and the economy  However  the interviews revealed multiple perspectives  experiences  contestations and contradictions in the pandemic response  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and amplified the fragilities of existing systems  reflected in the corruption on personal protective equipment  poor data quality and inappropriate decisions on self-standing field hospitals  Rooted in a chronic under-investment and insufficient focus on the health workforce  the response failed to take into account or deal with their fears  and to incorporate strategies for psychosocial support  and safe working environments  The single-minded focus on COVID-19 exacerbated these fragilities  resulting in a de facto health system lockdown and reported collateral damage  The key informants identified missed opportunities to invest in primary health care  partner with communities and to include the private health sector in the pandemic response  CONCLUSION  Gauteng province should build on the innovations of the multi-sectoral response to the COVID-19 pandemic  while addressing the contested areas and health system fragilities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919565
198,Background As of October 2021  sports activities require preventive measures against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  infection  Judo  a close-contact sport  demands careful prevention with great consideration to the risk of infection  The All Japan Judo Federation Medical Science Committee  AJJF  designed COVID-19 prevention protocols from a medical perspective and developed policies for safe regular practices and tournaments  Objective and Methods We aim to examine the efficacy of health surveys and polymerase chain reaction  PCR  tests prior to judo tournaments  as mandated by the tournament policy  Infection prevention managers were installed prior to tournaments  Two weeks prior to each tournament  these managers drafted health inventory forms for athletes and related parties to check for COVID-19-associated symptoms  Although PCR testing prior to tournaments was not required by policy  the AJJF conducted them  directly and by mail  prior to six tournaments from October 2020 to September 2021 for athletes whose health inventory forms listed no symptoms  Results One of the athletes was not tested and was unable to participate in a tournament due to the symptoms indicated in their health inventory form  Testing began in October 2020 and was conducted until September 2021 for 2 073 athletes over the duration of six tournaments  The SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in 11  0 29   athletes  In tournaments held until April 2021  SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only one of the 1 173  0 08   athletes tested  However  prior to tournaments held from July 2021 onward  when variants became prevalent  SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10  1 1   of the 900 athletes tested  p < 0 05   No clusters were reported in association with any tournament  Conclusion We believe that drafting health inventory forms two weeks prior to judo tournaments was essential and kept the participants alert  However  as variants emerged  some participants who were positive could not be detected through their inventory forms  this demonstrates the need for caution when relying on health inventory forms alone,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004075

7450,SARS-CoV-2 has emerged to cause the outbreak of COVID-19  which has expanded into a worldwide human pandemic  Although detailed experimental data on animal experiments would provide insight into drug efficacy  the scientists involved in these experiments would be exposed to severe risks  In this context  we propose a computational framework for studying infection dynamics that can be used to capture the growth rate of viral replication and lung epithelial cell in presence of SARS-CoV-2  Specifically  we formulate the model consisting of a system of non-linear ODEs that can be used for visualizing the infection dynamics in a cell population considering the role of T cells and Macrophages  The major contribution of the proposed simulation method is to utilize the infection progression model in testing the efficacy of the drugs having various mechanisms and analyzing the effect of time of drug administration on virus clearance Clinical Relevance-The proposed computational framework incorporates viral infection dynamics and role of immune response in Covid-19 that can be used to test the impact of drug efficacy and time of drug administration on infection mitigation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892188
6923,Self-determination theory assumes that the basic psychological needs for autonomy  competence  and relatedness are associated with motivational regulation  As these basic psychological needs may have been affected by the shift to distance learning  students  motivational regulation and vitality may have suffered as well  The purpose of this study was to examine the motivational regulation  satisfaction  or frustration of the basic psychological needs and vitality of university students before and after the transition to forced distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic  Two student samples from Austria and Germany were studied  One was surveyed before the conversion to distance learning  N 1 139  and the other at the beginning of forced distance learning  N 1 835   The instruments used were the Scales for the Measurement of Motivational Regulation for Learning in University Students  SMR-L   the German version of the Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Frustration Scale  a scale developed by the authors to differentiate the assessment of social relatedness  and the German version of the Subjective Vitality Scale  The results show that the satisfaction of basic psychological needs was significantly lower and the frustration thereof substantially higher during the distance learning period than before the pandemic  Intrinsic motivation and identified regulation were significantly lower during the forced distance learning period  and more controlled forms of motivation were higher than before the pandemic  Structural equation models showed that 42  of the students  vitality can be explained by motivational regulation and the satisfaction and frustration of their basic needs  Motivational regulation styles functioned  differentiated according to the degree of autonomy  as mediating variables between basic needs and vitality  In terms of theoretical implications  the distinction between approach and avoidance components of introjected regulation was shown to be adequate and necessary  as they explain the outcome vitality differently  The support and avoidance of frustration of basic psychological needs should be considered in distance learning to promote the quality of motivation and students  vitality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899527
5333,The transmission of COVID-19 is dependent on social mixing  the basic rate of which varies with sociodemographic  cultural  and geographic factors  Alterations in social mixing and subsequent changes in transmission dynamics eventually affect hospital admissions  We employ these observations to model and predict regional hospital admissions in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic  We use an SEIR-model for each region in Sweden in which the social mixing is assumed to depend on mobility data from public transport utilisation and locations for mobile phone usage  The results show that the model could capture the timing of the first and beginning of the second wave of the pandemic 3 weeks in advance without any additional assumptions about seasonality  Further  we show that for two major regions of Sweden  models with public transport data outperform models using mobile phone usage  We conclude that a model based on routinely collected mobility data makes it possible to predict future hospital admissions for COVID-19 3 weeks in advance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921175
4245,Background  Due to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic  learning institutions were faced with many challenges while transitioning their in-person courses to an online format for teaching  learning  and testing  One of these challenges included the continuation of assessments in a safe but secure manner  Discussion  Professional health programs may need to implement new policies to ensure a fair  safe testing process that maintains exam integrity during remote assessments  We concluded that transitioning to remote assessments for health professional schools posed many challenges  Further studies may elaborate the effectiveness and limitations of the various approaches used for remote assessments by professional health programs during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937302
3101,INTRODUCTION  There is a paucity of studies examining the prevalence and clinical characteristics of rhabdomyolysis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection  The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence  clinical characteristics  and outcome of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection who develop rhabdomyolysis  METHODOLOGY  This is a single-center retrospective analysis of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 8  2020  and January 11  2021  All patients with creatinine kinase  CK  levels available during the hospital admission were included  Rhabdomyolysis was defined as an elevation in CK level higher than five times the upper limit of normal  i e   1125 U L   We compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who developed rhabdomyolysis with patients who did not develop rhabdomyolysis  RESULTS  The incidence of rhabdomyolysis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection was 9 2   There was no significant difference noted in comorbidities and clinical characteristics between the two groups  Moreover  there was no significant difference noted in the presence of severe COVID-19 infection  72 7  vs 54 6   p   0 1   mortality  27 3  vs 23 9   p   0 72   acute kidney injury  59 1  vs 42 7   p   0 14   or need for intensive care unit  ICU  care  72 7  vs 51 4   p   0 051   However  a higher percentage of patients in the rhabdomyolysis group required physical rehabilitation after discharge  40 9  vs 19 3   p   0 02   CONCLUSION  The overall incidence of rhabdomyolysis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection was high  9 2    The presence of rhabdomyolysis was not associated with the increased severity of the disease  Patients with rhabdomyolysis more frequently required physical rehabilitation compared to those without rhabdomyolysis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956789

3295,SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has claimed millions of lives since its first identification in December 2019  Patients with diabetes are at a high risk of adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection  whereas infection itself can be associated with severe hyperglycemia  including hyperglycemic emergencies  While the accelerated vaccine development and rollout have considerably decreased morbidity and mortality with reasonable safety  there are emerging reports of worsening of hyperglycemia in response to vaccination  with possible shared pathophysiology with COVID-19 infection-related hyperglycemia  We hereby report two young patients with type 1 diabetes  T1DM  who presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis  DKA  after receiving second doses of COVISHIELD  ChAdOx1 nCoV-19  and COVAXIN  BBV152- inactivated whole virion  vaccines  Though a causal link cannot be established  post-vaccination immune response can potentially explain this transient worsening of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemic emergencies  We  hence report diabetic ketoacidosis  DKA  following COVID-19 vaccination in T1DM  We suggest that people with diabetes  particularly patients with T1DM with inadequate glycemic control should ideally be closely monitored for hyperglycemia and ketonemia for at least 2 weeks after receiving vaccination for COVID 19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954484
1215,BACKGROUND  The global pandemic of novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  has led to global shortages of ventilators and accessories  One solution to this problem is to split ventilators between multiple patients  which poses the difficulty of treating two patients with dissimilar ventilation needs  A proposed solution to this problem is the use of 3D-printed flow splitters and restrictors  There is little data available on the reliability of such devices and how the use of different 3D printing methods might affect their performance  METHODS  We performed flow resistance measurements on 30 different 3D-printed restrictor designs produced using a range of fused deposition modelling and stereolithography printers and materials  from consumer grade printers using polylactic acid filament to professional printers using surgical resin  We compared their performance to novel computational fluid dynamics models driven by empirical ventilator flow rate data  This indicates the ideal performance of a part that matches the computer model  RESULTS  The 3D-printed restrictors varied considerably between printers and materials to a sufficient degree that would make them unsafe for clinical use without individual testing  This occurs because the interior surface of the restrictor is rough and has a reduced nominal average diameter when compared to the computer model  However  we have also shown that with careful calibration it is possible to tune the end-inspiratory  tidal  volume by titrating the inspiratory time on the ventilator  CONCLUSIONS  Computer simulations of differential multi patient ventilation indicate that the use of 3D-printed flow splitters is viable  However  in situ testing indicates that using 3D printers to produce flow restricting orifices is not recommended  as the flow resistance can deviate significantly from expected values depending on the type of printer used  TRIAL REGISTRATION  Not applicable,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985624
7181,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the course of coronavirus-19  COVID-19  infection in paediatric familial Mediterranean fever  FMF  patients and to investigate the risk factors for COVID-19 infection  METHODS  Medical records of 100 consecutive paediatric FMF patients and their COVID-19 infection status were evaluated  Age- and gender-matched control group consisted of 51 patients with positive results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  RESULTS  Twenty-five of 100 paediatric FMF patients were detected to have COVID-19 infection  A history of contact with a COVID-19 case was present in approximately 95  of patients in both the FMF and control groups with COVID-19 infection  Asymptomatic infection was detected in two patients in the paediatric FMF group  8 0   and 17 patients in the control group  33 3    P    017   Mild disease was observed in 23 paediatric FMF patients  92 0   and 28 control patients  54 9    P    001   whereas moderate disease was present in only 6 control patients  11 7    0 vs 11 7   P    074   Severe or critical disease was not observed in any patients  CONCLUSION  Paediatric FMF patients receiving colchicine had no moderate COVID-19 disease compared to the control group  We suggest that colchicine use may tune down the severity of the disease even if it does not prevent COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897503

2474,Importance  The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of alternative care modalities  eg  teleconsultations and task shifting  that will continue to be implemented in parallel to traditional care after the pandemic  An ideal balance between alternative and traditional care modalities is unknown  Objectives  To quantify the ideal postpandemic balance between alternative and traditional care modalities among patients with chronic illness and to qualify the circumstances in which patients consider it appropriate to replace traditional care with alternative care  Design  Setting  and Participants  This survey study invited 5999 adults with chronic illness in ComPaRe  a French nationwide e-cohort of adults with chronic conditions who volunteer their time to participate in research projects  to participate in this study  which was performed from January 27 to February 23  2021  Main Outcomes and Measures  Participants rated the ideal proportion at which they would use 3 alternative care modalities instead of the traditional care equivalent on a 0  to 100  scale  with 0  indicating using alternative care modalities for none of one s future care and 100  indicating using alternative care modalities for all of one s future care  of their overall future care   1  teleconsultations   2  online symptom-checkers to react to new symptoms  and  3  remote monitoring to adapt treatment outside consultations  The median ideal proportion of alternative care use was calculated  Perceived appropriate circumstances in which each alternative modality could replace traditional care were collected with open-ended questions  Analyses were performed on a weighted data set representative of patients with chronic illness in France  Results  Of the 5999 invited individuals  1529  mean  SD  age  50 3  14 7  years  1072  70 1   female  agreed to participate  participation rate  25 5    Participants would choose teleconsultations for 50 0  of their future consultations  IQR  11 0 -52 0    online symptom-checkers over contacting their physician for 22 0  of new symptoms  IQR  2 0 -50 0    and remote monitoring instead of consultations for 52 3  of their treatment adaptations  IQR  25 4 -85 4    Participants reported 67 circumstances for which replacing traditional with alternative care modalities was considered appropriate  including 31 care activities  eg  prescription renewal and addressing acute or minor complaints   25 patient characteristics  eg  stable chronic condition and established patient-physician relationship   and 11 required characteristics of the alternative care modalities  eg  quality assurance   Conclusions and Relevance  Results of this survey study suggest that after the pandemic  patients would choose alternative over traditional care for 22  to 52  of the time across different care needs  Participants proposed 67 criteria to guide clinicians in replacing traditional care with alternative care  These findings provide a guide for redesigning care in collaboration with patients after the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964850
7143,OBJECTIVE  To determine whether high-dose dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days  VFD  among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  caused by COVID-19  DESIGN  Multicenter  randomized  open-label  clinical trial  PARTICIPANTS  Consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19-related ARDS were enrolled from June 17  2020  to March 27  2021  in four intensive care units  ICUs  in Argentina  INTERVENTION  16 mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for five days followed by 8 mg of dexamethasone daily for five days or 6 mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 10 days  MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES  The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days  The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 and 90 days  infection rate  muscle weakness  and glycemic control in the first 28 days  RESULTS  Data from 98 patients who received at least one dose of dexamethasone were analyzed  The trial was prematurely terminated due to low enrollment rate  At 28 days after randomization  there was no difference between high- and low-dose dexamethasone groups in VFD  median  0  interquartile range  IQR  0-14  vs  0  IQR 0-1  days  P    231   or in the mean duration of mechanical ventilation  19   - 18 vs  25   - 22 days  P    078   The cumulative hazard of successful discontinuation from mechanical ventilation was increased by the high-dose treatment  adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio  1 84  95  CI  1 31 to 2 5  P <  001   None of the prespecified secondary and safety outcomes showed a significant difference between treatment arms  CONCLUSIONS  Among patients with ARDS due to COVID-19  the use of higher doses of dexamethasone compared with the recommended low-dose treatment did not show an increase in VFD  However  the higher dose significantly improved the time required to liberate them from the ventilator,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898320
1487,Extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin  exosomes  mediate intercellular communication by transporting substrates with a variety of functions related to tissue homeostasis and disease  Their diagnostic and therapeutic potential has been recognized for diseases such as cancer in which signaling defects are prominent  However  it is unclear to what extent exosomes and their cargo inform the progression of infectious diseases  We recently defined a subset of exosomes termed defensosomes that are mobilized during bacterial infection in a manner dependent on autophagy proteins  Through incorporating protein receptors on their surface  defensosomes mediated host defense by binding and inhibiting pore-forming toxins secreted by bacterial pathogens  Given this capacity to serve as decoys that interfere with surface protein interactions  we investigated the role of defensosomes during infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   the etiological agent of COVID-19  Consistent with a protective function  exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor ACE2 in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid from critically ill COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced ICU and hospitalization times  We found ACE2  exosomes were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture  which required the autophagy protein ATG16L1  defining these as defensosomes  We further demonstrate that ACE2  defensosomes directly bind and block viral entry  These findings suggest that defensosomes may contribute to the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 and expand our knowledge on the regulation and effects of extracellular vesicles during infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981050
7457,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has become a global pandemic  The segmentation of COVID-19 pneumonia lesions from CT images is important in quantitative evaluation and assessment of the infection  Though many deep learning segmentation methods have been proposed  the performance is limited when pixel-level annotations are hard to obtain  In order to alleviate the performance limitation brought by the lack of pixel-level annotation in COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation task  we construct a denoising self-supervised framework  which is composed of a pretext denoising task and a downstream segmentation task  Through the pretext denoising task  the semantic features from massive unlabelled data are learned in an unsupervised manner  so as to provide additional supervisory signal for the downstream segmentation task  Experimental results showed that our method can effectively leverage unlabelled images to improve the segmentation performance  and outperformed reconstruction-based self-supervised learning when only a small set of training images are annotated Clinical relevance-The proposed method can effectively leverage unlabelled images to improve the performance for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation when only a small set of CT images are annotated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892041
3485,As in past pandemics  co-circulating pathogens may play a role in the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   In particular  experimental evidence indicates that influenza infection can up-regulate the expression of ACE2-the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells-and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection  Here we hypothesized that influenza impacted the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early 2020 epidemic of COVID-19 in Europe  To test this hypothesis  we developed a population-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and of COVID-19 mortality  which simultaneously incorporated the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures and of influenza on the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2  Using statistical inference methods based on iterated filtering  we confronted this model with mortality incidence data in four European countries  Belgium  Italy  Norway  and Spain  to systematically test a range of assumptions about the impact of influenza  We found consistent evidence for a 1 8-3 4-fold  uncertainty range across countries  1 1 to 5 0  average population-level increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with influenza during the period of co-circulation  These estimates remained robust to a variety of alternative assumptions regarding the epidemiological traits of SARS-CoV-2 and the modeled impact of control measures  Although further confirmatory evidence is required  our results suggest that influenza could facilitate the spread and hamper effective control of SARS-CoV-2  More generally  they highlight the possible role of co-circulating pathogens in the epidemiology of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950537
1092,While COVID-19 pandemic has become an enormous and devastating pandemic for today s world  studies on the morbidity of the disease mainly show the disease s progress with pneumonia and thromboembolic pathologies  In this disease with a predisposition to thromboembolism  findings of nontraumatic focused hemorrhages are unexpected  As spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma is a serious condition with the absence of symptoms  creating a challenge for diagnosis  it should also be considered in COVID-19 which is thought to be predisposed to thromboembolism  Here  a 47-year-old woman with COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis  diagnosed by computed tomography  CT  scan and approved by nasopharyngeal swab test  is presented with spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma  and its management is reported  This case highlights the importance of considering both thromboembolic events and bleeding in cases with COVID-19 positivity  The balance between two sides of clotting mechanisms needs to be understood with novel research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987821
4801,PURPOSE  Describe the differences in characteristics and outcomes between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia patients admitted to Dutch ICUs  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Data from the National-Intensive-Care-Evaluation-registry of COVID-19 patients admitted between February 15th and January 1th 2021 and other viral pneumonia patients admitted between January 1st 2017 and January 1st 2020 were used  Patients  characteristics  the unadjusted  and adjusted in-hospital mortality were compared  RESULTS  6343 COVID-19 and 2256 other viral pneumonia patients from 79 ICUs were included  The COVID-19 patients included more male  71 3 vs 49 8    had a higher Body-Mass-Index  28 1 vs 25 5   less comorbidities  42 2 vs 72 7    and a prolonged hospital length of stay  19 vs 9 days   The COVID-19 patients had a significantly higher crude in-hospital mortality rate  Odds ratio  OR    1 80   after adjustment for patient characteristics and ICU occupancy rate the OR was respectively 3 62 and 3 58  CONCLUSION  Higher mortality among COVID-19 patients could not be explained by patient characteristics and higher ICU occupancy rates  indicating that COVID-19 is more severe compared to other viral pneumonia  Our findings confirm earlier warnings of a high need of ICU capacity and high mortality rates among relatively healthy COVID-19 patients as this may lead to a higher mental workload for the staff,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929530

637,OBJECTIVES  The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospital organisation and healthcare professionals to prepare for large quantities of patients in isolation rooms  In situ simulation may seem promising in order to manage the organisational changes that the pandemic require  This study aims to investigate in situ simulations influence on healthcare professional s self-perceived preparedness to face the pandemic  DESIGN  A qualitative focus group study  SETTING  We conducted full scale in situ simulations over a 3-week period in April 2020  including 277 healthcare professionals  at a Danish University Hospital  Subsequently  six semistructured focus group interviews  including 22 participants from the simulations  were conducted in May 2020  PARTICIPANTS  22 healthcare professionals participated in the focus group interviews  METHODS  The simulations consisted of a briefing  two scenarios focusing on acute respiratory insufficiency and correct use of personal protective equipment  PPE   and a debriefing  We conducted six focus group interviews using comparable semistructured interview guides focusing on the organisational restructuring of the departments and outcomes of the needs-driven simulation-based programme  We used thematic analysis to identify main themes  RESULTS  The informants perceived that the simulations resulted in positive experiences for the healthcare professionals and perceived the organisational changes as effective  They highlighted that simulation enhanced teamwork  demystified the COVID-19 disease  and improved skills  in correct use of PPE and acute treatment of COVID-19 patients  Data revealed that a predefined simulation task force including both experienced simulators and medical experts for facilitation of in situ simulation would be beneficial  CONCLUSION  In situ simulation may be useful to enhance learning on organisation and individual level during a pandemic  This educational activity could serve an important role in facilitating hospital preparation and education of large numbers of healthcare professionals during a healthcare crisis  Introduction of a simulation task force is suggested to handle coordination and rapid enrolment across the hospital,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996802
6453,BACKGROUND  Reports of transmission of COVID-19 from a vaccinated healthcare worker  HCW  to vaccinated co-workers are sparse  METHODS  Index case  IC   After the second dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  a HCW - our IC was diagnosed of COVID-19 by a rapid antigen test  RAT   A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  test done on the same day showed a cycle threshold  Ct  value of 10 02  a very high viral load   Contact tracing and findings  The authors traced IC s contacts and seven contacts were identified  Four of those  P 1-4  were tested positive for COVID-19 on day12 after the contact  P1-2 were vaccinated and had slept near the IC in an enclosed 5 5 x 2 7 x 2 4 m room without air change and without masks  while IC was symptomatic  P3 and P4 came in immediately after IC left that room and slept there without masks  We did not find any other exposures of P1-4 within the 14 days  d  before they tested positive  CONCLUSIONS  P1 and P2 are COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections  P3 and P4 contracting infection in the physical absence of IC indicates probable aerosol transmission of COVID-19  The factors that led to this episode  namely  unfamiliarity of breakthrough COVID-19 infections  ignoring the risk of contracting COVID-19 from vaccinated co-workers  hesitancy in seeking medical care soon after the onset of symptoms  poorly ventilated and cramped resting rooms for HCW exists worldwide  This episode reiterates the importance of adhering to basic COVID-19 preventive measures even after vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904921
3209,In this paper  I consider whether the critical rationalist philosophy of science may provide a rationale for trusting scientific knowledge  In the first part  I refer to several insights of Karl Popper s social and political philosophy in order to see whether they may be of help in offsetting the distrust of science spawned by the COVID-19 pandemic  In the second part  I address the more general issue of whether the theoretical principles of the critical rationalist philosophy of science may afford a foundation for building trust in science  Both parts of the discussion  confined for the sake of the argument largely to the repudiation of the concept of good reasons for considering a theory to be true  imply that this question would have to be answered negatively  Against this  I argue that such a conclusion is based on a misconception of the nature of scientific knowledge  critical rationalism views science as a cognitive regime which calls for bold theories and at the same time demands a rigorous and continuous distrust towards them  and it is precisely this attitude that should be adopted as a compelling argument for trusting science,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955607
9174,BACKGROUND  In December 2019  we ran Pacific Eclipse  a pandemic tabletop exercise using smallpox originating in Fiji as a case study  Pacific Eclipse brought together international stakeholders from health  defence  law enforcement  emergency management and a range of other organisations  AIM  To review potential gaps in preparedness and identify modifiable factors which could prevent a pandemic or mitigate the impact of a pandemic  METHODS  Pacific Eclipse was held on December 9-10 in Washington DC  Phoenix and Honolulu simultaneously  The scenario began in Fiji and becomes a pandemic  Mathematical modelling of smallpox transmission was used to simulate the epidemic under different conditions and to test the effect of interventions  Live polling  using Poll Everywhere software that participants downloaded onto their smart phones  was used to gather participant decisions as the scenario unfolded  Stakeholders from state and federal government and non-government organisations from The United States  The United Kingdom  Australia  New Zealand  Canada  as well as industry and non-government organisations attended  RESULTS  The scenario progressed in three phases and participants were able to make decisions during each phase using live polling  The polling showed very diverse and sometimes conflicting decision making  Factors influential to pandemic severity were identified and categorised as modifiable or unmodifiable  A series of recommendations were made on the modifiable determinants of pandemic severity and how these can be incorporated into pandemic planning  These included preventing an attack through intelligence  law enforcement and legislation  improved speed of diagnosis  speed and completeness of case finding and case isolation  speed and security of vaccination response  including stockpiling   speed and completeness of contact tracing  protecting critical infrastructure and business continuity  non-pharmaceutical interventions  social distancing  PPE  border control  and protecting first responders  DISCUSSION  Pacific Eclipse illustrated the impact of a pandemic of smallpox under different response scenarios  which were validated to some extent by the COVID-19 pandemic  The framework developed from the scenario draws out modifiable determinants of pandemic severity which can inform pandemic planning for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865873
8148,Background  Patients with multiple sclerosis  MS  receiving immunomodulatory drugs were excluded from clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines  Therefore  data regarding the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to induce humoral immunity in MS patients treated with B- and T-cell depleting agents is urgently warranted  Cladribine tablets are a high-efficacy disease-modifying treatment that exerts its therapeutic effect via sustained but transient lymphocyte depletion  Aim  We report humoral responses in a German cohort of MS patients treated with cladribine tablets  Methods  This retrospective analysis included patients >  18 years who were treated with cladribine tablets for relapsing MS in the first or second year and were fully vaccinated against COVID-19  Two weeks after the second vaccination at the earliest  blood samples were obtained for the assessment of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies  lymphocyte counts  B-cells  CD4    T-cells  and CD8    T-cells  Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were quantified with the LIAISON  R   SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay  Positivity was defined at a cutoff value of 33 8 BAU mL  Results  In total  38 patients  73 7  female  aged 23-66 years  were included in the analysis  Ten patients  26 3   were treatment-naive before initiating treatment with cladribine tablets  Most patients  84 2   received mRNA vaccines  The time between the last dose of cladribine tablets and vaccination ranged between 2 and 96 weeks  Six patients  15 8   were vaccinated within 4 weeks of their last cladribine dose  All patients achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels  Humoral immune response was independent of age  time of vaccination in relation to the last cladribine dose  lymphocyte counts as well as B- and T-cell counts  Conclusions  Treatment with cladribine tablets did not impair humoral response to COVID-19 vaccination  Time since last cladribine dose  age  prior therapy  lymphocyte count as well as B- and T-cell counts had no effect on seropositivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880703
1785,Little is known about physical activity  screen time and sleep among Mexican toddlers and preschoolers  The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of childcare education centers and restrictions to spend time outdoors  This study aimed to investigate the correlates of changes in movement behaviors from before to during the early stages of the COVID-19 lockdown in a national sample of toddlers and preschoolers in Mexico  A cross-sectional study was conducted using an open online survey completed by caretakers of children aged 1-5 years from April to July 2020  The questionnaire enquired about the time spent in each movement behavior during a regular week before and during lockdown  and family and household characteristics  Factors associated with changes in movement behaviors were explored using adjusted linear regression models  A total of 631 children  3 3y  95  CI  3 1  3 4  were included in the study  During lockdown  physical activity decreased by 25   screen time doubled  and sleep quality declined in 17   p < 0 001   Toddlers and preschoolers of older age  attending a childcare education center before the lockdown  with a screen in their bedroom  higher access to electronic devices  and lower socioeconomic level experienced greater changes during this period  Those with limits on the use of electronic devices  who had someone available to play with them  and availability of toys experienced less pronounced changes  Pandemic restrictions have impacted movement behaviors of toddlers and preschoolers  with disproportionate effects among lower socioeconomic levels  Interventions with a multi-level equity-oriented approach are urgently needed to mitigate these effects,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976621

4680,Due to the necessity to control human-to-human spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   the overwhelming majority of the generated data on this virus was solely related to the genomic characteristics of strains infecting humans  conversely  this work aimed to recover and analyze the diversity of viral genomes from non-human sources  From a set of 3595 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences  128 lineages were identified in non-human hosts  the majority represented by the variants of concern Delta  n   1105  30 7   and Alpha  n   466  12 9    followed by B 1 1 298 lineage  n   458  12 7    Environment  Neovison vison  Odocoileus virginianus and Felis catus were the non-human sources with the highest number of lineages  14  12 and 10  respectively   Phylogenomic analyses showed viral clusters from environmental sources  N  vison  O  virginianus  Panthera tigris  and Panthera leo  These clusters were collectively related to human viruses as well as all other non-human sources that were heterogeneously distributed in the phylogenetic tree  Further  the genetic details of viral genomes from bats and pangolins were independently investigated owing to their high divergence  revealing five distinct clusters  Cluster 4 exclusively included bat-sourced genomes and the SARS-CoV-2 reference strain Wuhan-01  In summary  this study identified new genetic landmarks of SARS-CoV-2 evolution  We propose potential interspecies transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 between animals and humans  which should be considered in order to establish better pathogen surveillance and containment strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931174
6902,Objective  The coronavirus pandemic has significantly disrupted the way we deliver healthcare worldwide  We have been flexible and creative in order to continue providing elective colorectal cancer operations and to restart services for benign cases during the recovery period of the pandemic  In this paper  we describe the impact of coronavirus on our elective services and how we have implemented new patient pathways to allow us to continue providing patient care  Methodology  Data on major colorectal elective resections was prospectively collected in an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery  ERAS  database  Data on the number of proctology cases and telemed appointments were collected from the hospital theatre information management system and electronic patient record system respectively  Results  During the pandemic  there was a complete shift towards cancer cases  with benign services and proctology cases being placed on hold  Hospital length of stay was reduced  We implemented earlier hospital discharge and more intense telephone follow up after elective major surgery  This has not resulted in an increase in post-operative complications  nor any increase in readmission into hospital  During the recovery phase  we have introduced a higher proportion of telemed consultations  including one-stop telemed proctology clinics  resulting in straight to tests or investigations  Conclusions  We have created a streamlined multi-disciplinary pathway to reinstate our elective colorectal services as soon as possible and to minimise potential harm caused to patients whose treatment have been delayed  We anticipate many of these changes will be permanently incorporated into our clinical practice once the pandemic is over,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899957
4080,BACKGROUND  Italy was severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic with an excess of around 90 000 total deaths in 2020  Comparable data in 2021 are needed for monitoring the effects of the interventions adopted to control its spread and reduce the burden  This study estimates the excess mortality in Italy in the first eight months of 2021  with a focus on the working age population  METHODS  Excess mortality was estimated as difference between the number of registered deaths and the expected deaths  Expected deaths in March-December 2020 and January-August 2021 were estimated separately by sex  through an over-dispersed Poisson regression model using mortality and population data for the period 2011-2019  before the Covid-19 outbreak   The models included terms for calendar year  age group  a smooth function of week of the year and the natural logarithm of the population as offset term  Results  In the first eight months of 2021  we estimated 34 599 excess deaths   7 9  of the expected deaths   of these 3667 were among individuals of working age  25-64 years   In this age group  mortality was 8 2  higher than expected with higher excesses among men  2972 deaths   10 7   than women  695 deaths   4 1    CONCLUSIONS  The excess deaths in the first eight months of 2021 account for about one third of that registered in 2020  Current data indicate that around 5000 excess deaths are expected by the end of the year  leading to a total excess for 2021 of around 40 thousand deaths  Despite the absence of influenza in January-March 2021  a relevant excess was also observed among the working age population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939614

1334,The American Rescue Plan Act  ARPA  includes a one-year 10 percentage point increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage for Medicaid-funded home and community-based services  HCBS   The goal is to strengthen state efforts to help older adults and people with disabilities live safely in their homes and communities rather than in institutional settings during the COVID-19 pandemic  This essay provides a detailed description and analysis of this provision  including issues state governments need to consider when expending the additional federal revenue provided  It also draws lessons from the Affordable Care Act s Balancing Incentive Program to suggest insights for the potential of ARPA to promote further growth in Medicaid HCBS programs  It argues that key to success will be consultation with community stakeholders under the auspices of clear and frequent federal guidance and the development of concrete plans with which to expend the additional revenues in the most effective way possible in the limited time frame provided  The essay concludes by highlighting the importance of instituting strategies and processes for maximizing enhanced federal matching funds under ARPA in preparation for subsequent availability of substantial additional federal resources targeting Medicaid HCBS under other proposed initiatives,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983329
1498,Following the immense impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health and everyday lives world-wide  people s fear of COVID-19 has been studied in a number of settings using the Fear of COVID scale  In Sweden  virus-preventing strategies have differed from comparable countries  with low use of formal lock-down procedures  It is crucial to study correlates of non-compliance with COVID-19 recommendations  and unwillingness to become vaccinated  This study aims to study whether fear of COVID is associated with mental distress and attitudes towards the pandemic  and to study correlates of non-compliance with key anti-COVID recommendations and with reluctancy to vaccination  This anonymous online survey study in web panel participants  N   1 501  aimed to study a range of behavioral changes during COVID-19  Recommendations and vaccinations reluctancy were analyzed in logistic regressions against socio-demographic data  COVID-19 status  and mental health history  Internal consistency of the Fear of COVID scale was calculated  The Fear of COVID scale had a satisfactory internal consistency  Cronbach-alpha 0 84   and was significantly associated with compliance with all COVID-19 recommendations and with mental health  Non-compliance with recommendations was associated with low fear of disease and younger age  among other variables  Being against vaccination was associated  among other variables  with low fear of disease and with low education  In conclusion  the Fear of COVID scale appears to be associated with key attitudes towards the COVID-19 disease  Anti-virus strategies may need to promote compliance with recommendations in subgroups who feel low fear of disease or who believe not to be in a risk group for severe disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981036
5970,OBJECTIVES  To estimate the frequency and factors associated with foregone and delayed medical care attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic among nonelderly adults from August to December 2020 in the United States  METHODS  We used three survey waves from the Urban Institute s Household Pulse Survey  HPS  collected between August 19-31  October 14-26 and December 9-21  The final sample included 155 825 nonelderly  18-64  respondents representing 135 835 598 million individuals in the United States  We used two multivariable logistic regressions to estimate the association between respondents  characteristics and foregone and delayed care  RESULTS  The frequency of foregone and delayed medical care was 26 9  and 35 9   respectively  Around 60  of respondents reported difficulties in paying for usual household expenses in the last 7 days  More than half reported several days of mental health issues  The regression results indicated that foregone or delayed care were significantly associated with difficulties in paying usual household expenses  p < 0 001   worse self-reported health status  p < 0 001   increased mental health problems  p < 0 001   Veterans Affairs  p <0 001  or Medicaid  p   0 003  coverage compared to private healthcare coverage  and older age groups  Individuals who participated in the latter two waves of the survey  October  December  were less likely to report foregone and delayed care compared to those who participated in Wave 1  August   CONCLUSION  Overall  the frequency of foregone and delayed medical care remained high from August to December 2020 among nonelderly US adults  Our findings highlight that pandemic-induced access barriers are major drivers of reduced healthcare provision during the second half of the pandemic and highlight the need for policies to support patients in seeking timely care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910347

1025,OBJECTIVES  The aim of this study is to determine the factors that may be related to the headache experienced by health-care professionals in the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  METHODS  The target population of the study consisted of the health-care professionals working in the COVID-19 pandemic  The questionnaire form consisted of 40 questions  The demographic information of the participants  the presence of contact with the COVID-19 patient  they used which personal protective equipment  PPE  and how often  the effect of the pandemic process on the lifestyle  the presence of visual defects  the effect of the pandemic process on water consumption  the presence of old or de novo headaches  the factors that may affect this headache  and the factors that reduce the pain were questioned in the survey  RESULTS  A total of 177 health-care professionals participated in the study  About 93 8  of the participants use masks daily for more than 4 h  About 62 7  of the participants stated that their water consumption increased on the days when they used PPE  About 72 3  of the participants reported disruption in sleep patterns  83 1  of them reported increase in their stress and anxiety  About 65 5  of the participants experienced headaches during the pandemic process  They reported that the most likely causes of headache were excessive sweating and difficulty in breathing due to the use of PPE  CONCLUSION  During the pandemic  a substantial portion of health-care professionals experiences headaches  Besides the physical difficulties caused by the use of PPE  the stress caused by the pandemic process should not be ignored,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988962
3945,A key question in SARS-CoV-2 infection is why viral loads and patient outcomes vary dramatically across individuals  Because spatial-temporal dynamics of viral spread and immune response are challenging to study in vivo  we developed Spatial Immune Model of Coronavirus  SIMCoV   a scalable computational model that simulates hundreds of millions of lung cells  including respiratory epithelial cells and T cells  SIMCoV replicates viral growth dynamics observed in patients and shows how spatially dispersed infections can lead to increased viral loads  The model also shows how the timing and strength of the T cell response can affect viral persistence  oscillations  and control  By incorporating spatial interactions  SIMCoV provides a parsimonious explanation for the dramatically different viral load trajectories among patients by varying only the number of initial sites of infection and the magnitude and timing of the T cell immune response  When the branching airway structure of the lung is explicitly represented  we find that virus spreads faster than in a 2D layer of epithelial cells  but much more slowly than in an undifferentiated 3D grid or in a well-mixed differential equation model  These results illustrate how realistic  spatially explicit computational models can improve understanding of within-host dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941862
7654,The selection and engineering of materials is a critical component towards the development of a circular economy model  The redesign of both consumer commodity goods and advanced products may not only require engineering feats in terms of advanced structures but also the implementation of safer and more facile to recycle materials  Although such endeavours include the engineering of goods generated from clever components assemblies  easier to dismantle and separate  new avenues to move beyond planned obsolescence towards triggered obsolescence  whereby materials may degrade on command  is required  Circular Materials must be designed to enable complete recycling of materials and novel synthesis strategies free from toxic precursors or by-products to regenerate raw materials  Circular materials shall therefore be processed first at the local level for local needs  Key supply-chain challenges arising from the COVID-19 lockdowns have further stressed the relevance of this issue and the need to have develop well dispatched geographically manufacturing hubs  Changes towards Circular Materials considerations will depend on the development of repurposing and recycling platforms as well as from the rebirth of delocalized manufacturing capabilities  This chapter will present current solutions to develop sustainable materials engineering strategies and focus on greener fabrication and recycling routes  Focus on smarter designs and life-cycle analysis will reflect on how Circular Design of materials may contribute to the Circular Economy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888565
8573,Background National guidance stipulates the essential components of a safe handover  Shift-based work and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased turnover and re-deployment of staff into new clinical areas  creating challenges in delivering effective handovers  Aim The aim of this quality improvement project  QIP  was to improve adherence to a local standardised handover proforma to improve the quality and consistency of handovers  Methods Handovers were assessed by measuring the completion rates of the essential components of a safe handover as outlined in the national guidance  Data were collected from an electronic handover system which follows the Situation  Background  Assessment and Recommendations  SBAR  structure  and percentage completion rates obtained for each component assessed  Following baseline measurement  four Plan-Do-Study-Act  PDSA  cycles were completed between August 2020 and February 2021 across two junior doctor rotations and during a COVID surge rota  Results A total of 710 handovers were assessed across the four PDSA cycles  There were overall improvements in the percentage completion rates of each component compared to baseline  Under  Situation   admission dates increased by 13 7   estimated discharge date by 33 3  and 100  completion rate maintained for the presenting complaint  Under  Background   past medical history remained static  with a 12 1  increase in documentation of a social history  Under  Assessment   escalation status increased by 335   issues list by 242  and important updates by 35 2   Under  Recommendations   completion rate for plans was maintained at 100   Conclusions Our findings demonstrated an overall improvement in the majority of components of the handover proforma  Challenges remain with the rotation of junior doctors through different specialties leading to a loss of institutional knowledge and reduced longevity of the intervention s effect  exacerbated by the introduction of the COVID surge rota  A long-lasting improvement may require a shift to a completely electronic patient records system  ePR  which incorporates a handover tool,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873500
2858,The global Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has accelerated vaccine development at an unprecedented rate  A large population of people have received COVID-19 vaccines  while the vaccine safety data are limited  Here  we reported two cases of herpetic keratitis that occurred soon after receiving the inactivated COVID-19 vaccines  Case 1 was a 60-year-old woman who underwent penetrating keratoplasty  PKP  one year ago for corneal scarring caused by herpes simplex keratitis  HSK   and case 2 was a 51-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history  Both patients developed herpetic keratitis  HSK and varicella-zoster virus corneal endotheliitis  respectively  soon after receiving the inactivated COVID-19 vaccines  Sinovac   Herpetic keratitis was treated successfully with topical or plus oral antiviral ganciclovir  The short latency time in these two cases suggested that an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine may have a risk of triggering ocular herpes virus reactivation  Both clinicians and patients should be aware of this phenomenon  However  a causal relationship awaits confirmation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960139
8807,Emerging research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  shows that it is spreading to multiple organs in addition to the respiratory system  Though the SARS-CoV2 enters the human body by binding to ACE2 receptors on pulmonary alveolar cells  recent studies indicate that it is spreading to the central nervous system  cardiac and skeletal muscles leading to various pathological conditions in these organs  In particular  the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on triggering the cytokine storm and its consequential effects on skeletal muscles has generated a lot of discussion  The effects of this virus on muscular function especially in susceptible elderly populations is still being explored  However  its effects on diaphragm  a respiratory muscle which plays an important role in determining lung capacity are not completely explored  Currently  as new evidence on using lung ultrasounds to confirm COVID-19 diagnosis is gaining traction  it is necessary to explore the role of diaphragm in treating COVID-19 patients  This article will review the effects of cytokine storm triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant effects on skeletal muscle with a specific focus on the diaphragm in order to identify knowledge gaps in effectively treating COVID-19 patients  especially those who are on a mechanical ventilator,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870147
5268,BACKGROUND  The 2019 novel coronavirus disease  COVID-19  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus  SARS-CoV-2  is a current worldwide threat for which the immunological features after infection need to be investigated  The aim of this study was to establish a highly sensitive and quantitative detection method for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and to compare the antibody reaction difference in patients with different disease severity  RESULTS  Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to establish an indirect IgG ELISA detection system  The sensitivity of the ELISA was 100  with a specificity of 96 8  and a 98 3  concordance when compared to a colloidal gold kit  in addition  the sensitivity of the ELISA was 100  with a specificity of 98 9  and a 99 4  concordance when compared to a SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein IgG antibody ELISA kit  The increased sensitivity resulted in a higher rate of IgG antibody detection for COVID-19 patients  Moreover  the quantitative detection can be conducted with a much higher serum dilution  1 400 vs 1 10  1 400 vs 1 100   The antibody titers of 88 patients with differing COVID-19 severity at their early convalescence ranged from 800 to 102 400  and the geometric mean titer for severe and critical cases  moderate cases  asymptomatic and mild cases was 51 203  20 912  and 9590 respectively  CONCLUSION  The development of a highly sensitive ELISA system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies is described herein  This system enabled a quantitative study of rSARS-CoV-2-N IgG antibody titers in COVID-19 patients  the occurrence of higher IgG antibody titers were found to be correlated with more severe cases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922455
712,ABSTRACT  Epidemiological evidence and models have demonstrated that the current COVID-19 pandemic introduces a significant public risk to implementing large-scale community evacuations in response to disasters  While guidance documented in the US Environmental Protection Agency Protective Action Guidance  PAG  Manual is widely accepted as the standard basis for public and emergency worker protective actions for a radiological emergency  it is based primarily on assessing the risks associated with the radiological factors alone  However  as demonstrated in response to the nuclear incident in Fukushima  these events seldom occur in isolation from other risk-inducing events  Today  the COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant public health risk that must also be considered alongside the radiation risks in determining appropriate public and emergency worker protection action decisions  In particular  the significant public health risks associated with community transmission and mortality of COVID-19 challenge our most familiar and rehearsed radiological response strategies  The 1992 and 2017 US Environmental Protection Agency PAG manuals allow for considerations in protective action decision making  Much of the radiation emergency response community has been conditioned through decades of structured training and exercises to focus public protection considerations on specific guidelines referenced numerically in tables within the manual  Discussion regarding adjustment of specific PAG values is provided in the footnotes and bases portions of the PAG manual but is often not included in jurisdictional plans or routinely considered in exercises  However  when properly applied  the protective action guidance provides the necessary flexibility for decision-makers to account for additional public health risks or impediments  and jurisdictions can use this guidance to build a more effective response strategy  The authors have applied the full guidance and flexibility provided in the 2017 US Environmental Protection Agency PAG Manual to develop more specific guidance for their respective jurisdictions  radiation emergency response plans and will outline a process for consideration of protective action decisions to maximize the protection of public health and safety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995225
5246,BACKGROUND  Mifepristone  used together with misoprostol  is approved by the US Food   Drug Administration for medication abortion through 10 weeks  gestation  While in-person ultrasound is frequently used to establish medication abortion eligibility  prior research demonstrates that people seeking abortion early in pregnancy can accurately self-assess gestational duration using date of their last menstrual period  LMP   In the present study  we establish the screening performance of a broader set of questions for self-assessment of gestational duration among a sample of people seeking abortion at a wide range of gestations  METHODS  We surveyed patients seeking abortion at 7 facilities prior to ultrasound and compared self-assessment of gestational duration using 11 pregnancy dating questions to measurement on ultrasound  For individual pregnancy dating questions and combined questions  we established screening performance focusing on metrics of diagnostic accuracy  defined as the area under the receiver operating curve  AUC   sensitivity  or the proportion of people ineligible for medication abortion who correctly screen as such  and proportion false negative  defined as the proportion of the total sample who screen as eligible when they are not  We tested for differences across individual and combined questions in sensitivity  using McNemar s test  and in accuracy  using AUC and Sidak s adjusted p-values  RESULTS  One-quarter  25   of 1 089 participants were >70 days  gestation on ultrasound  Using date of LMP alone demonstrated 83 5   95  CI  78 4  87 9  sensitivity at identifying people >70 days on ultrasound  with AUC of 0 82  95  CI  0 79  0 85  and proportion false negative 4 0   A composite measure of responses to number of weeks pregnant  date of LMP  and date got pregnant questions demonstrated 89 1  sensitivity  95  CI  84 7   92 6   and AUC of 0 86  95  CI  0 83  0 88   with 2 7  false negative  A simpler question set focused on being >10 weeks or 2 months pregnant or having missed 2 or more periods had comparable sensitivity  90 7   95  CI  86 6  93 9  and proportion false negative  2 3    but with slightly lower AUC  0 82  95  CI  0 79  0 84   CONCLUSIONS  In a sample representative of people seeking abortion nationally  broadening the screening questions used to assess gestational duration beyond date of LMP results in improved accuracy and sensitivity of self-assessment at the 70-day threshold for medication abortion  Ultrasound assessment for MA may not be necessary  especially when requiring ultrasound could increases COVID-19 risk or healthcare costs  restrict access  or limit patient choice,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922922
9422,BACKGROUND  There is an urgent need to inform policy deliberations about whether children with asthma should be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and  if so  which subset of children with asthma should be prioritised  We were asked by the UK s Joint Commission on Vaccination and Immunisation to undertake an urgent analysis to identify which children with asthma were at increased risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes  METHODS  This national incident cohort study was done in all children in Scotland aged 5-17 years who were included in the linked dataset of Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19  EAVE II   We used data from EAVE II to investigate the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among children with markers of uncontrolled asthma defined by either previous asthma hospital admission or oral corticosteroid prescription in the previous 2 years  A Cox proportional hazard model was used to derive hazard ratios  HRs  and 95  CIs for the association between asthma and COVID-19 hospital admission  stratified by markers of asthma control  previous asthma hospital admission and number of previous prescriptions for oral corticosteroids within 2 years of the study start date   Analyses were adjusted for age  sex  socioeconomic status  comorbidity  and previous hospital admission  FINDINGS  Between March 1  2020  and July 27  2021  752 867 children were included in the EAVE II dataset  63 463  8 4   of whom had clinician-diagnosed-and-recorded asthma  Of these  4339  6 8   had RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  In those with confirmed infection  67  1 5   were admitted to hospital with COVID-19  Among the 689 404 children without asthma  40 231  5 8   had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections  of whom 382  0 9   were admitted to hospital with COVID-19  The rate of COVID-19 hospital admission was higher in children with poorly controlled asthma than in those with well controlled asthma or without asthma  When using previous hospital admission for asthma as the marker of uncontrolled asthma  the adjusted HR was 6 40  95  CI 3 27-12 53  for those with poorly controlled asthma and 1 36  1 02-1 80  for those with well controlled asthma  compared with those with no asthma  When using oral corticosteroid prescriptions as the marker of uncontrolled asthma  the adjusted HR was 3 38  1 84-6 21  for those with three or more prescribed courses of corticosteroids  3 53  1 87-6 67  for those with two prescribed courses of corticosteroids  1 52  0 90-2 57  for those with one prescribed course of corticosteroids  and 1 34  0 98-1 82  for those with no prescribed course  compared with those with no asthma  INTERPRETATION  School-aged children with asthma with previous recent hospital admission or two or more courses of oral corticosteroids are at markedly increased risk of COVID-19 hospital admission and should be considered a priority for vaccinations  This would translate into 9124 children across Scotland and an estimated 109 448 children across the UK  FUNDING  UK Research and Innovation  Medical Research Council   Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund  Health Data Research UK  and Scottish Government,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861180
9179,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world  Women may be especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic  AIMS  This study attempted to assess how gender affects risk perceptions  anxiety levels and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan  to recommend gender-responsive health policies  METHODS  A cross-sectional online survey was conducted  Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form  the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  and questions on their risk perceptions  preventive behaviour and information exposure  Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of factors such as age  gender and household income on anxiety levels  RESULTS  Of the 1391 respondents  478 were women and 913 were men  Women considered their chances of survival to be relatively lower than men  59  v  73    They were also more anxious  62  v  50   and more likely to adopt precautionary behaviour  such as avoiding going to the hospital  78  v  71    not going to work  72  v  57   and using disinfectants  93  v  86    Men were more likely to trust friends  family and social media as reliable sources of COVID-19 information  whereas women were more likely to trust doctors  CONCLUSIONS  Women experience a disproportionate burden of the psychological and social impact of the pandemic compared with men  Involving doctors in healthcare communication targeting women might prove effective  Social media and radio programmes may be effective in disseminating COVID-19-related information to men,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865675
8138,Background  The endorsement of Conspiracy Beliefs concerning corona  CBc  may make people reject information from the general media  leading them to not follow recommendations on prevention behaviours  getting tested  and getting vaccinated  The aim of the present study was to understand the relationship between CBc and engaging in these corona-related behaviours  Method  Two samples of participants  N   1 004 and N   159  were recruited independently  Participants filled in a survey that assessed four indicators of the three behaviours  four general psychological determinants  e g   the seriousness of COVID-19   five behaviour-specific psychological determinants  e g   test reliability  vaccine effectiveness   and CBc  Results  The explained variances of the different models with regard to the four indicators of behaviour ranged from 3 9 to 75   Mediation analyses using Hayes PROCESS model 4 showed significant mediation by general determinants in both samples  and mediation by several behaviour-specific determinants in one sample  Discussion  Conspiracy Beliefs concerning corona may lead to rejection of general media information  and this may lead to states of psychological determinants that do not stimulate to engage in prevention behaviours  testing  or vaccination  The present study shedS some light on how CBc could be related to corona-related behaviours,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880807
3007,Although some COVID-19 patients maintain SARS-CoV-2-specific serum immunoglobulin G  IgG  for more than 6 months postinfection  others eventually lose IgG levels  We assessed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells in 17 patients  5 of whom had lost specific IgGs after 5-8 months  Differentiation of blood-derived B cells in vitro revealed persistent SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG B cells in all patients  whereas IgA B cells were maintained in 11  Antibodies derived from cultured B cells blocked binding of viral receptor-binding domain  RBD  to the cellular receptor ACE-2  had neutralizing activity to authentic virus  and recognized the RBD of the variant of concern Alpha similarly to the wild type  whereas reactivity to Beta and Gamma were decreased  Thus  differentiation of memory B cells could be more sensitive for detecting previous infection than measuring serum antibodies  Understanding the persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells even in the absence of specific serum IgG will help to promote long-term immunity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957380

6266,As a means to preserve present and future generations  living conditions  sustainable consumption presents a route to the enhanced well-being of individuals  However  the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic raises the question of whether society is going to continue down a path of increased awareness of sustainable consumption or whether the pandemic will move people to focus more on themselves  Based on data gathered before and near the end of the first pandemic lockdown in Germany in spring 2020  this research demonstrates that ecological  social  and voluntary simplicity consciousness deteriorated in the minds of sustainability-conscious consumers  with notable impacts on their willingness to spend sustainably and their shopping affinity  Furthermore  we identify segments that show particular vulnerability to the lockdown by reacting with a decrease in their ecological consumption consciousness  This study concludes with a discussion of the pandemic s implications for the spread of sustainable consumption styles and human well-being,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908580
4786,OBJECTIVE  SARS-CoV-2 has spread beyond the world and makes a new challenge in the breastfeeding issue  There is some disagreement among breastfeeding management in confirmed COVID-19 patients China consensus but no evidence shows the transmission via breastfeeding  This paper aims to know the risk of transmission through breastfeeding in COVID-19 patients and antibodies in breast milk  METHOD  We conducted a literature review of publicly available information to summarize knowledge about risk transmission through breastfeeding and antibody in mother confirmed COVID-19  RESULT  A maternal woman was positive for COVID-19 in throat swabs show negative SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk  No evidence suggests the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to baby via vertical route or breast milk  IgG and IgA were detected in breast milk and potentially against SARS-CoV-2  CONCLUSION  Mother with COVID-19 can continuing direct breastfeeding with appropriate hygiene precautions  using a mask and wash hand  and should remain separate  home isolation precautions  from other family members including the infant  except for breastfeeding,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929891
6249,Objective  We investigate how beliefs about scientists and presidents affect views about two pandemics  Zika virus  2016  and COVID-19  2020   Methods  Three New Hampshire surveys in 2016 and 2020 provide data to test how beliefs about scientists  practices and presidential approval relate to pandemic views  Results  Support for presidents consistently predicts perceptions of scientists  integrity and trust in science agencies for information  but the directionality changes from 2016 to 2020-increased trust among Obama-supporters  decreased trust among Trump-supporters  Respondents who believe scientists lack objectivity are also less likely to trust science agencies during both Zika and COVID-19 and are less apt to be confident in the government s response in 2016  Assessments of pandemic responses become increasingly political during 2020  most notably  support for President Trump strongly predicts confidence in the government s efforts  Conclusion  Results highlight how beliefs about scientists  practices and presidents are central to the science-politics nexus during pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908603
2626,The current global pandemic due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  has taken a substantial number of lives across the world  Although few vaccines have been rolled-out  a number of vaccine candidates are still under clinical trials at various pharmaceutical companies and laboratories around the world  Considering the intrinsic nature of viruses in mutating and evolving over time  persistent efforts are needed to develop better vaccine candidates  In this study  various immuno-informatics tools and bioinformatics databases were deployed to derive consensus B-cell and T-cell epitope sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  This approach has identified four potential epitopes which have the capability to initiate both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses  are non-allergenic and do not trigger autoimmunity  These peptide sequences were also evaluated to show 99 82  of global population coverage based on the genotypic frequencies of HLA binding alleles for both MHC class-I and class-II and are unique for SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human as a host species  Epitope number 2 alone had a global population coverage of 98 2   Therefore  we further validated binding and interaction of its constituent T-cell epitopes with their corresponding HLA proteins using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation experiments  followed by binding free energy calculations with molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area  essential dynamics analysis and free energy landscape analysis  The immuno-informatics pipeline described and the candidate epitopes discovered herein could have significant impact upon efforts to develop globally effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962259

1370,Severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS -CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by remarkable differences  including infectivity and case fatality rate  The underlying mechanisms are not well understood  illustrating major knowledge gaps of coronavirus biology  In this study  protein expression of the SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-infected human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 was analyzed using data-independent acquisition-mass spectrometry  This resulted in a comprehensive map of infection-related proteome-wide expression changes in human cells covering the quantification of 7478 proteins across four time points  Most notably  the activation of interferon type-I response was observed  which is surprisingly absent in several proteome studies  The data reveal that SARS-CoV-2 triggers interferon-stimulated gene expression much stronger than SARS-CoV  which reflects the already described differences in interferon sensitivity  Potentially  this may be caused by the enhanced abundance of the viral M protein of SARS-CoV in comparison to SARS-CoV-2  which is a known inhibitor of type I interferon expression  This study expands the knowledge on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infections on a global scale using an infection model  which seems to be well suited to analyze the innate immunity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982558
1418,OBJECTIVES  The aim was to compare the prevalence of acute infection and seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers  HCWs  and medical students  MATERIAL AND METHODS  A high-volume  single-center analysis was conducted in the period of July 1August 1  2020  at the Semmelweis University  Naso- and oropharyngeal samples were collected for polymerase chain reaction  PCR   and blood samples for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG  A questionnaire was also administered about the infection symptoms and the obtained results were assessed by profession and site of care delivery  RESULTS  From the total cohort  N   7948   4478  56   and 3470  44   were health professionals and medical students  respectively  They were mainly female  67    and the mean age of HCWs and students was 40 and 25 years  respectively  By profession  physicians  1 5   and other HCWs  1 8   showed a comparable SARS-CoV-2 exposure  International students had the highest  2 1    whereas Hungarian students had the lowest  0 6   prevalence of seropositivity  The highest prevalence was detected among the staff of COVID-19 wards  12 1    By PCR  medical students showed the lowest occurrence of active infection with a prevalence of 0 17   while physicians and other HCWs had a higher prevalence  1 46  and 1 71   respectively   By site of care delivery  positive test results were the most frequent at COVID-19 wards  3 8    CONCLUSIONS  Physicians and other HCWs showed comparable SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity prevalence  approximately twice as high as in the general population of Budapest  Hungarian students had lower prevalence of seropositivity than this reference  High prevalence among international students suggests that they had imported the infection  The very high prevalence of documented exposure among staff members at COVID-19 wards urges for improving the safety measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981793

3282,OBJECTIVE  The objective of this study was to present clinician and caregiver perspectives regarding telehealth neurodevelopmental evaluation delivered at the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  Specifically  we sought to describe telehealth neurodevelopmental evaluations  examine associations between child characteristics and diagnostic factors  determine the impact of technology and family barriers  and report on clinician and caregiver satisfaction with telehealth evaluation  METHODS  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic  in-person clinical services at a large children s hospital neurodevelopmental clinic were transitioned to telehealth  Data are presented for 254 remote evaluations of children  18-212 months  referral concern  51  autism spectrum disorder  ASD   24  developmental delay intellectual disability  25  other neurodevelopmental concern  conducted from May to July 2020  Data were gathered from electronic health records as well as clinician and caregiver surveys  RESULTS  A clinical diagnosis was provided in 72  of telehealth evaluations  Clinicians rated diagnostic certainty as  completely  or  somewhat  certain in 74  of evaluations  Certainty ratings were higher for evaluations in which a diagnosis of ASD was provided  Although technology and family challenges were reported  clinicians rarely identified these as disruptive to the evaluation process  Clinicians reported satisfaction with various aspects of delivering telehealth  Caregivers endorsed high satisfaction with receipt of telehealth and reduced travel burden  CONCLUSION  The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed service delivery for individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities and provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the deployment of telehealth evaluation to meet the need for ongoing diagnostic care  Our findings suggest that telehealth holds significant promise for neurodevelopmental assessment both within the context of a global pandemic and beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954761
2688,The health system failed to guarantee the safety of both professionals and citizens who came to the centers at the beginning of the pandemic  The lack of materials and guidelines for the prevention of infections caused in Spain the worst catastrophe in the history of patient safety and occupational health in healthcare  It also happened in other countries but Spain had the highest rates of infected health workers in the world  It was a largely avoidable event  We review what measures have been taken to prevent infections in primary care centers  such as hand hygiene  masks and personal protection material or the maintenance of social distance  among others  We update the recommendations and raise the perspectives in a situation that requires flexibility and adaptability to maintain quality and safe care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961578
3429,Fatal infectious diseases caused by RNA viruses  such as COVID-19  have emerged around the world  RT-PCR is widely employed for virus detection  and its accuracy depends on the primers and probes since RT-PCR can detect a virus only when the primers and probes bind to the target gene of the virus  Most of primer design methods are for a single host and so require a great deal of effort to design for RNA virus detection  including homology tests among the host and all the viruses for the host using BLAST-like tools  Furthermore  they do not consider variant sequences  which are very common in viruses  In this study  we describe VPrimer  a method of designing high-quality primer-probe sets for RNA viruses  VPrimer can find primer-probe sets that cover more than 95  of the variants of a target virus but do not cover any sequences of other viruses or the host  With VPrimer  we found 381 698 582 primer-probe sets for 3 104 RNA viruses  Multiplex PCR assays using the top 2 primer-probe sets suggested by VPrimer usually cover 100  of variants  To address the rapid changes in viral genomes  VPrimer finds the best and up-to-date primer-probe sets incrementally against the most recently reported variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951850
5386,COVID-19 vaccination efficacy depends on serum levels of the neutralizing antibodies  NAs  specific to the receptor-binding domain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  spike protein  Therefore  a high-throughput rapid assay capable of measuring the total SARS-CoV-2 NA level is urgently needed for COVID-19 serodiagnosis  convalescent plasma therapy  vaccine development  and assessment  Here  we developed a novel nanoplasmonic immunosorbent assay  NanoPISA  platform for one-step rapid quantification of SARS-CoV-2 NAs in clinical serum samples for high-throughput evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness  The NanoPISA platform enhanced by the use of nanoporous hollow gold nanoparticle coupling was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 NAs with a limit of detection of 0 2 pM within 15 min without washing steps  The one-step NanoPISA for SARS-CoV-2 NA detection in clinical specimens yielded good results  comparable with those obtained in the gold-standard seroneutralization test and the surrogate virus-neutralizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  Collectively  the one-step NanoPISA might be a rapid and high-throughput NA-quantification platform for evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920226
8581,Robots have been slowly but steadily introduced to welfare sectors  Our previous observations based on a large-scale survey study on Finnish elder-care workers in 2016 showed that while robots were perceived to be useful in certain telecare tasks  using robots may also prove to be incompatible with the care workers  personal values  The current study presents the second wave of the survey data from 2020  with the same respondents  N   190   and shows how these views have changed for the positive  including higher expectations of telecare robotization and decreased concerns over care robots  compatibility with personal values  In a longitudinal analysis  Phase 1   the positive change in views toward telecare robots was found to be influenced by the care robots  higher value compatibility  In an additional cross-sectional analysis  Phase 2   focusing on the factors underlying personal values  care robots  value compatibility was associated with social norms toward care robots  the threat of technological unemployment  and COVID-19 stress  The significance of social norms in robot acceptance came down to more universal ethical standards of care work rather than shared norms in the workplace  COVID-19 stress did not explain the temporal changes in views about robot use in care but had a role in assessments of the compatibility between personal values and care robot use  In conclusion  for care workers to see potential in care robots  the new technology must support ethical standards of care work  such as respectfulness  compassion  and trustworthiness of the nurse-patient interaction  In robotizing care work  personal values are significant predictors of the task values,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873425
2413,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Although there is evidence of disruption in acute cerebrovascular and cardiovascular care during the COVID-19 pandemic  its downstream effect in primary care is less clear  We investigated how the pandemic affected utilization of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular care in general practices  GPs  and determined changes in GP-recorded diagnoses of selected cerebrovascular and cardiovascular outcomes  METHODS  From electronic health records of 166 929 primary care patients aged 30 or over within the Rotterdam region  the Netherlands  we extracted the number of consultations related to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular care  and first diagnoses of selected cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk factors  hypertension  diabetes  lipid disorders   conditions and events  angina  atrial fibrillation  TIA  myocardial infarction  stroke   We quantified changes in those outcomes during the first COVID-19 wave  March-May 2020  and thereafter  June-December 2020  by comparing them to the same period in 2016-2019  We also estimated the number of potentially missed diagnoses for each outcome  RESULTS  The number of GP consultations related to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular care declined by 38   0 62  95  CI  0 56-0 68  during the first wave  as compared to expected counts based on pre-pandemic levels  Substantial declines in the number of new diagnoses were observed for cerebrovascular events  37  for TIA  0 63  0 41-0 96   and 29  for stroke  0 71  0 59 to 0 84   while no significant changes were observed for cardiovascular events  myocardial infarction  0 91  0 74-1 14   angina  0 77  0 48-1 25    The counts across individual diagnoses recovered following June 2020  but the number of GP consultations related to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular care remained lower than expected also throughout the June-December period  0 93  0 88-0 98   DISCUSSION  While new diagnoses of acute cardiovascular events remained stable during the COVID19 pandemic  diagnoses of cerebrovascular events declined substantially compared to pre-pandemic levels  possibly due to incorrect perception of risk by patients  These findings emphasize the need to improve symptom recognition of cerebrovascular events among the general public and to encourage urgent presentation despite any physical distancing measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965968
1729,Background  Cytokine release syndrome can be observed during the course of COVID-19  Tocilizumab is used for treating this highly fatal syndrome  We think that the starting time of tocilizumab is important  In this article  we aimed to discuss the efficacy of tocilizumab and to review the necessity of starting it in the early period and the laboratory values that guide us in determining the time of this early period  Methods  This retrospective study includes a total of 308 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 who were treated with tocilizumab  who were hospitalized in the University of Health Sciences  Gazi Yasargil Training and Research Hospital between July 2020 and December 2020  The data of the patients were recorded on the day of hospitalization  the day of taking tocilizumab  day 0   and the 1st day  3rd day  7th day  and 14th day after taking tocilizumab  Data included age  gender  underlying diseases  where the patient was followed  duration of symptoms before admission to the hospital  duration of oxygen demand before tocilizumab  fever  saturation  and laboratory values  Patients were divided into the mortality group  group 1  and the survival group  group 2   and all data were compared  Results  The study consisted of 308 COVID-19 patients divided into two groups  the mortality group  group 1  n   135  and the survival group  group 2  n   173   The median age of the patients was 60  min-max  50-70  years  75 3   n   232  were male  and 56 8  had at least one comorbidity  While 88 9  of group 1 was in the intensive care unit  26 6  of group 2 received tocilizumab while in the intensive care unit  and there was a statistically significant difference  Median SpO2 values and lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2  both on the day of hospitalization and on the day of the first dose of tocilizumab treatment  p < 0 001 for both   C-reactive protein  d-dimer  and alanine aminotransferase values were higher in the mortal group on the first day of hospitalization  and this was significant  p   0 021  p   0 001  and p   0 036  respectively   In our study  d-dimer was 766 5 ng mL in the survivor group and 988 5 ng mL in the mortal group  In our patient group  the mean lymphocyte count was 700 x 10 3  mm 3  in the group that survived the first day of TCZ and 500 x 10 3  mm 3  in the mortal group  In addition  the CRP value was 135 5 mg L in the survivor group and 169 mg L in the mortal group  There was no difference between ferritin values  Conclusions  Tocilizumab is still among the COVID-19 treatment options and appears to be effective  But the start time is important  In order to increase its effectiveness  it may be important to know a cut-off value of the laboratory findings required for the diagnosis of cytokine release syndrome  Further studies are needed for this,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977235
735,Importance  Patients with solid cancer are more susceptible to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe complications  the immunogenicity in patients treated with anticancer agents remains unknown  Objective  To assess the immune humoral response to 2 or 3 doses of the BNT162b2  BioNTech  Pfizer  vaccine in patients treated with anticancer agents  Design  Setting  and Participants  A prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 1 and May 31  2021  Adults treated with anticancer agents who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine were included  of these  individuals with a weak humoral response 1 month after the second dose received a third injection  Interventions  Quantitative serologic testing of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 was conducted before vaccination and during follow-up  Main Outcomes and Measures  Humoral response was evaluated with a threshold of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels at 1000 arbitrary units  AU  mL to neutralize less-sensitive COVID-19 variants  Results  Among 163 patients  median  range  age  66  27-89  years  86 men  53    with solid tumors who received 2 or 3 doses of vaccine  122 individuals  75   were treated with chemotherapy  15 with immunotherapy  9    and 26 with targeted therapies  16    The proportions of patients with an anti-S immunoglobulin G titer greater than 1000 AU mL were 15   22 of 145  at the time of the second vaccination and 65   92 of 142  28 days after the second vaccination  Humoral response decreased 3 months after the second dose  Treatment type was associated with humoral response  in particular  time between vaccine and chemotherapy did not interfere with the humoral response  Among 36 patients receiving a third dose of vaccine  a serologic response greater than 1000 AU mL occurred in 27 individuals  75    Conclusions and Relevance  The results of this cohort study appear to support the use of a third vaccine dose among patients with active cancer treatment for solid tumors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994776
4718,New generation plasmid DNA vaccines may be a safe  fast and simple emergency vaccine platform for preparedness against emerging viral pathogens  Applying platform optimization strategies  we tested the pre-clinical immunogenicity and protective effect of a candidate DNA plasmid vaccine specific for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The DNA vaccine induced spike-specific binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies in mice  rabbits  and rhesus macaques together with robust Th1 dominant cellular responses in small animals  Intradermal and intramuscular needle-free administration of the DNA vaccine yielded comparable immune responses  In a vaccination-challenge study of rhesus macaques  the vaccine demonstrated protection from viral replication in the lungs following intranasal and intratracheal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2  In conclusion  the candidate plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is immunogenic in different models and confers protection against lung infection in nonhuman primates  Further evaluation of this DNA vaccine candidate in clinical trials is warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930909
4347,Background  Telemedicine use increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns for patient and provider safety  Given the lack of testing resources initially and the large geographical range served by Augusta University  AU   a telemedicine platform with up-to-date screening guidelines was implemented for COVID-19 testing in March 2020  Our objective was to understand the level of adherence to telemedicine screening guidelines for COVID-19  Methods  The study population included health care providers and population who participated in an encounter in the AU Health Express Care virtual care program from March 22 to May 21  2020  All encounters were intended to be for COVID-19 screening  free  and available 24 h per day  7 days per week  Screening guidelines were developed by AU based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Department of Public Health  Results  Among 17 801 total encounters  13 600 were included in the final analysis  Overall adherence to screening guidelines was 71  in the adult population and 57  in the pediatric population  When providers did not follow guidelines  72  determined that the patient should have a positive screen  Guidelines themselves determined that only 52  of encounters should have a positive screen  Providers  specialty significantly correlated with guideline adherence  p   0 002   Departments with the highest adherence were psychiatry  neurology  and ophthalmology  No significant correlation was found between guideline adherence and provider degree position  Conclusions  This study provides proof of concept of a free telehealth screening platform during an ongoing pandemic  Our screening experience was effective and different specialties participated  Our patient population lived in lower than average income zip codes  suggesting that our free telemedicine screening program successfully reached populations with higher financial barriers to health care  Early training and a posteriori knowledge of telemedicine was likely key to screening guideline adherence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935500
9420,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the impact of COVID-19-related disruptions on care continuity and outcomes of chronic wounds  DESIGN  Retrospective cohort study  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS  Electronic medical records for 152 225 chronic wounds from a network of 488 wound care clinics in 45 US states and the District of Columbia  METHODS  Wound and patient characteristics  the number of chronic wounds newly seen at the clinics  and 12-week healing rates were compared between the first 2 quarters of 2019 and 2020  Multivariable regression models were constructed to evaluate whether the pandemic was associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing after risk adjustment  RESULTS  During the pandemic  wound and patient characteristics did not change compared to the previous year  Case volume dropped as much as 40  in April 2020 but returned to the previous year s level by June  No systematic changes in measures of care continuity were observed  Unadjusted 12-week healing rates remained stable at 0 502 in 2019 and 0 503 in 2020  Likewise  risk-adjusted 12-week healing rates were 0 504 and 0 505 in 2019 and 2020  respectively  but the difference was not statistically significant  States with stricter lockdowns saw a greater decline in case volume  However  the pandemic was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing in most states  The percentage of wounds with 1 or more telehealth visits increased from 0 14  in 2019 to 1 04  in 2020  CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS  Despite COVID-19-related disruptions  our results suggest that wound care clinics maintained standards of care and outcomes for patients who sought care  This positive result should not detract from the problem that the number of new wounds seen at the clinics dropped sharply  Further research should evaluate outcomes in patients with unattended chronic wounds,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861225
7185,MOTIVATION  Cryo-Electron Tomography  cryo-ET  is a 3D imaging technology that enables the visualization of subcellular structures in situ at near-atomic resolution  Cellular cryo-ET images help in resolving the structures of macromolecules and determining their spatial relationship in a single cell  which has broad significance in cell and structural biology  Subtomogram classification and recognition constitute a primary step in the systematic recovery of these macromolecular structures  Supervised deep learning methods have been proven to be highly accurate and efficient for subtomogram classification  but suffer from limited applicability due to scarcity of annotated data  While generating simulated data for training supervised models is a potential solution  a sizeable difference in the image intensity distribution in generated data as compared with real experimental data will cause the trained models to perform poorly in predicting classes on real subtomograms  RESULTS  In this work  we present Cryo-Shift  a fully unsupervised domain adaptation and randomization framework for deep learning-based cross-domain subtomogram classification  We use unsupervised multi-adversarial domain adaption to reduce the domain shift between features of simulated and experimental data  We develop a network-driven domain randomization procedure with  warp  modules to alter the simulated data and help the classifier generalize better on experimental data  We do not use any labeled experimental data to train our model  whereas some of the existing alternative approaches require labeled experimental samples for cross-domain classification  Nevertheless  Cryo-Shift outperforms the existing alternative approaches in cross-domain subtomogram classification in extensive evaluation studies demonstrated herein using both simulated and experimental data  AVAILABILITYAND IMPLEMENTATION  https   github com xulabs aitom  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897387
6395,INTRODUCTION OBJECTIVES  Many health systems screen patients for social determinants of health and refer patients with social needs to community service organizations for assistance  We developed a framework based on sequential steps to evaluate this process  METHODS  We reviewed efforts by The MetroHealth System in Cleveland  Ohio and identified 6 sequential steps  patient screened  has social needs  consents to referral to a service organization  referral placed  referral accepted  and referral outcome  Referral outcomes were categorized as resolved  organization provided requested service or patient self-resolved problem   or unresolved  patient unable to be contacted or declined assistance   We then determined the numbers of patients with food insecurity who completed each step  how completion differed by patient characteristics and service organization  and reasons for failure to complete specific steps  RESULTS  We used the framework to evaluate screening and assistance steps among 5741 patients who attended a COVID-19 vaccine clinic from February 15-March 31  2021 and were followed through April 30  2021  The percentage of patients who completed each step ranged from 17-98   Step completion differed by patient age  patient race  and clinic  Of 360 referrals accepted by community organizations  98  27   were resolved  The most common reasons for unresolved referrals were inability of service organization to contact patients  151   no reason stated  71   and patients declined service  30   CONCLUSIONS  A framework based on sequential steps may be used to evaluate social determinants of health screening and assistance programs  Further work is needed to address reasons for failure to complete steps  to include patient perspectives  and to determine long-term outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905991
9516,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic created an urgent need to act to reduce the spread of the virus and alleviate congestion from healthcare services  protect healthcare providers  and help them maintain satisfactory quality and safety of care  Remote COVID-19 monitoring platforms emerged as potential solutions  Objective  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity and contribution of two different platforms used to remotely monitor patients with COVID-19 to maintain quality  safety  and patient engagement in care  as well as their acceptability  usefulness  and user-friendliness from the user s perspective  The first platform is focused on telecare phone calls  Telecare-Covid   and the second is a telemonitoring app  CareSimple-Covid   Methods  We performed a cross-sectional study  The data were collected through a phone survey from May to August 2020  Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t-test analysis  Participants  responses and comments on open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis to identify certain issues and challenges and potential avenues for improving the platforms  Results  Fifty one patients participated in the study  Eighteen participants used the CareSimple-Covid platform and 33 participants used the Telecare-Covid platform  Overall  the satisfaction rate for quality and safety of care for the two platforms was 80   Over 88  of the users on each platform considered the platforms  services to be engaging  useful  user-friendly  and appropriate to their needs  The survey identified a few significant differences in users  perceptions of each platform  empathy toward users and the quality and safety of the care received were rated significantly higher on the CareSimple-Covid platform than on the Telecare-Covid platform  Users appreciated four aspects of these telehealth approaches   1  the ease of access to services and the availability of care team members   2  the user-friendliness of the platforms   3  the continuity of care provided  and  4  the wide range of services delivered  Users identified some technical limitations and raised certain issues  such as the importance of maintaining human contact  data security  and confidentiality  Improvement suggestions include promoting access to connected devices  enhancing communications between institutions  healthcare users  and the public on confidentiality and personal data protection standards  and integrating a participatory approach to telehealth platform development and deployment efforts  Conclusion  This study provides preliminary evidence that the two remote monitoring platforms are well-received by users  with very few significant differences between them concerning users  experiences and views  This type of program could be considered for use in a post-pandemic era and for other post-hospitalization clienteles  To maximize efficiency  the areas for improvement and the issues identified should be addressed with a patient-centered approach,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859244
2030,Characterization of protein complexes  i e  sets of proteins assembling into a single larger physical entity  is important  as such assemblies play many essential roles in cells such as gene regulation  From networks of protein-protein interactions  potential protein complexes can be identified computationally through the application of community detection methods  which flag groups of entities interacting with each other in certain patterns  Most community detection algorithms tend to be unsupervised and assume that communities are dense network subgraphs  which is not always true  as protein complexes can exhibit diverse network topologies  The few existing supervised machine learning methods are serial and can potentially be improved in terms of accuracy and scalability by using better-suited machine learning models and parallel algorithms  Here  we present Super Complex  a distributed  supervised AutoML-based pipeline for overlapping community detection in weighted networks  We also propose three new evaluation measures for the outstanding issue of comparing sets of learned and known communities satisfactorily  Super Complex learns a community fitness function from known communities using an AutoML method and applies this fitness function to detect new communities  A heuristic local search algorithm finds maximally scoring communities  and a parallel implementation can be run on a computer cluster for scaling to large networks  On a yeast protein-interaction network  Super Complex outperforms 6 other supervised and 4 unsupervised methods  Application of Super Complex to a human protein-interaction network with  8k nodes and  60k edges yields 1 028 protein complexes  with 234 complexes linked to SARS-CoV-2  the COVID-19 virus  with 111 uncharacterized proteins present in 103 learned complexes  Super Complex is generalizable with the ability to improve results by incorporating domain-specific features  Learned community characteristics can also be transferred from existing applications to detect communities in a new application with no known communities  Code and interactive visualizations of learned human protein complexes are freely available at  https   sites google com view supercomplex super-complex-v3-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972161

8685,BACKGROUND  Compelling evidence has shown cardiac involvement in COVID-19 patients  However  the overall majority of these studies use data obtained during the first wave of the pandemic  while recently differences have been reported in disease course and mortality between first- and second wave COVID-19 patients  The aim of this study was to analyze and compare cardiac pathology between first- and second wave COVID-19 patients  METHODS  Autopsied hearts from first-  n   15  and second wave  n   10  COVID-19 patients and from 18 non-COVID-19 control patients were  immuno histochemically analyzed  CD45  leukocyte  CD68  macrophage and CD3  T lymphocyte infiltration  cardiomyocyte necrosis and microvascular thrombosis were quantified  In addition  the procoagulant factors Tissue Factor  TF   Factor VII  FVII   Factor XII  FXII   the anticoagulant protein Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4  DPP4  and the advanced glycation end-product N  epsilon  -Carboxymethyllysine  CML   as markers of microvascular thrombogenicity and dysfunction  were quantified  RESULTS  Cardiac inflammation was significantly decreased in second wave compared to first wave COVID-19 patients  predominantly related to a decrease in infiltrated lymphocytes and the occurrence of lymphocytic myocarditis  This was accompanied by significant decreases in cardiomyocyte injury and microvascular thrombosis  Moreover  microvascular deposits of FVII and CML were significantly lower in second wave compared to first wave COVID-19 patients  CONCLUSIONS  These results show that in our cohort of fatal COVID-19 cases cardiac inflammation  cardiomyocyte injury and microvascular thrombogenicity were markedly decreased in second wave compared to first wave patients  This may reflect advances in COVID-19 treatment related to an increased use of steroids in the second COVID-19 wave,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871622
4613,BACKGROUND  Antimicrobial resistance has been recognised as a global threat with carbapenemase- producing-Enterobacteriaceae  CPE  as a prime example  CPE has similarities to COVID-19 where asymptomatic patients may be colonised representing a source for onward transmission  There are limited treatment options for CPE infection leading to poor outcomes and increased costs  Admission screening can prevent cross-transmission by pre-emptively isolating colonised patients  OBJECTIVE  We assess the relative cost-effectiveness of screening programmes compared with no- screening  METHODS  A microsimulation parameterised with NHS Scotland date was used to model scenarios of the prevalence of CPE colonised patients on admission  Screening strategies were  a  two-step screening involving a clinical risk assessment  CRA  checklist followed by microbiological testing of high-risk patients  and  b  universal screening  Strategies were considered with either culture or polymerase chain reaction  PCR  tests  All costs were reported in 2019 UK pounds with a healthcare system perspective  RESULTS  In the low prevalence scenario  no screening had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness  Among screening strategies  the two CRA screening options were the most likely to be cost-effective  Screening was more likely to be cost-effective than no screening in the prevalence of 1 CPE colonised in 500 admitted patients or more  There was substantial uncertainty with the probabilities rarely exceeding 40  and similar results between strategies  Screening reduced non-isolated bed-days and CPE colonisation  The cost of screening was low in relation to total costs  CONCLUSION  The specificity of the CRA checklist was the parameter with the highest impact on the cost-effectiveness  Further primary data collection is needed to build models with less uncertainty in the parameters,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932169
5790,In December of 2019  several cases of unknown atypical respiratory diseases emerged in Wuhan  Hubei Province in China  After preliminary research  it was stated that the disease is transmittable between humans and was named COVID-19  Over the course of next months  it spread all over the world by air and sea transport and caused a global pandemic which affects life of everyone now-a-days  A large number of countries  have since been forced to take precautions such as curfews  lockdowns  wearing facemasks etc  Even with vaccines being produced in mass numbers  lack of targeted therapy continues to be a major problem  According to studies so far it seems that elderly people are more vulnerable to severe symptoms while children tend to by asymptomatic or have milder form the disease  In our review  we focused on gathering data about the virus itself  its characteristics  paths of transmission  and its effect on hormone production and secretion  In such  there is insufficient information in the literature worldwide  especially the ones that focus on the effect of COVID-19 on individual organs systems within the human body  Hence  the present evidence-based study focused on the possible effects of COVID-19 on adrenal gland and gonads i e  on the process of steroidogenesis and fertility,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913350
7063,Objective  This mixed-methods exploratory study sought to address the experiences of 89 adoptive parents  heterosexual  lesbian  and gay  in the United States with school-age children in relation to the transition to remote schooling and their children s mental health during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic  Background  The transition to remote schooling and associated confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges for families  particularly when children are struggling with mental health and learning challenges  Methods  Data were collected via an online survey between May and June 2020  Before the pandemic  almost half of the children received special education services  Results  Findings revealed that although a minority of children were doing well with remote schooling  the majority were struggling due to lack of motivation and an inability to work independently  Some parents voiced challenges with teacher communication and inconsistencies across classes and were overwhelmed by the demands of their new role as proctor teacher  Some were dissatisfied with how children s school services had been implemented and noted difficulties with the online format of various services  e g   therapy was less engaging   Regarding children s mental health  half of parents said it had stayed the same  one third said it had worsened  and the remainder said it had improved  The mental health of children adopted via foster care seemed to have benefited from the additional time spent at home  Yet most children were described as struggling in part due to social isolation and loss of routine  which manifested in a variety of ways  including anxiety  schoolwork avoidance  and boundary testing  Most parents tried to show patience  tolerance  and reassurance  but more than one third reported stress and frustration associated with not knowing how to best support their children  Conclusion  The transition to remote schooling during COVID-19 may be especially challenging for adoptive families and other families whose children have higher levels of need  Implications  Findings have implications for parents  teachers  school social workers and psychologists  and other professionals who work with children and families,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898782
8503,Importance  The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable mental health consequences for children and adolescents  including the exacerbation of previously diagnosed eating disorders  Whether the pandemic is a factor associated with the concomitant increase in new-onset anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa remains unknown  Objective  To assess the incidence and severity of newly diagnosed anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa in a national sample of youth before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  Design  Setting  and Participants  This repeated cross-sectional study analyzed new eating disorder assessments that were conducted at 6 pediatric tertiary-care hospitals in Canada between January 1  2015  and November 30  2020  Patients aged 9 to 18 years with a new anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis at the index assessment were included  Exposures  COVID-19-associated public health confinement measures during the first wave of the pandemic  March 1 to November 30  2020   Main Outcomes and Measures  Primary outcomes were the incidence and hospitalization rates within 7 days of de novo anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis  Event rate trends during the first wave were compared with trends in the 5-year prepandemic period  January 1  2015  to February 28  2020  using an interrupted time series with linear regression models  Demographic and clinical variables were compared using a chi2 test for categorical data and t tests for continuous data  Results  Overall  1883 children and adolescents with newly diagnosed anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa  median  IQR  age  15 9  13 8-16 9  years  1713 female patients  91 0    were included  Prepandemic anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa diagnoses were stable over time  mean  SD   24 5  1 6  cases per month  beta coefficient  0 043  P    33   New diagnoses increased during the first wave of the pandemic to a mean  SD  of 40 6  20 1  cases per month with a steep upward trend  beta coefficient  5 97  P <  001   Similarly  hospitalizations for newly diagnosed patients increased from a mean  SD  of 7 5  2 8  to 20 0  9 8  cases per month  with a significant increase in linear trend  beta coefficient  -0 008 vs 3 23  P <  001   These trends were more pronounced in Canadian provinces with higher rates of COVID-19 infections  Markers of disease severity were worse among patients who were diagnosed during the first wave rather than before the pandemic  including more rapid progression  mean  SD   7 0  4 2  months vs 9 8  7 4  months  P <  001   greater mean  SD  weight loss  19 2   9 4   vs 17 5   9 6    P    01   and more profound bradycardia  mean  SD  heart rate  57  15 8  beats per minute vs 63  15 9  beats per minute  P <  001   Conclusions and Relevance  This cross-sectional study found a higher number of new diagnoses of and hospitalizations for anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa in children and adolescents during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada  Research is needed to better understand the drivers and prognosis for these patients and to prepare for their mental health needs in the event of future pandemics or prolonged social isolation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874405
9027,Introduction  Social isolation and loneliness  SI L  are growing problems with serious health implications for older adults  especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic  We examined transcripts from semi-structured interviews with 97 older adults  mean age 83 years  to identify linguistic features of SI L  Methods  Natural Language Processing  NLP  methods were used to identify relevant interview segments  responses to specific questions   extract the type and number of social contacts and linguistic features such as sentiment  parts-of-speech  and syntactic complexity  We examined   1  associations of NLP-derived assessments of social relationships and linguistic features with validated self-report assessments of social support and loneliness  and  2  important linguistic features for detecting individuals with higher level of SI L by using machine learning  ML  models  Results  NLP-derived assessments of social relationships were associated with self-reported assessments of social support and loneliness  though these associations were stronger in women than in men  Usage of first-person plural pronouns was negatively associated with loneliness in women and positively associated with emotional support in men  ML analysis using leave-one-out methodology showed good performance  F1   0 73  AUC   0 75  specificity   0 76  and sensitivity   0 69  of the binary classification models in detecting individuals with higher level of SI L  Comparable performance were also observed when classifying social and emotional support measures  Using ML models  we identified several linguistic features  including use of first-person plural pronouns  sentiment  sentence complexity  and sentence similarity  that most strongly predicted scores on scales for loneliness and social support  Discussion  Linguistic data can provide unique insights into SI L among older adults beyond scale-based assessments  though there are consistent gender differences  Future research studies that incorporate diverse linguistic features as well as other behavioral data-streams may be better able to capture the complexity of social functioning in older adults and identification of target subpopulations for future interventions  Given the novelty  use of NLP should include prospective consideration of bias  fairness  accountability  and related ethical and social implications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867518
4572,The recent coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has warranted the need to investigate potential therapies or prophylaxis against this infectious respiratory disease  There is emerging evidence about the potential role of nutrients on COVID-19 in addition to using medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin  This scoping review aims to explore the literature evaluating the effect of immunomodulatory nutrients on the outcomes including hospitalization  intensive care unit admission  oxygen requirement  and mortality in COVID-19 patients  A literature search of databases including Medline  EMBASE  CINAHL  Web of Science  Cochrane  Scopus  and PubMed  as well as hand-searching in Google Scholar  up to 10 February 2021  was conducted  All human studies with different study designs and without limitation on publication year were included except for non-English-language and review articles  Overall  out of 4412 studies  19 met our inclusion criteria  Four studies examined the impact of supplementation with vitamin C  4 studies - zinc  8 studies - vitamin D  and 3 studies investigated the combination of 2  zinc and vitamin C  or 3  vitamin D  vitamin B-12  and magnesium  nutrients  Although limited data exist  available evidence demonstrated that supplementation with immune-supportive micronutrients such as vitamins D and C and zinc may modulate immunity and alleviate the severity and risk of infection  The effectiveness of vitamin C  vitamin D  and zinc on COVID-19 was different based on baseline nutrient status  the duration and dosage of nutrient therapy  time of administration  and severity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  disease  This review indicated that supplementation with high-dose vitamin C  vitamin D  and zinc may alleviate the complications caused by COVID-19  including inflammatory markers  oxygen therapy  length of hospitalization  and mortality  however  studies were mixed regarding these effects  Further randomized clinical trials are necessary to identify the most effective nutrients and the safe dosage to combat SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932789
745,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  The COVID-19 pandemic required rapid adaptation of multidisciplinary tumor board conferences to a virtual setting  however  there are little data describing the benefits and challenges of using such a platform  METHODS  An anonymous quality improvement survey was sent to participants of tumor board meetings at a large academic institution  Participants answered questions pertaining to the relative strengths and weaknesses of in-person and virtual settings  RESULTS  A total of 335 responses  23 3  response rate  were recorded  and 253 met inclusion criteria  Respondents represented 25 different tumor board meetings  with colorectal  breast  and liver  18 6   17 0   and 13 0   respectively  being the most commonly attended  Virtual tumor boards were equivalent to in-person across 9 of 10 domains queried  while a virtual format was preferred for participation in off-site tumor boards  The lack of networking opportunities was ranked by physicians to be a significant challenge of the virtual format  Consistent leadership and organization  engaged participation of all attendees  and upgrading technology infrastructure were considered critical for success of virtual meetings  CONCLUSIONS  The implementation of virtual tumor board meetings has been associated with numerous challenges  However  improving several key aspects can improve participant satisfaction and ensure excellent patient care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994401
7228,OBJECTIVES  First  to describe SARS-CoV-2 T cell and antibody responses in a prospective cohort of healthcare workers that suffered from mild to moderate COVID-19 approximately one year ago  Second  to assess COVID-19 vaccine-induced immune responses in these prior-infected individuals  METHODS  SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD immunoglobulin G  IgG  responses in blood were determined before COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273  BNT162b2  Ad26 CoV2-S or ChAdOx1-S  two weeks after first vaccination  and after second vaccination  RESULTS  55 prior SARS-CoV-2 infected and seroconverted individuals were included  S1-specific T cell responses and anti-RBD IgG were detectable one year post SARS-CoV-2 infection  24 spot-forming cells per 10 6  peripheral blood mononuclear cells  SFCs 10 6  PBMCs  after S1 stimulation and anti-RBD IgG concentration of 74  IQR 36-158  IU mL  Responses after the first and second vaccination were comparable with S1-specfic T cell responses of 198  IQR 137-359  and 180  IQR 103-347  SFCs 10 6  PBMCs  and IgG concentrations of 6792  IQR 3386-15 180  and 6326  IQR 2336-13 440  IU mL  respectively  These responses retained up to four months after vaccination  CONCLUSIONS  Both T cell and IgG responses against SARS-CoV-2 persist for up to one year after COVID-19  A second COVID-19 vaccination in prior-infected individuals did not further increase immune responses in comparison to one vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896516

2865,Due to the severe impact of COVID-19 on public health  rollout of the vaccines must be large-scale  Current solutions are not intended to promote an active collaboration between communities and public health researchers  We aimed to develop a digital platform for communication between scientists and the general population  and to use it for an exploratory study on factors associated with vaccination readiness  The digital platform was developed in Latvia and was equipped with dynamic consent management  During a period of six weeks 467 participants were enrolled in the population-based cross-sectional exploratory study using this platform  We assessed demographics  COVID-19-related behavioral and personal factors  and reasons for vaccination  Logistic regression models adjusted for the level of education  anxiety  factors affecting the motivation to vaccinate  and risk of infection severe disease were built to investigate their association with vaccination readiness  In the fully adjusted multiple logistic regression model  factors associated with vaccination readiness were anxiety  odds ratio  OR   3 09  95  confidence interval 1 88  5 09    feelings of social responsibility  OR   1 61  1 16  2 22    and trust in pharmaceutical companies  OR   1 53  1 03  2 27    The assessment of a large number of participants in a six-week period show the potential of a digital platform to create a data-driven dialogue on vaccination readiness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960129
4657,The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is raising concerns because of its increased transmissibility and potential for reduced susceptibility to antibody neutralization  To assess the potential risk of this variant to existing vaccines  serum samples from mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients were tested for neutralizing activity against Omicron and compared to neutralization titers against D614G and Beta in a pseudovirus assay in two different laboratories  Omicron was 49-84-fold less sensitive to neutralization than D614G and 5 3-6 2-fold less sensitive than Beta when assayed with serum samples obtained 4 weeks after 2 standard inoculations with 100 mug mRNA-1273  A 50 mug boost increased Omicron neutralization titers and may substantially reduce the risk of symptomatic vaccine breakthrough infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931200
2268,We draw from conservation of resources theory to examine how employees  assessments of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  event strength may threaten their existing resources and their subsequent dependence on their supervisors  as well as voice behaviors that are critical to the organization s survival in a disruptive environment  We propose that assessments of COVID-19 as a strong event are positively related to employees  suffering  in turn increasing their sense of dependence on their supervisors and ultimately reducing their tendencies to display promotive and prohibitive voice  Furthermore  we propose that team compassion behavior can mitigate these negative indirect effects of COVID-19 event strength on employee voice by attenuating the positive effect of COVID-19 event strength on individual suffering  We designed a six-wave  multisource  time-lagged field study in a hotel chain based in a Southeast Asian country to capture employees  and supervisors  perceptions and behaviors before the onset of the pandemic  T1  and then following the country s COVID-19 mandatory stay-at-home order  T2-T6   Our results highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employee-supervisor relationships  and the critical role of team compassion behavior as a contextual moderator to reduce the indirect negative effect of COVID-19 event strength on employee voice   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968091
3290,BACKGROUND  Interferon-beta is an attractive drug for repurposing and use in the treatment of COVID-19  based on its in vitro antiviral activity and the encouraging results from clinical trials  The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of early interferon-beta treatment in patients admitted with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic  METHODS  This post hoc analysis of a COVID-19 Spain multicenter cohort included 3808 consecutive adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 1 January to 17 March 2020  The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality  and the main exposure of interest was subcutaneous administration of interferon-beta  defined as early if started <   3 days from admission  Multivariate logistic and Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the associations of different variables with receiving early interferon-beta therapy and to assess its impact on 30-day mortality  A propensity score was calculated and used to both control for confounders and perform a matched cohort analysis  RESULTS  Overall  683 patients  17 9   received early interferon-beta therapy  These patients were more severely ill  Adjusted HR for mortality with early interferon-beta was 1 03  95  CI  0 82-1 30  in the overall cohort  0 96  0 82-1 13  in the PS-matched subcohort  and 0 89  0 60-1 32  when interferon-beta treatment was analyzed as a time-dependent variable  CONCLUSIONS  In this multicenter cohort of admitted COVID-19 patients  receiving early interferon-beta therapy after hospital admission did not show an association with lower mortality  Whether interferon-beta might be useful in the earlier stages of the disease or specific subgroups of patients requires further research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954640
2516,Molnupiravir  MK-4482  is an investigational antiviral agent that is under development for the treatment of COVID-19  Given the potential high demand and urgency for this compound  it was critical to develop a short and sustainable synthesis from simple raw materials that would minimize the time needed to manufacture and supply molnupiravir  The route reported here is enabled through the invention of a novel biocatalytic cascade featuring an engineered ribosyl-1-kinase and uridine phosphorylase  These engineered enzymes were deployed with a pyruvate-oxidase-enabled phosphate recycling strategy  Compared to the initial route  this synthesis of molnupiravir is 70  shorter and approximately 7-fold higher yielding  Looking forward  the biocatalytic approach to molnupiravir outlined here is anticipated to have broad applications for streamlining the synthesis of nucleosides in general,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963891
5654,Objective  The present study investigates the seroconversion time course of the IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and ascertains whether its levels change according to the patient s ABO blood group  Method  A total of 36 003-convalescent plasma  CP  donations of 12 315 Turkish Red Crescent CP donors were analyzed  The ABO blood group of the CP donors was determined by Gel Centrifugation  and IgG was measured using the Euroimmun anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA  The differences in the distributions of mean IgG ratios among the different ABO blood groups were analyzed with One-Way ANOVA and Independent Samples T-test  Results  Among the CP donors  98 4  were male  An antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was noted-although in a few CP donors- on the 244th day  and a significant association between the ABO blood groups and the mean IgG ratios was noted  p  0 001   The highest  mean  -SD  antibody level was observed in the AB blood group  39 5  -15 7   followed by the B  37 9  -11 5  and the A blood groups  36 6  -10 7   while the lowest value was recorded in the O blood group  34 4  -11 5   Significant differences between all paired groups were noted in pairwise comparisons  The Rh  -  blood group  37 4  -13 6  had a significantly higher antibody level than the Rh     blood group  36 3  -11 2   p  0 005   Conclusion  An antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was noted in a CP donor on the 244th day  The average IgG ratios were higher in the CP donors with the AB blood group  but lower in the O blood group  These results may be considered a valuable indication of the effectiveness of CP therapy used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with clinically relevant blood types,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915675
2271,Controlling the pandemic has necessitated governments across the world to implement behavior change agenda  through new policies  laws  and public communication strategies  The concept of  psychological governance  has therefore been crucial to curtailing the pandemic  Psychological governance is the application of insights from behavioral and psychological sciences to public policy for the purpose of influencing behavior at the individual  group  and population levels  Similarly  a macropsychology perspective aims to understand and shape behavior at the population level  through the application of psychology to factors that influence the settings and conditions of our lives  such as policies  institutions  systems  and structures  Psychological governance and a macropsychology perspective are key to effectively supporting pandemic preparedness  coping  and recovery at the population level  In this paper  the role of psychological governance in responding to COVID-19 is considered  This paper also examines the role of several macropsychological factors in the pandemic  including heroism  trust in government  culture  and equitable access and human rights   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968088
9069,Introduction  There is strong evidence for the use of corticosteroid in the management of severe coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19   However  there is still uncertainty about the timing of corticosteroids  We undertook a modified Delphi study to develop expert consensus statements on the early identification of a subset of patients from non-severe COVID-19 who may benefit from using corticosteroids  Methods  A modified Delphi was conducted with two anonymous surveys between April 30  2021  and May 3  2021  An expert panel of 35 experts was selected and invited to participate through e-mail  The consensus was defined as >70  votes in multiple-choice questions  MCQ  on Likert-scale type statements  while strong consensus as >90  votes in MCQ or >50  votes for  very important  on Likert-scale questions in the final round  Results  Twenty experts completed two rounds of the survey  There was strong consensus for the increased work of breathing  95    a positive six-minute walk test  90    thorax computed tomography severity score of >14 25  85    new-onset organ dysfunction  using clinical or biochemical criteria   80    and C-reactive protein >5 times the upper limit of normal  70   as the criteria for patients  selection  The experts recommended using oral or intravenous  IV  low-dose corticosteroids  the equivalent of 6 mg day dexamethasone  for 5-10 days and monitoring of oxygen saturation  body temperature  clinical scoring system  blood sugar  and inflammatory markers for any  red-flag  signs  Conclusion  The experts recommended against indiscriminate use of corticosteroids in mild to moderate COVID-19 without the signs of clinical worsening  Oral or IV low-dose corticosteroids  the equivalent of 6 mg day dexamethasone  for 5-10 days are recommended for patients with features of disease progression based on clinical  biochemical  or radiological criteria after 5 days from symptom onset under close monitoring  How to cite this article  How to cite this article  Nasa P  Chaudhry D  Govil D  Daga MK  Jain R  Chhallani AA  et al  Expert Consensus Statements on the Use of Corticosteroids in Non-severe COVID-19  Indian J Crit Care Med 2021 25 11  1280-1285,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866826
6322,Evidence that patients may avoid healthcare facilities for fear of COVID-19 infection has heightened the concern that true rates of myocardial infarctions have been under-ascertained and left untreated  We analyzed data from the National Emergency Medical Services Information System  NEMSIS  and incident COVID-19 infections across the United States  US  between January 1  2020 and April 30  2020  Grouping events by US Census Division  multivariable adjusted negative binomial regression models were utilized to estimate the relationship between COVID-19 and EMS cardiovascular activations  After multivariable adjustment  increasing COVID-19 rates were associated with less activations for chest pain and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions  Simultaneously  increasing COVID-19 rates were associated with more activations for cardiac arrests  ventricular fibrillation  and ventricular tachycardia  Although direct effects of COVID-19 infections may explain these discordant observations  these findings may also arise from patients delaying or avoiding care for myocardial infarction  leading to potentially lethal consequences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907226
5026,The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the trial of novel treatment regimens to improve clinical outcomes  However  the liberal use of antibiotic and steroid therapy during this period may have also contributed to unintended consequences including the development of multidrug-resistant  MDR  bacterial infections  In this report  we discuss the case of a 76-year-old woman treated with an extended course of steroids for COVID-19 infection  The patient then developed MDR bacterial sinusitis requiring multiple courses of antibiotics complicated by medication side effects  Thus  this case highlights the continued importance of discretion in long-term steroid use and antibiotic stewardship,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926027
2935,BACKGROUND  Vaccination is an important preventive health measure to protect against symptomatic and severe COVID-19  Impaired immunity secondary to an underlying malignancy or recent receipt of anti-neoplastic systemic therapies can result in less robust antibody titres following vaccination and possible risk of breakthrough infection  As clinical trials evaluating COVID-19 vaccines largely excluded patients with a history of cancer and those on active immunosuppression  including chemotherapy   limited evidence is available to inform the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination across the spectrum of patients with cancer  PATIENTS AND METHODS  We describe the clinical features of patients with cancer who developed symptomatic COVID-19 following vaccination and compare weighted outcomes to those of contemporary unvaccinated patients  after adjustment for confounders  using data from the multi-institutional COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium  CCC19  ClinicalTrials gov number  NCT04354701   RESULTS  Patients with cancer who develop COVID-19 following vaccination have substantial comorbidities and can present with severe and even lethal infection  Patients harboring hematologic malignancies are over-represented among vaccinated patients with cancer who develop symptomatic COVID-19  CONCLUSIONS  Vaccination against COVID-19 remains an essential strategy in protecting vulnerable populations  including patients with cancer  However  patients with cancer who develop breakthrough infection despite full vaccination remain at risk of severe outcomes  A multilayered public health mitigation approach that includes vaccination of close contacts  boosters  social distancing  and mask-wearing should be continued for the foreseeable future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958894
3019,The novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is one of the biggest public health crises globally  Although Africa did not display the worst-case scenario compared to other continents  fears were still at its peak since Africa was already suffering from a heavy load of other life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV AIDS and malaria  Other factors that were anticipated to complicate Africa s outcomes include the lack of resources for diagnosis and contact tracing along with the low capacity of specialized management facilities per capita  The current review aims at assessing and generating discussions on the realities  and pros and cons of the WHO COVID-19 interim guidance 2020 5 considering the known peculiarities of the African continent  A comprehensive evaluation was done for COVID-19-related data published across PubMed and Google Scholar  date of the last search  August 17  2020  with emphasis on clinical management and psychosocial aspects  Predefined filters were then applied in data screening as detailed in the methods  Specifically  we interrogated the WHO 2020 5 guideline viz-a-viz health priority and health financing in Africa  COVID-19 case contact tracing and risk assessment  clinical management of COVID-19 cases as well as strategies for tackling stigmatization and psychosocial challenges encountered by COVID-19 survivors  The outcomes of this work provide links between these vital sub-themes which may impact the containment and management of COVID-19 cases in Africa in the long-term  The chief recommendation of the current study is the necessity of prudent filtration of the global findings along with regional modelling of the global care guidelines for acting properly in response to this health threat on the regional level without exposing our populations to further unnecessary adversities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957351
2486,Avidity is an effective and frequent phenomenon employed by nature to achieve extremely high-affinity interactions  As more drug discovery efforts aim to disrupt protein-protein interactions  it is becoming increasingly common to encounter systems that utilize avidity effects and to study these systems using surface-based technologies  such as surface plasmon resonance  SPR  or biolayer interferometry  However  heterogeneity introduced from multivalent binding interactions complicates the analysis of the resulting sensorgram  A frequently applied practice is to fit the data based on a 1 1 binding model  and if the fit does not describe the data adequately  then the experimental setup is changed to favor a 1 1 binding interaction  This reductionistic approach is informative but not always biologically relevant  Therefore  we aimed to develop an SPR-based assay that would reduce the heterogeneity to enable the determination of the kinetic rate constants for multivalent binding interactions using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  spike protein and the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  as a model system  We employed a combinatorial approach to generate a sensor surface that could distinguish between monovalent and multivalent interactions  Using advanced data analysis algorithms to analyze the resulting sensorgrams  we found that controlling the surface heterogeneity enabled the deconvolution of the avidity-induced affinity enhancement for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 interaction,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964599

1962,OBJECTIVES  Patients with COVID-19 frequently develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  requiring intensive care unit  ICU  admission  Data on long-term survival of these patients are lacking  The authors investigated 1-year survival  quality of life  and functional recovery of patients with COVID-19 ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation  DESIGN  Prospective observational study  SETTING  Tertiary-care university hospital  PARTICIPANTS  All patients with COVID-19 ARDS receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and discharged alive from hospital  INTERVENTIONS  Patients were contacted by phone after 1 year  Functional  cognitive  and psychological outcomes were explored through a questionnaire and assessed using validated scales  Patients were offered the possibility to undergo a follow-up chest computed tomography  CT  scan  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS  The study included all adult  age >  18 years  patients with COVID-19-related ARDS admitted to an ICU of the authors  institution between February 25  2020  and April 27  2020  who received at least 1 day of invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   Of 116 patients who received IMV  61  52 6   survived to hospital discharge  These survivors were assessed 1 year after discharge and 56 completed a battery of tests of cognition  activities of daily living  and interaction with family members  They had overall good functional recovery  with >80  reporting good recovery and no difficulties in usual activities  A total of 52  93   of patients had no dyspnea at rest  Severe anxiety depression was reported by 5  8 9   patients  Comparing 2-month and 1-year data  the authors observed the most significant improvements in the areas of working status and exertional dyspnea  One-year chest CT scans were available for 36 patients  fibrotic-like changes were present in 4 patients  CONCLUSIONS  All patients who survived the acute phase of COVID-19 and were discharged from the hospital were alive at the 1-year follow up  and the vast majority of them had good overall recovery and quality of life,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973891
5605,INTRODUCTION  Increased age has been reported to be a factor for COVID-19 severe outcomes  However  many studies do not consider the age dependency of comorbidities  which influence the course of disease  Protection strategies often target individuals after a certain age  which may not necessarily be evidence based  The aim of this review was to quantify the isolated effect of age on hospitalisation  admission to intensive care unit  ICU   mechanical ventilation and death  METHODS  This review was based on an umbrella review  in which Pubmed  Embase and preprint databases were searched on 10 December 2020  for relevant reviews on COVID-19 disease severity  Two independent reviewers evaluated the primary studies using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria  The results were extracted  and each study was assessed for risk of bias  The isolated effect of age was estimated by meta-analysis  and the quality of evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendations  Assessment  Development  and Evaluation framework  RESULTS  Seventy studies met our inclusion criteria  case mortality  n 14  in-hospital mortality  n 44  hospitalisation  n 16  admission to ICU  n 12  mechanical ventilation  n 7   The risk of in-hospital and case mortality increased per age year by 5 7  and 7 4   respectively  effect size  ES  in-hospital mortality 1 057  95  CI 1 038 to 1 054  ES case mortality 1 074  95  CI 1 061 to 1 087   while the risk of hospitalisation increased by 3 4  per age year  ES 1 034  95  CI 1 021 to 1 048   No increased risk was observed for ICU admission and intubation by age year  There was no evidence of a specific age threshold at which the risk accelerates considerably  The confidence of evidence was high for mortality and hospitalisation  CONCLUSIONS  Our results show a best-possible quantification of the increase in COVID-19 disease severity due to age  Rather than implementing age thresholds  prevention programmes should consider the continuous increase in risk  There is a need for continuous  high-quality research and  living  reviews to evaluate the evidence throughout the pandemic  as results may change due to varying circumstances,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916273
9618,Rationale  We aimed to predict the presence of vaccine-induced hypermetabolic lymph nodes  v-HLN  on  18 F-FDG PET CT after Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccination and determine their association with lymphocyte counts  Methods  In this retrospective single-center study  we included consecutive patients who underwent   18 F -FDG PET CT imaging after mRNA- or viral vector-based COVID-19 vaccination between early March and late April 2021  Demographic  clinical parameters and absolute lymphocyte count  ALC  were collected and their association with the presence of v-HLN in the draining territory was studied by logistic regression  Results  Two hundred and sixty patients were eligible  including 209  80   women and 145  56   with breast cancer  The median age was 50 years  range  23-96   Two hundred thirty-three patients  90   received the mRNA vaccine  Ninety  35   patients had v-HLN with a median SUVmax of 3 7  range  2 0-26 3  and 74  44   displayed lymphopenia with a median ALC of 1 4 G L  range  0 3-18 3   Age <   50 years  odds ratio  OR  2 2  95 CI 1 0-4 5   the absence of lymphopenia  OR 2 2  95 CI 1 1-4 3  and the delay from the last vaccine injection to the date of   18 F -FDG PET CT  if < 30 days  OR 2 6  95 CI 1 3-5 6   were independent factors for v-HLN in multivariate analysis  In breast cancer patients  the absence of lymphopenia was the only independent factor significantly associated with v-HLN  OR 2 9  95 CI 1 2-7 4   Conclusion  Patients with normal values of ALC after COVID-19 vaccine were more likely to have v-HLN on   18 F -FDG PET CT  which might both be associated to a stronger immune response to vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857663
8371,OBJECTIVE  The COVID-19 pandemic led Spain to order a state of alert with the cessation of non-essential activities on 14 March 2020  and to implement public health interventions  such as home confinement  and other health recommendations to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus  hand washing and the obligation to wear face-masks   These factors could have influenced the rate of viral conjunctivitis  METHODS  In this retrospective  noninterventional  descriptive study  the incidence of viral conjunctivitis in an emergency department of a national hospital is compared over two distinct time periods  pre-COVID  13 March-30 September 2019  one year before the start of the pandemic  and COVID  13 March-30 September 2020   RESULTS  In the first period there were 436 cases of conjunctivitis  of which 168  38 5   were confirmed cases of viral conjunctivitis 168  38 5    while in the second period there were 121 recorded cases  of which the most frequent were allergic and traumatic  23 cases  19  each group   bacterial  15 cases  12 3   and viral  15 cases  12 3    The diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis is the one that suffered the most significant relative reduction  48 5    while other types of conjunctivitis hardly changed their relative frequency between these two periods of time  CONCLUSIONS  Viral conjunctivitis is the most frequent infectious disease of the eye and has a transmission rate similar to that of coronavirus  so the measures implemented could positively affect its incidence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876775
8438,The most common symptoms in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are fever  cough  odynophagia  headache  myalgia  and diarrhea  A much smaller percentage have dizziness  rhinorrhea  and hemoptysis as associated symptoms  However  the great magnitude that this second wave acquired  can make this last complication appear more frequently  This report describes the case of a 49-year-old patient with a history of recent COVID-19 infection with requirement of mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure  who developed during hospitalization in the general ward with parapneumonic pleural effusion and episodes of persistent hemoptysis that required surgical treatment  During surgery  a significant fibro-adhesion process and a congestive lung with focal increased consistency and areas of necrosis were found,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875605
3353,There is need for new effective antivirals  particularly in response to the development of antiviral drug resistance and emerging RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2  Plants are a significant source of structurally diverse bioactive compounds for drug discovery suggesting that plant-derived natural products could be developed as antiviral agents  This article reviews the antiviral activity of plant-derived natural products against RNA viruses  with a focus on compounds targeting specific stages of the viral life cycle  A range of plant extracts and compounds have been identified with antiviral activity  often against multiple virus families suggesting they may be useful as broad-spectrum antiviral agents  The antiviral mechanism of action of many of these phytochemicals is not fully understood and there are limited studies and clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy and toxicity in vivo  Further research is needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of plant-derived natural products as antiviral agents,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953146
7213,BACKGROUND  As a result of the decrease in socialization levels in computer-supported collaborative learning settings and or interactions in social environments during the Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  the adverse influence on the social intelligence development of nursing students could trigger loneliness  OBJECTIVES  The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of perceived sociability and social intelligence on loneliness in online learning among nursing students in Turkey  DESIGN  Descriptive  correlational and predictive study  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS  A total of 246 nursing students in the Nursing Department of a state university in the Istanbul province of Turkey were included  METHODS  Data were collected using the Participant Information Form  Sociability Scale  UCLA Loneliness Scale-8  ULS-8  for the Adolescents  and Tromso Social Intelligence Scale  TSIS  between November 2020 and December 2020  A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of loneliness  A p value of <0 05 was considered statistically significant  RESULTS  The total mean Sociability Scale score was 23 54   - 7 51  range  10-46   The total mean TSIS score was 74 15   - 9 98  range  46-105  and the total mean ULS-8 was 13 91   - 4 98  range  7-27   Perceived sociability in online learning  beta   -0 321  p <  001   and social intelligence  beta   -0 347  p <  001  were significant negative predictors  R 2    0 269  p <  001  of loneliness  CONCLUSION  Perceived sociability in online learning and social intelligence was associated with the level of loneliness of this population during online learning,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896849
7272,BACKGR1OUND  Widespread vaccine hesitancy and refusal complicate containment of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  Extant research indicates that biased reasoning and conspiracist ideation discourage vaccination  However  causal pathways from these constructs to vaccine hesitancy and refusal remain underspecified  impeding efforts to intervene and increase vaccine uptake  METHOD  554 participants who denied prior SARS-CoV-2 vaccination completed self-report measures of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions  conspiracist ideation  and constructs from the Health Belief Model of medical decision-making  such as perceived vaccine dangerousness  along with tasks measuring reasoning biases  such as those concerning data gathering behavior   Cutting-edge machine learning algorithms  Greedy Fast Causal Inference  and psychometric network analysis were used to elucidate causal pathways to  and from  vaccine intentions  RESULTS  Results indicated that a bias toward reduced data gathering during reasoning may cause paranoia  increasing the perceived dangerousness of vaccines and thereby reducing willingness to vaccinate  Existing interventions that target data gathering and paranoia therefore hold promise for encouraging vaccination  Additionally  reduced willingness to vaccinate was identified as a likely cause of belief in conspiracy theories  subverting the common assumption that the opposite causal relation exists  Finally  perceived severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and perceived vaccine dangerousness  but not effectiveness  were potential direct causes of willingness to vaccinate  providing partial support for the Health Belief Model s applicability to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine decisions  CONCLUSIONS  These insights significantly advance our understanding of the underpinnings of vaccine intentions and should scaffold efforts to prepare more effective interventions on hesitancy for deployment during future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895784
211,SARS-CoV-2 has had a serious impact on the world  In this study  small RNAs from the blood of COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe symptoms were extracted for high-throughput sequencing and analysis  Interestingly  the levels of a special group of tRNA-derived small RNAs  tsRNAs  were found to be dramatically upregulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection  particularly in COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms  In particular  the 3 CCA tsRNAs from Gly-tRNA were highly consistent with the inflammation indicator C-reactive protein  CRP   In addition  we found that the majority of significantly changed microRNAs  miRNAs  were associated with endoplasmic reticulum  ER  unfolded protein response  UPR  sensors  which may lead to the induction of proinflammatory cytokine and immune responses  This study found that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused significant changes in the levels of stress-associated small RNAs in patient blood and their potential functions  Our research revealed that the cells of COVID-19 patients undergo tremendous stress and respond  which can be reflected or regulated by sncRNAs  thus providing potential thought for therapeutic intervention in COVID-19 by modulating small RNA levels or activities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003892
9579,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic forced most Italian athletes to cease their regular training activities  with possible consequences on both mental and physical health  The present study aimed at assessing changes in Physical Activity  PA  from pre- to lockdown  and examining the relationships among lockdown PA  quality of life  mental and physical health   motivation to exercise  psychological distress  intolerance of uncertainty  and body dissatisfaction  Methods  A total of 204 athletes of different sports  91 elite  110 females  mean age   22 55  SD   5 76  answered an online survey investigating demographics  sport-related questions  PA  IPAQ-S   quality of life  SF-12   and psychological variables  BREQ-2  DASS-21  IUS-R  and EDI-3-Body dissatisfaction subscale   Results  Both elite and non-elite athletes significantly reduced their PA intensity and volume  p < 0 001   Elite athletes did not differ from non-elite in terms of total PA intensity and hours of training during lockdown  p > 0 05   Elite and individual athletes showed higher intrinsic motivation to exercise compared to non-elite and team sports  p < 0 01   Female athletes displayed higher distress  worse mental health  and higher body dissatisfaction than males  p < 0 05   Mediation models showed that vigorous PA positively affected both mental  p < 0 05  and physical  p < 0 001  health during lockdown  independently of distress and intolerance of uncertainty  Conclusion  The COVID-19 lockdown was taxing for athletes  particularly professionals  those who were able to practice PA at high intensity during lockdown reported better mental and physical health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858284
1396,The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan was successfully curbed under the strategy of  Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism   To understand how this measure stopped the epidemics in Wuhan  we establish a compartmental model with time-varying parameters over different stages  In the early stage of the epidemic  due to resource limitations  the number of daily reported cases may lower than the actual number  We employ a dynamic-based approach to calibrate the accumulated clinically diagnosed data with a sudden jump on February 12 and 13  The model simulation shows reasonably good match with the adjusted data which allows the prediction of the cumulative confirmed cases  Numerical results reveal that the  Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism  played a significant role on the containment of COVID-19  The spread of COVID-19 cannot be inhibited if any of the measures was not effectively implemented  Our analysis also illustrates that the Fangcang Shelter Hospitals are very helpful when the beds in the designated hospitals are insufficient  Comprised with Fangcang Shelter Hospitals  the designated hospitals can contain the transmission of COVID-19 more effectively  Our findings suggest that the combined multiple measures are essential to curb an ongoing epidemic if the prevention and control measures can be fully implemented,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982256
2446,Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent  With the rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  globally  remdesivir is taking the spotlight for COVID-19 treatment  Despite the promising signs of anti-CoV activity in several preclinical and clinical studies  more data of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 is still needed for evaluating its efficacy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965372
4229,Phenoptosis is a programmed death that has emerged in the process of evolution  sometimes taking the form of an altruistic program  In particular  it is believed to be a weapon against the spread of pandemics in the past and an obstacle in fighting pandemics in the present  COVID   However  on the evolutionary scale  deterministic death is not associated with random relationships  for example  bacteria with a particular mutation   but is a product of higher nervous activity or a consequence of established hierarchy that reaches its maximal expression in eusocial communities of Hymenoptera and highly social communities of mammals  Unlike a simple association of individuals  eusociality is characterized by the appearance of non-reproductive individuals as the highest form of altruism  In contrast to primitive programs for unicellular organisms  higher multicellular organisms are characterized by the development of behavior-based phenoptotic programs  especially in the case of reproduction-associated limitation of lifespan  Therefore  we can say that the development of altruism in the course of evolution of sociality leads in its extreme manifestation to phenoptosis  Development of mathematical models for the emergence of altruism and programmed death contributes to our understanding of mechanisms underlying these paradoxical counterproductive  harmful  programs  In theory  this model can be applied not only to insects  but also to other social animals and even to the human society  Adaptive death is an extreme form of altruism  We consider altruism and programmed death as programmed processes in the mechanistic and adaptive sense  respectively  Mechanistically  this is a program existing as a predetermined chain of certain responses  regardless of its adaptive value  As to its adaptive value  regardless of the degree of  phenoptoticity    this is a characteristic of organisms that demonstrate high levels of kinship  social organization  and physical association typical for higher-order individuals  e g   unicellular organisms forming colonies with some characteristics of multicellular animals or colonies of multicellular animals displaying features of supraorganisms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937533
217,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to health systems worldwide-in delivering care to patients and in maintaining training of their care providers  Surgical specialties have particularly struggled to maintain sufficient levels of training as we have seen significant reductions in the number of surgical beds  operating lists and redeployment of surgical staff to COVID-19 departments or Intensive Treatment Units  METHODS  Comparison of the number of surgical operations performed between January 1st 2019 and December 31st 2020 in 3 surgical departments in Romania  Craiova  Timisoara and Bucharest  and 1 surgical department in Thessaloniki  Greece  Cases were compared on a month to month basis  both elective and emergency operations were included and divided into three main categories based on severity  Minor  Medium  Major   RESULTS  Between 2019 and 2020  there was a 37 04  decrease in the number of surgical procedures  36 95  for open procedures and 37 20  for laparoscopic procedures  Statistically significant overall reduction was observed in all three centers for both open and laparoscopic operations  In all centers  a statistically significant reduction in medium severity procedures was also observed  CONCLUSION  Globally felt detrimental effect on surgical training  patient contact and mental well-being reflected similarly across surgical specialties in both countries,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003779
1427,AIM  To identify clinical and laboratory parameters that can assist in the differential diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   influenza  and respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  infections  METHODS  In this retrospective cohort study  we obtained basic demographics and laboratory data from all 685 hospitalized patients confirmed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   influenza virus  or RSV from 2018 to 2020  A multiple logistic regression was employed to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 and laboratory parameters  RESULTS  SARS-CoV-2 patients were significantly younger than RSV  P 0 001  and influenza virus  P 0 022  patients  SARS-CoV-2 patients also displayed a significant male predominance over influenza virus patients  P 0 047   They also had significantly lower white blood cell count  median 6 3x106 cells mu  compared with influenza virus  P<0 001  and RSV  P 0 001  patients  Differences were also observed in other laboratory values but were insignificant in a multivariate analysis  CONCLUSIONS  Male sex  younger age  and low white blood cell count can assist in the diagnosis of COVID-19 over other viral infections  However  the differences between the groups were not substantial enough and would probably not suffice to distinguish between the viral illnesses in the emergency department,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981695
1670,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased usage of ethanol-based disinfectants for surface inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in buildings  Emissions of volatile organic compounds  VOCs  and particles from ethanol-based disinfectant sprays were characterized in real-time  1 Hz  via a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer  PTR-TOF-MS  and a high-resolution electrical low-pressure impactor  HR-ELPI    respectively  Ethanol-based disinfectants drove sudden changes in the chemical composition of indoor air  VOC and particle concentrations increased immediately after application of the disinfectants  remained elevated during surface contact time  and gradually decreased after wiping  The disinfectants produced a broad spectrum of VOCs with mixing ratios spanning the sub-ppb to ppm range  Ethanol was the dominant VOC emitted by mass  with concentrations exceeding 10 3  mug m -3  and emission factors ranging from 10 1  to 10 2  mg g -1   Listed and unlisted diols  monoterpenes  and monoterpenoids were also abundant  The pressurized sprays released significant quantities  10 4 -10 5  cm -3   of nano-sized particles smaller than 100 nm  resulting in large deposited doses in the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the respiratory system  Inhalation exposure to VOCs varied with time during the building disinfection events  Much of the VOC inhalation intake  >60    occurred after the disinfectant was sprayed and wiped off the surface  Routine building disinfection with ethanol-based sprays during the COVID-19 pandemic may present a human health risk given the elevated production of volatile chemicals and nano-sized particles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977843

3123,To evaluate the role of common substrates in the transmission of respiratory viruses  in particular SARS-CoV-2  uniformly distributed microdroplets  approx  10 microm diameter  of artificial saliva were generated using an advanced inkjet printing technology to replicate the aerosol droplets and subsequently deposited on five substrates  including glass  polytetrafluoroethylene  stainless steel  acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and melamine  The droplets were found to evaporate within a short timeframe  less than 3 s   which is consistent with previous reports concerning the drying kinetics of picolitre droplets  Using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy  we found that the surface deposited microdroplet nuclei present two distinctive morphological features as the result of their drying mode  which is controlled by both interfacial energy and surface roughness  Nanomechanical measurements confirm that the nuclei deposited on all substrates possess similar surface adhesion  approx  20 nN  and Young s modulus  approx  4 MPa   supporting the proposed core-shell structure of the nuclei  We suggest that appropriate antiviral surface strategies  e g  functionalization  chemical deposition  could be developed to modulate the evaporation process of microdroplet nuclei and subsequently mitigate the possible surface viability and transmissibility of respiratory virus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956611
8109,Clinical case reports circulate relevant information regarding disease presentation and describe treatment protocols  particularly for novel conditions  In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic  case reports provided key insights into the pathophysiology and sequelae associated with Covid-19 infection and described treatment mechanisms and outcomes  However  case reports are often subject to selection bias due to their singular nature  To better understand how selection biases may have influenced Covid-19-releated case reports  we conducted a bibliometric analysis of Covid-19-releated case reports published in high impact journals from January 1 to June 1  2020  Case reports were coded for patient sex  country of institutional affiliation  physiological system  and first and last author gender  Of 494 total case reports  45   n   221  of patients were male  30   n   146  were female  and 25   n   124  included both sexes  Ratios of male-only to female-only case reports varied by physiological system  The majority of case reports had male first  61   n   302  and last  70   n   340  authors  Case reports with male last authors were more likely to describe male patients  X  2   2  n   465    6 6  p   0 037   while case reports with female last authors were more likely to include patients of both sexes  OR   1 918  95  CI   1 163-3 16    Despite a limited sample size  these data reflect emerging research on sex-differences in the physiological presentation and impact of Covid-19 and parallel large-scale trends in authorship patterns  Ultimately  this work highlights potential biases in the dissemination of clinical information via case reports and underscores the inextricable influences of sex and gender biases within biomedicine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881381
6250,This study quantifies the effect of the 2020 state COVID economic activity reopening policies on daily mobility and mixing behavior  adding to the economic literature on individual responses to public health policy that addresses public contagion risks  We harness cellular device signal data and the timing of reopening plans to provide an assessment of the extent to which human mobility and physical proximity in the United States respond to the reversal of state closure policies  We observe substantial increases in mixing activities  13 56  at 4 days and 48 65  at 4 weeks  following reopening events  Echoing a theme from the literature on the 2020 closures  mobility outside the home increased on average prior to these state actions  Furthermore  the largest increases in mobility occurred in states that were early adopters of closure measures and hard-hit by the pandemic  suggesting that psychological fatigue is an important barrier to implementation of closure policies extending for prolonged periods of time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908602

2129,Twenty months into the COVID-19 pandemic  we are still learning about the various long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection  While many patients do recover with minimal long-term consequences  some patients develop irreversible parenchymal and interstitial lung damage leading to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis  Unfortunately  these are some of the consequences of post-SARS-CoV-2 infection which thousands more people around the world will experience and which will outlast the pandemic for a long time to come  It is now being observed at various leading medical centres around the world that lung transplantation may be the only meaningful treatment available to a select group of patients experiencing serious lung damage and non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure  resulting from the triad of coronavirus infection  a hyper-inflammatory immune response to it and the inability of the human body to repair that injury,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970411
2107,BACKGROUND  Overactivation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3  NLRP3  inflammasome can lead to severe illness in patients with coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19   The NLRP3 inhibitor  colchicine  therefore  appears to be promising for the treatment of COVID-19  AIMS  We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of randomized trials investigating the effect of colchicine in patients with COVID-19  MATERIALS   METHODS  We systematically searched electronic databases and clinical trial registries  up to October 17  2021  for eligible studies  The outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and duration of hospital stay  Meta-analysis with the random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled odds ratio  OR  of mortality and 95  confidence interval  CI   The pooled standardized mean difference of duration of hospital stay with 95  CI between colchicine users and non-colchicine users was estimated using Cohen s d index  RESULTS  The meta-analyses revealed no significant difference in the odds of mortality  pooled OR   0 76  95  CI  0 53-1 07   but a significant reduction in the duration of hospital stay with the use of colchicine  pooled standardized mean difference   -0 59  95  CI  -1 06 to -0 13   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  The ability of colchicine to reduce the length of stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is consistent with its potential to prevent clinical deterioration via inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome  Nevertheless  such beneficial effects of colchicine did not translate into mortality benefits in patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970856
3208,The spread of COVID-19 and ensuing containment measures have accentuated the profound interdependence among nations or regions  This has been particularly evident in tourism  one of the sectors most affected by uncoordinated mobility restrictions  The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate  more so if diversity in economic exposures to citizens  mobility are considered  Here  we address this problem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic effects of global risks  such as in the COVID-19 pandemic  The model includes the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments  including the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved in the game  By using tourism-based data  the model is enriched with actual heterogeneous income losses  such that every player has a different economic cost when applying restrictions  We show that economic interdependence enhances cooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding parties  i e   those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions   Furthermore  we show  analytically and through numerical simulations  that these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each region or country faces  modifying the position of the fixed points and the size of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games  Finally  our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the most relevant initial set of cooperators,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955615
1317,BACKGROUND  Healthy aging with dignity and aging in place are important for Taiwanese individuals  Although Taiwan did not experience COVID-19 outbreaks prior to May 2021  many older adults have been encouraged to stay at home since the beginning of the global pandemic in January 2020  Such shelter-in-place recommendations have resulted in significant lifestyle changes  limiting activities associated with aging with dignity such as exercise and community engagement  Few studies have explored how to promote or maintain holistic health practices and physical fitness in older adults residing in rural communities during the COVID-19 pandemic  This pilot study aimed to establish an interdisciplinary collaboration with community care workers  CCWs  and evaluate the impact of an innovative summer camp  ISC  program for older adults residing in rural areas  METHODS  A quasi-experimental pre-post-test design with an interdisciplinary collaborative approach was implemented  The ISC program was based on a standardized protocol of modified Baduanjin exercise combined with three recreational breathing games  Participants were recruited from three community centers around the western coastal region of Yunlin County between June and August 2020  The ISC program was designed and executed by a nurse-led health promotion research team that collaborated with trained CCWs for 90 min per day  five days per week  for 12 weeks  Participants and CCWs wore facemasks during all activities  Paired t-test was used to measure changes in physical biomarkers  pulmonary lung function  and health-related fitness changes  RESULTS  Sixty-eight participants completed the ISC program  The ISC program significantly improved the participants  physiological biomarkers and health-related fitness  including reduced body weight  waistline  and systolic blood pressure  and increased forced vital capacity  biceps arm flexion  and ability to sit and stand from a chair  step with a knee up in situ  and stand on one foot with eyes open  Most participants reported that they felt happy  satisfied  and hoped that this program would be continued in their community center  CONCLUSIONS  This interdisciplinary  collaborative ISC program improved physical biomarkers and health-related fitness in older adults  Despite limitations  results strongly suggested that primary healthcare providers and CCWs can employ the described ISC program to promote wellness in older adults,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983513
1302,18 F-FDG PET CT plays an increasingly pivotal role in the staging and post-treatment monitoring of high-risk melanoma patients  augmented by the introduction of therapies  including tyrosine kinase inhibitors  TKI  and immune checkpoint inhibitors  ICIs   that have novel modes of action that challenge conventional response assessment  Simultaneously  technological advances have been regularly released  including advanced reconstruction algorithms  digital PET and motion correction  which have allowed the PET community to detect ever-smaller cancer lesions  improving diagnostic performance in the context of indications previously viewed as limitations  such as detection of in-transit disease and confirmation of the nature of small pulmonary metastases apparent on CT This review will provide advice regarding melanoma-related PET protocols and will focus on variants encountered during the imaging of melanoma patients  Emphasis will be made on pitfalls related to non-malignant diseases and treatment-related findings that may confound accurate interpretation unless recognized  The latter include signs of immune activation and immune-related adverse events  irAEs   Technology-related pitfalls are also discussed  since while new PET technologies improve detection of small lesions  these may also induce false-positive cases and require a learning curve to be observed  In these times of the COVID 19 pandemic  cases illustrating lessons learned from COVID 19 or vaccination-related pitfalls will also be described,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983677
5851,Objectives  Vaccinations work with different mechanisms to offer protection against disease  however  process of immunity building can cause symptoms  Therefore  this study aimed to determine the immediate side effects of COVID-19 vaccination in the Pakistani Population  Methods  This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at Foundation University College of Dentistry  Islamabad from February to April 2021  0 5 mL per dose of the Covid-19 vaccine was administered to the candidates  These 205 candidates receiving vaccination were then interviewed investigating the adverse effects of the vaccine  Post-vaccination side effects were compared among categorical groups using the Chi-Square test  whereas post-vaccination side effects were compared with age using independent samples T-test  A p-value of <  0 05 was statistically significant  Results  Among post-vaccination side effects  fever was reported by 69 participants  while 56 of 205 reported soreness  redness  and swelling at the injection site  It was reported by 42 205 participants to have felt chills and rigor  whereas gastrointestinal disturbance and flu-like symptoms were reported in 55 205 and 28 205 participants  respectively  Younger participants were more likely to develop gastrointestinal disturbance and flu-like symptoms following vaccination as compared to older participants  Conclusion  Malaise  headache  and fever were observed to be the most common side effects of the vaccine  moreover there was a linear relationship between manifestations of adverse effects and history of comorbidities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912426
4862,Several applications in health diagnostics  food  safety  and environmental monitoring require rapid  simple  selective  and quantitatively accurate viral load monitoring  Here  we introduce the first label-free biosensing method that rapidly detects and quantifies intact virus in human saliva with single-virion resolution  Using pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 as a representative target  we immobilize aptamers with the ability to differentiate active from inactive virions on a photonic crystal  where the virions are captured through affinity with the spike protein displayed on the outer surface  Once captured  the intrinsic scattering of the virions is amplified and detected through interferometric imaging  Our approach analyzes the motion trajectory of each captured virion  enabling highly selective recognition against nontarget virions  while providing a limit of detection of 1 x 10 3  copies mL at room temperature  The approach offers an alternative to enzymatic amplification assays for point-of-collection diagnostics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928591
7047,Employees around the globe experience manifold challenges to maintain job performance during the so-called work-from-home experiment caused by the COVID-19 crisis  Whereas the self-control literature suggests that higher trait self-control should enable employees to deal with these demands more effectively  we know little about the underlying mechanisms  In a mixed-methods approach and two waves of data collection  we examine how self-control strategies elucidate the link between teleworking employees  trait self-control and their job performance  Using a qualitative approach  we explored which strategies employees use to telework effectively  N   266   In line with the process model of self-control  reported strategies pertained to situation modification  i e   altering the physical  somatic  or social conditions  and cognitive change  i e   goal setting  planning scheduling  and autonomous motivation   Subsequent preregistered  quantitative analyses with a diverse sample of 106 teleworkers corroborated that higher trait self-control is related to job performance beyond situational demands and prior performance  Among all self-control strategies  modifying somatic conditions and autonomous motivation was significantly associated with job performance and mediated the self-control-performance link  This research provides novel insights into the processes by which employees productively work from home and inspires a broad er  view on the topic of self-control at work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898804
12,Adeno-associated virus  AAV -mediated gene delivery holds great promise for gene therapy  However  the non-invasive delivery of AAV for lung tissues has not been adequately established  Here  we revealed that the intratracheal administration of an appropriate amount of AAV2 8 predominantly targets lung tissue  AAV-mediated gene delivery that we used in this study induced the expression of the desired protein in lung parenchymal cells  including alveolar type II cells  We harnessed the technique to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2 -susceptible mice  Three kinds of immune function-relevant gene knockout  KO  mice were transduced with AAV encoding human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  hACE2  and then injected with SARS-CoV-2  Among these mice  type I interferon receptor  IFNAR  KO mice showed increased viral titer in the lungs compared to that in the other KO mice  Moreover  nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 and multiple lesions in the trachea and lung were observed in AAV-hACE2-transduced  SARS-CoV-2-infected IFNAR KO mice  indicating the involvement of type I interferon signaling in the protection of SARS-CoV-2  In this study  we demonstrate the ease and rapidness of the intratracheal administration of AAV for targeting lung tissue in mice and this can be potentially used to study diverse pulmonary diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007757
5572,Purpose  This study aims to gauge the perception and adoption rates of telemedicine amongst patients with non-communicable diseases  NCD  as opposed to in-person consultations in a quaternary care center in South India  Patients and Methods  A web-hosted 21-item cross-sectional survey was distributed to 220 randomly selected patients with a routine appointment in one of the seven departments caring for NCDs in the study center  Descriptive analysis and inferential analyses were done  Paired samples T-test and Pearson s Chi-square test were used study associations  Results  In-person consultations decreased by 1 9  -4 47 visits per year  in 2020 vs 2019  Most participants reported  fear of COVID-19  as the primary reason for this decline  Participants also reported that their consultation times had significantly decreased  OR 6 43  95  CI 1 7-24 08  p 0 006   The decreased consultations time  difficulty in obtaining in-person appointments  along with the reduced physical examination during consultations have made participants more open to the idea of teleconsultations  OR 3 88  95  CI 1 21-12 47  p 0 022   Eighty-five  38 63   participants had already adopted telemedicine for their routine consultations during the pandemic  Whilst participants felt that telemedicine was an adequate surrogate for in-person consultations  a significant difficulty in obtaining medications was noted  OR 6  95  CI 1 34-26 81  p 0 019   Conclusion  In-person consultations were decreased primarily due to the perception of significant risk of COVID-19 exposure in the present scenario  Telemedicine adoption in the private sector may be sustainable throughout the pandemic and beyond  if patients are offered to continue their routine consultations with their regular doctors and ensured medicine availability  Integration of telemedicine by the public and private health sector of India into routine NCD care delivery is the need of the hour  but further studies are required to estimate the effectiveness of the systems,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916781
4712,Identifying which children and young people  CYP  are most vulnerable to serious infection due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is important to guide protective interventions  To address this question  we used data for all hospitalizations in England among 0-17 year olds from 1 February 2019 to 31 January 2021  We examined how sociodemographic factors and comorbidities might be risk factors for pediatric intensive care unit  PICU  admission among hospitalizations due to the following causes  Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  and pediatric inflammatory multi-system syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2  PIMS-TS  in the first pandemic year  2020-2021   hospitalizations due to all other non-traumatic causes in 2020-2021  hospitalizations due to all non-traumatic causes in 2019-2020  and hospitalizations due to influenza in 2019-2020  Risk of PICU admission and death from COVID-19 or PIMS-TS in CYP was very low  We identified 6 338 hospitalizations with COVID-19  of which 259 were admitted to a PICU and eight CYP died  We identified 712 hospitalizations with PIMS-TS  of which 312 were admitted to a PICU and fewer than five CYP died  Hospitalizations with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS were more common among males  older CYP  those from socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods and those who were of non-White ethnicity  Black  Asian  Mixed or Other   The odds of PICU admission were increased in CYP younger than 1 month old and decreased among 15-17 year olds compared to 1-4 year olds with COVID-19  increased in older CYP and females with PIMS-TS  and increased for Black compared to White ethnicity in patients with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS  Odds of PICU admission in COVID-19 were increased for CYP with comorbidities and highest for CYP with multiple medical problems  Increases in odds of PICU admission associated with different comorbidities in COVID-19 showed a similar pattern to other causes of hospitalization examined and  thus  likely reflect background vulnerabilities  These findings identify distinct risk factors associated with PICU admission among CYP with COVID-19 or PIMS-TS that might aid treatment and prevention strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931076

4382,Background  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic profoundly affected food systems including food security  Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food security is important to provide support and identify long-term impacts and needs  Objective  The National Food Access and COVID research Team  NFACT  was formed to assess food security over different US study sites throughout the pandemic  using common instruments and measurements  This study presents results from 18 study sites across 15 states and nationally over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  A validated survey instrument was developed and implemented in whole or part through an online survey of adults across the sites throughout the first year of the pandemic  representing 22 separate surveys  Sampling methods for each study site were convenience  representative  or high-risk targeted  Food security was measured using the USDA 6-item module  Food security prevalence was analyzed using ANOVA by sampling method to assess statistically significant differences  Results  Respondents  n   27 168  indicate higher prevalence of food insecurity  low or very low food security  since the COVID-19 pandemic  compared with before the pandemic  In nearly all study sites  there is a higher prevalence of food insecurity among Black  Indigenous  and People of Color  BIPOC   households with children  and those with job disruptions  The findings demonstrate lingering food insecurity  with high prevalence over time in sites with repeat cross-sectional surveys  There are no statistically significant differences between convenience and representative surveys  but a statistically higher prevalence of food insecurity among high-risk compared with convenience surveys  Conclusions  This comprehensive study demonstrates a higher prevalence of food insecurity in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic  These impacts were prevalent for certain demographic groups  and most pronounced for surveys targeting high-risk populations  Results especially document the continued high levels of food insecurity  as well as the variability in estimates due to the survey implementation method,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934898
5337,The standard neurology clinical experience in medical school focuses primarily on bedside patient encounters  however  the limitations of the clinical environment due to the current COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated the need for virtual curriculum development  To provide guidance to Neurology clerkship directors during this unprecedented time  the American Academy of Neurology  AAN  Undergraduate Education Subcommittee  UES  formed a workgroup to develop an outline for a  virtual curriculum   provide recommendations  and describe models of integrating virtual curricula into the neurology clerkship In this overview  we discuss different methods of virtual instruction  hybrid models of clerkship training and the challenges to its implementation  professionalism issues  and modification of feedback and assessment techniques specific to the virtual learning environment  We also offer suggestions for implementation of a hybrid virtual curriculum into the neurology clerkship The virtual curriculum is intended to supplement the core neurology in-person clinical experience and should not be used for shortening or replacing the required neurology clinical clerkship,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921103
5217,PURPOSE OF REVIEW  Managing patients with glomerular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging  as the infection risk associated with immunosuppression must be balanced against the need to control severe glomerular disease that can lead to kidney failure  This review provides an overview of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with glomerular disease  RECENT FINDINGS  Registry data  although biased towards outcomes of hospitalized patients  suggest that the mortality from COVID-19 is higher in patients with glomerular disease than in the general population  Glucocorticoid use prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19  Rituximab significantly attenuates serological responses to both natural infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2  although it is not clear whether this leads to adverse outcomes  Case reports of disease flares occurring after vaccination have been reported  but causality in any of these cases has yet to be proven and the absolute risk remains very small  SUMMARY  Patients with glomerular disease represent an at-risk group for severe COVID-19 disease and vaccination is key to reducing this risk  As immunosuppressed patients demonstrate an attenuated response to vaccination  the efficacy of a third primary dose followed by a subsequent booster is being investigated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923542
326,The primary objective of this work is to investigate the mixing of droplets aerosols  which originates from the sneezing coughing  of possibly COVID-19 patient  with the ambient atmosphere  Effectively  we are studying the growth decay of droplets aerosols in the presence of inhomogeneous mixing  which focuses on the phenomena of entrainment of the  relatively  dry ambient air  We have varied the initial standard deviation  mean radius of the droplets aerosols size distribution  and humidity of the ambient atmosphere to understand their effects on the final size spectra of droplets  Furthermore  a rigorous error analysis is carried out to understand the relative importance of these effects on the final spectra of droplets aerosols  We find that these are vital parameters to determine the final spectra of droplets  which govern the broadening of the size spectra  Typically  broadening the size spectra of droplets aerosols increases the probability of the virus-laden droplets aerosols and thus could affect the transmission of infection in the ambient atmosphere,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002200
437,INTRODUCTION  To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on  1  number of clinical visits   2  magnetic resonance  MR  scans  and  3  treatment prescriptions in a multiple sclerosis  MS  referral centre  METHODS  Retrospective study covering January 2018 to May 2021  RESULTS  The monthly mean  standard deviation  SD   of visits performed in 2020  814 137 6   was similar to 2018  741 99 7   p   0 153   and 2019  797 116 3   p   0 747   During the COVID-19 period  2020 year   36 3  of the activity was performed through telemedicine  The number of MR scans performed dropped by 76 6  during the  first wave   March 14 to June 21  2020  compared to the mean monthly activity in 2020  183 5 68 9    with a recovery during the subsequent two months  The monthly mean of treatment prescriptions approved in 2020  24 1 7 0   was lower than in 2019  30 7 0   p   0 049   but similar to 2018  23 8 8 0   p   0 727   Natalizumab prescriptions increased in the  first wave  and onwards  whereas anti-CD20 prescriptions decreased during the COVID-19 period  CONCLUSION  Maintenance of the number of clinical visits was likely due to telemedicine adoption  Although the number of MR dramatically dropped during the  first wave   an early recovery was observed  Treatment prescriptions suffered a slight quantitative decrease during 2020  whereas substantial qualitative changes were found in specific treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001198
8990,During the COVID-19 pandemic  a phenomenon emerged in which some patients with severe disease were critically ill and could not be discharged from the ICU even though they exhibited negative viral tests  To explore the underlying mechanism  we collected blood samples from these patients and analyzed the gene expression profiles of peripheral immune cells  We found that all enrolled patients  regardless of changes in genes related to different symptoms and inflammatory responses  showed universally and severely decreased expression of adaptive immunity-related genes  especially those related to T B cell arms and HLA molecules  and that these patients exhibited long-term secondary infections  In addition  no significant change was found in the expression of classic immunosuppression molecules including PD-1  PD-L1  and CTLA-4  suggesting that the adaptive immune suppression may not be due to the change of these genes  According to the published literatures and our data  this adaptive immunosuppression is likely to be caused by the  dysregulated host response  to severe infection  similar to the immunosuppression that exists in other severely infected patients with sepsis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867988
6240,Objective  Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eventually recommended wearing masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus  the practice has been unevenly distributed in the United States  Methods  In this article  we model county-level infrequent mask usage as a function of three pillars of conservatism   1  Republican political leadership  percentage of votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election    2  conservative Protestantism  percentage evangelical Christian   and  3  right-wing media consumption  Google searches for Fox News   Results  Our analyses indicate that mask usage tends to be lower in counties with greater support for President Trump  in majority Trump counties   counties with more evangelical Christians  and areas with greater interest in Fox News  Conclusion  Given the effectiveness of masks in limiting the transmission of respiratory droplets  conservative ideological resistance to public health and recommended pandemic lifestyles may indirectly support the spread of the coronavirus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908612
8909,Qatar  a country with a strong health system and a diverse population consisting mainly of expatriate residents  has experienced two large waves of COVID-19 outbreak  In this study  we report on 2634 SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences from infected patients in Qatar between March-2020 and March-2021  representing 1 5  of all positive cases in this period  Despite the restrictions on international travel  the viruses sampled from the populace of Qatar mirrored nearly the entire global population s genomic diversity with nine predominant viral lineages that were sustained by local transmission chains and the emergence of mutations that are likely to have originated in Qatar  We reported an increased number of mutations and deletions in B 1 1 7 and B 1 351 lineages in a short period  These findings raise the imperative need to continue the ongoing genomic surveillance that has been an integral part of the national response to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 profile and re-emergence in Qatar,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869069
4049,Since its outbreak in late 2019  the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a sharp rise in the demand for oxygen and ventilation facilities due to the associated extensive damage that it causes to the lungs  This study is considered the first and largest study in Saudi Arabia to evaluate the outcomes of tracheostomy in intubated COVID-19 patients  This is a retrospective  observational cohort study that was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City  KAMC  in Jeddah  Western Region  Saudi Arabia and King Fahad Armed Forces Hospital  Jeddah  Saudi Arabia  The findings of the study revealed that seventy-one patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheotomy between 1 March 2020 and 31 October 2020  The average period between intubation and tracheostomy was 9 97 days  Hypertension  diabetes  lung disease and obesity  BMI > 30  were significant risk factors of mortality  The overall 30-day mortality rate was 38 4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940008
8084,BACKGROUND  Worldwide  social media traffic increased following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  Although the spread of COVID-19 content has been described for several social media platforms  eg  Twitter and Facebook   little is known about how such content is spread via private messaging platforms  such as WhatsApp  WhatsApp LLC   OBJECTIVE  In this study  we documented  1  how WhatsApp is used to transmit COVID-19 content   2  the characteristics of WhatsApp users based on their usage patterns  and  3  how usage patterns link to COVID-19 concerns  METHODS  We used the experience sampling method to track day-to-day WhatsApp usage during the COVID-19 pandemic  For 1 week  participants reported each day the extent to which they had received  forwarded  or discussed COVID-19 content  The final data set comprised 924 data points  which were collected from 151 participants  RESULTS  During the weeklong monitoring process  most participants  143 151  94 7   reported at least 1 COVID-19-related use of WhatsApp  When a taxonomy was generated based on usage patterns  around 1 in 10 participants  21 151  13 9   were found to have received and shared a high volume of forwarded COVID-19 content  akin to super-spreaders identified on other social media platforms  Finally  those who engaged with more COVID-19 content in their personal chats were more likely to report having COVID-19-related thoughts throughout the day  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings provide a rare window into discourse on private messaging platforms  Such data can be used to inform risk communication strategies during the pandemic  TRIAL REGISTRATION  ClinicalTrials gov NCT04367363  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04367363,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881720
1794,Background Patients with advanced cardiac conditions value effective symptom control and empathic communication with their doctors  However  studies have shown that empathic communication with seriously ill patients does not occur adequately in cardiology  Therefore  we piloted a program for teaching communication skills in a bite-sized manner  The primary aim of the research was to understand the feasibility and acceptability of the training program and to perform a preliminary evaluation of its efficacy  Methodology Clinicians were recruited from the cardiology unit of a tertiary hospital in Singapore  Patients were also recruited for the audio recording of clinic consults  Recruited patients had to have a chronic cardiac condition and be deemed at risk of dying within one year  We utilized a pre-post intervention design  Prior to the educational intervention  clinicians were asked to audio record a single clinic consult at baseline  They were then asked to participate in a training program that consisted of video-annotated presentations and role-play scenarios  Subsequently  the audio recordings of their clinic consults with seriously ill patients were recorded  The audio recordings were evaluated by trainers and used for feedback with clinicians  Data on the completion rate of the training program were collected  In addition  changes in the clinicians  self-rated communication skills and views on the acceptability and relevance of the training program were collected  Results Overall  five of the six clinicians  83 3   completed all sessions in the program  One clinician only completed four out of the five sessions in the program  Clinicians deemed the program acceptable and relevant and found audio recordings to be useful for reflective learning  There was an improvement in the clinicians  self-assessed competency  However  the planned number of audio recordings could not be completed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic  Conclusions The pilot training program was acceptable and relevant for the participants  However  it will require adaptation to allow it to be transferrable and scalable to all settings  especially in situations that limit prolonged face-to-face contact,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976539

5138,The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a threat to people all across the globe  According to traditional literature  threat perceptions induce anti-immigrant sentiments  as ingroup identity and self-interest are strengthened at the expense of the outgroup  In this study  we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic indeed increases anti-immigrant sentiments  or that this type of threat elicits other or no group related responses  We also look at whether such responses are expressed more strongly among specific subgroups in Dutch society  To do so  we use unique longitudinal panel data based on the European Values Study 2017  with a repeated measure in May 2020  during the national  intelligent lockdown  in the Netherlands  Based on structural equation modeling  we demonstrate that anti-immigrant sentiments have not increased due to  perceived threat of  the COVID-19 pandemic  In fact  negative opinions towards immigrants decreased between 2017 and 2020 in the Netherlands  for which we provide alternative explanations  Although some subgroups do experience more threat than others due to the coronavirus  such as women  first generation immigrants  and the elderly  this does not lead to more negative feelings towards outgroups  Whether this is due to the fact that individuals feel threatened by everyone  regardless of group membership  should be explored in future research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924645
5070,Background  The host immune response has a prominent role in the progression and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection  Lymphopenia has been described as an important feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection and has been associated with severe disease manifestation  Lymphocyte dysregulation and hyper-inflammation have been shown to be associated with a more severe clinical course  however  a T cell subpopulation whose dysfunction correlate with disease progression has yet to be identify  Methods  We performed an immuno-phenotypic analysis of T cell sub-populations in peripheral blood from patients affected by different severity of COVID-19  n 60  and undergoing a different clinical evolution  Clinical severity was established based on a modified WHO score considering both ventilation support and respiratory capacity  PaO2 FiO2 ratio   The ability of circulating cells at baseline to predict the probability of clinical aggravation was explored through multivariate regression analyses  Results  The immuno-phenotypic analysis performed by multi-colour flow cytometry confirmed that patients suffering from severe COVID-19 harboured significantly reduced circulating T cell subsets  especially for CD4    T  Th1  and regulatory T cells  Peripheral T cells also correlated with parameters associated with disease severity  i e   PaO2 FiO2 ratio and inflammation markers  CD4    T cell subsets showed an important significant association with clinical evolution  with patients presenting markedly decreased regulatory T cells at baseline having a significantly higher risk of aggravation  Importantly  the combination of gender and regulatory T cells allowed distinguishing between improved and worsened patients with an area under the ROC curve  AUC  of 82   Conclusions  The present study demonstrates the association between CD4    T cell dysregulation and COVID-19 severity and progression  Our results support the importance of analysing baseline regulatory T cell levels  since they were revealed able to predict the clinical worsening during hospitalization  Regulatory T cells assessment soon after hospital admission could thus allow a better clinical stratification and patient management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925369
798,The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic placed a dramatic burden on managed healthcare and perhaps nowhere as evident as in neurological and psychiatric disease care  This said  the duration of the pandemic mandated adaptability of the entire care system and the oft-vaunted benefits of telehealth and telemedicine were subjected to deep scrutiny at scale  Positive experiences were reported by both patients and providers from routine check-ups  to use of cognitive behavioral therapy associated with mental disorders  and management of complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis and other neurological and psychiatric conditions  Integration into standard care looks likely in the post pandemic era with many healthcare systems moving to expand reimbursement categories and develop equitable incentive models for developers and providers  In this commentary we share perspective on how the future of care may evolve through hybrid delivery models  and the advent of new therapeutic approaches which can address pain points identified during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993505
7691,Aging is considered to be a decline in physical and physiological events that extensively affect the body s immunity  and is linked with deterioration in both innate and adaptive immune responses  The immune system exhibits profound age-associated variations  known as immunosenescence  comprising a significantly low production of B and T lymphocytes in bone marrow and thymus  a decreased function of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues  a decrease in the synthesis of fresh naive T cells  and reduced activation of T cells  Elderly individuals face a greater risk for many diseases particularly respiratory diseases due to their poor response to immune challenges as vigorously as the young  The current review explored the aging immune system  highlight the mortality rates of severe lung complications  such as pneumonia  COVID-19  asthma  COPD  lung cancer  IPF  and acute lung injury  and their correlation with aging immunity  This study can be helpful in better understanding the pathophysiology of aging  immune responses  and developing new approaches to improve the average age of the elderly population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888279
2319,BACKGROUND  Covid-19 vaccination has started in the majority of the countries at the global level  Cancer patients are at high risk for infection  serious illness  and death from COVID-19 and need vaccination guidance and support  Guidance availability in the English language only is a major limit for recommendations  delivery and their application in the world s population and generates information inequalities across the different populations  METHODS  Most of the available COVID-19 vaccination guidance for cancer patients was screened and scrutinized by the European Cancer Patients Coalition  ECPC  and an international oncology panel of 52 physicians from 33 countries  RESULTS  A summary guidance was developed and provided in 28 languages in order to reach more than 70 percent of the global population  CONCLUSION  Language barrier and e-guidance availability in the native language are the most important barriers when communicating with patients  E-guidance availability in various native languages should be considered a major priority by international medical and health organizations that are communicating with patients at the global level < P>,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967300
1483,Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  MERS-CoV  emerged into humans in 2012  causing highly lethal respiratory disease  The severity of disease may be in part because MERS-CoV is adept at antagonizing early innate immune pathways - interferon  IFN  production and signaling  protein kinase R  PKR   and oligoadenylate synthetase ribonuclease L  OAS RNase L  - generated in response to viral double-stranded  ds RNA generated during genome replication  This is in contrast to SARS-CoV-2  which we recently reported activates PKR and RNase L and to some extent  IFN signaling  We previously found that MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a  dsRNA binding protein  and NS4b  phosphodiesterase  could weakly suppress these pathways  but ablation of each had minimal effect on virus replication  Here we investigated the antagonist effects of the conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease  EndoU   in combination with NS4a or NS4b  Inactivation of EndoU catalytic activity alone in a recombinant MERS-CoV caused little if any effect on activation of the innate immune pathways during infection  However  infection with recombinant viruses containing combined mutations with inactivation of EndoU and deletion of NS4a or inactivation of the NS4b phosphodiesterase promoted robust activation of the dsRNA-induced innate immune pathways  This resulted in ten-fold attenuation of replication in human lung derived A549 and primary nasal cells  Furthermore  replication of these recombinant viruses could be rescued to the level of WT MERS-CoV by knockout of host immune mediators MAVS  PKR  or RNase L  Thus  EndoU and accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b together suppress dsRNA-induced innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection in order to optimize viral replication  Importance  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  MERS-CoV  causes highly lethal respiratory disease  MERS-CoV encodes several innate immune antagonists  accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b unique to the merbeco lineage and the nsp15 protein endoribonuclease  EndoU   conserved among all coronaviruses  While mutation of each antagonist protein alone has little effect on innate immunity  infections with recombinant MERS-CoVs with mutations of EndoU in combination with either NS4a or NS4b  activate innate signaling pathways and are attenuated for replication  Our data indicate that EndoU and accessory proteins NS4a and NS4b together suppress innate immunity during MERS-CoV infection  to optimize viral replication  This is in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 which activates these pathways and consistent with greater mortality observed during MERS-CoV infection compared to SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981054

5826,Background  Attempts to quantify effect sizes of non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPI  to control COVID-19 in the US have not accounted for heterogeneity in social or environmental factors that may influence NPI effectiveness  This study quantifies national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs during the early months of the pandemic in the US  Methods  Daily county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths during the first wave  January 2020 through phased removal of interventions  were obtained  County-level cases  doubling times  and death rates were compared to four increasingly restrictive NPI levels  Socio-demographic  climate and mobility factors were analyzed to explain and evaluate NPI heterogeneity  with mobility used to approximate NPI compliance  Analyses were conducted separately for the US and for each Census regions  Pacific  Mountain  east West North Central  East West South Central  South Atlantic  Middle Atlantic and New England   A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial analysis was used  leveraging the phased implementation of policies  Results  Aggressive  level 4  NPIs were associated with slower COVID-19 propagation  particularly in high compliance counties  Longer duration of level 4 NPIs was associated with lower case rates  log beta -0 028  95  CI -0 04 to -0 02  and longer doubling times  log beta 0 02  95  CI 0 01-0 03   Effects varied by Census region  for example  level 4 effects on doubling time in Pacific states were opposite to those in Middle Atlantic and New England states  NPI heterogeneity can be explained by differential timing of policy initiation and by variable socio-demographic county characteristics that predict compliance  particularly poverty and racial ethnic population  Climate exhibits relatively consistent relationships across Census regions  for example  higher minimum temperature and specific humidity were associated with lower doubling times and higher death rates for this period of analysis in South Central  South Atlantic  Middle Atlantic  and New England states  Conclusion and Relevance  Heterogeneity exists in both the effectiveness of NPIs across US Census regions and policy compliance  This county-level variability indicates that control strategies are best designed at community-levels where policies can be tuned based on knowledge of local disparities and compliance with public health ordinances,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912768
8850,Objectives  The COVID-19 pandemic may impact cigarette smokers  behaviors  Among smokers  perceptions about the risks of contracting COVID-19 and the severity of COVID-19 illness likely vary  and perceptions may be associated with individual smoking behavior  Our study measured smokers  perceptions of COVID-19 risks and their association with smoking and quitting outcomes  Methods  A sample of 1 223 U S  adult cigarette smokers participated in an online survey in October-November 2020 to assess their COVID-19-related risk perceptions and changes in smoking  readiness to quit  and quit attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic  Results  More smokers believed smoking could increase the severity of COVID-19  43 6   95  CI  40 1  47 3  than believed smoking makes them more susceptible to COVID-19  20 0   95  CI  17 2  23 0    While there were no associations between perceptions of COVID-19 susceptibility and smoking behaviors or intentions  perceptions of greater smoking-related COVID-19 severity were associated with both higher likelihood of smoking increases  aOR  2 16  95  CI  1 19  3 93  and greater readiness to quit smoking  aOR  1 65  95  CI  1 18  2 30   Greater perceptions of general COVID-19 severity were associated with higher likelihood of smoking reductions  aOR  1 12  95  CI  1 02  1 22   greater readiness to quit smoking  aOR  1 14  95  CI  1 07  1 22   and higher likelihood of making a quit attempt  aOR  1 12  95  CI  1 04  1 22   Conclusions  Smokers  perceptions about COVID-19 severity are related to their smoking behavior and likelihood of making a quit attempt  Providing smokers with accurate information on the relationship between smoking and the severity of COVID-19 may alter smoking behaviors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869823
9643,BACKGROUND  SARS CoV-2 has caused a pandemic that has challenged both clinicians and researchers in finding an effective treatment option  Currently there only exists a two series vaccine that has a high efficacy in preventing infection  There is no standard effective treatment against SARS CoV-2 however several nutraceuticals such as melatonin  zinc  selenium  vitamin C and vitamin D are being proposed as prevention and treatment options,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857253
9729,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is an infectious respiratory condition sustained by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   which manifests prevalently as mild to moderate respiratory tract infection  Nevertheless  in a number of cases the clinical course may deteriorate  with onset of end organ injury  systemic dysfunction  thrombosis and ischemia  Given the clinical picture  baseline assessment and serial monitoring of blood lactate concentration may be conceivably useful in COVID-19  We hence performed a systematic literature review to explore the possible association between increased blood lactate levels  disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients  including comparison of lactate values between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients  We carried out an electronic search in Medline and Scopus  using the keywords  COVID-19  OR  SARS-CoV-2  AND  lactate  OR  lactic acid  OR  hyperlactatemia   between 2019 and present time  i e  October 10  2021   which allowed to identify 19 studies  totalling 6 459 patients  Overall  we found that COVID-19 patients with worse outcome tend to display higher lactate values than those with better outcome  although most COVID-19 patients in the studies included in our analysis did not have sustained baseline hyperlactatemia  Substantially elevated lactate values were neither consistently present in all COVID-19 patients who developed unfavourable clinical outcomes  These findings suggest that blood lactate monitoring upon admission and throughout hospitalization may be useful for early identification of higher risk of unfavourable COVID-19 illness progression  though therapeutic decisions based on using conventional hyperlactatemia cut-off values  i e   2 0 mmol L  upon first evaluation may be inappropriate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856090
4271,The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has led to the COVID-19 pandemic  Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance  One alternative is the main protease  Mpro  due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle  Here  we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout  The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C- N-terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro  Autolytic cleavage releases positively-charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes  t <10 min   We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices <10 nM  We further assayed ten COVID-negative subjects and found no false-positive result  In the light of simplicity  our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory  but also is amenable to integrating as portable point-of-care devices including those on face-coverings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936725
3257,RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES  We aimed to assess early COVID-19 pandemic-associated changes in brain MRI examination frequency and acuity of imaging findings acuity  METHODS  Using a natural language processing model  we retrospectively categorized reported findings of 12 346 brain MRI examinations performed during 6-month pre-pandemic and early pandemic time periods across a large metropolitan health system into 3 acuity levels   1  normal or near normal   2  incidental or chronic findings not requiring a management change  and  3  new or progressive findings requiring a management change  Brain MRI frequency and imaging finding acuity level were compared over time  RESULTS  Between March and August of 2019  pre-pandemic  and 2020  early pandemic   our health system brain MRI examination volumes decreased 17 0   6745 vs 5601   Comparing calendar-matched 6-month periods  the proportion of higher acuity findings increased significantly  P< 0 001  from pre-pandemic  22 5   43 6  and 34 0  in acuity level 1  2  and 3  respectively  to early pandemic periods  19 1   40 9   and 40 1    During the second 3 months of the early pandemic period  as MRI volumes recovered to near baseline  the proportion of higher acuity findings remained high  42 6  vs 34 1   compared with a similar pre-pandemic period  In a multivariable analysis  Black  B coefficient  0 16  and underinsured population  B coefficient  0 33  presented with higher acuity findings  P< 0 05   CONCLUSIONS  As the volume of brain MRI examinations decreased during the early COVID-19 pandemic  the relative proportion of examinations with higher acuity findings increased significantly  Pandemic-related changes in patient outcomes related to reduced imaging access merits further attention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955284
3570,We conducted a large-scale survey in the Japanese population  about one year after the initial declaration of the state of emergency  to investigate alcohol use under the prolonged coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic and its related psychosocial and demographic characteristics  The survey was conducted online between 15 and 20 June 2021  A total of 11 427 participants were included in the analysis  48 5  female  48 82   - 13 30 years  range   20-90 years   Compared with females  males were more prevalent in the hazardous user and the potential alcoholism group and were less prevalent in the no alcohol-related problem group  However  the prevalence of potential alcoholism among the participants in our study was higher than that previously reported  This trend was particularly pronounced in women  The presence of potential alcoholism was related to a deteriorated psychological status  particularly depression and anxiety  and various difficulties in their daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic  In the future  intervention methods and systems should be developed to provide optimal assistance to people with psychological problems who are vulnerable to alcohol-related problems during the COVID-19 pandemic  while conducting further long-term follow-up studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948939

9745,The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing travel behaviour in many urban areas around the world since the beginning of 2020  As a consequence  bike-sharing schemes have been affected-partly due to the change in travel demand and behaviour as well as a shift from public transit  This study estimates the varying effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the London bike-sharing system  Santander Cycles  over the period March-December 2020  We employed a Bayesian second-order random walk time-series model to account for temporal correlation in the data  We compared the observed number of cycle hires and hire time with their respective counterfactuals  what would have been if the pandemic had not happened  to estimate the magnitude of the change caused by the pandemic  The results indicated that following a reduction in cycle hires in March and April 2020  the demand rebounded from May 2020  remaining in the expected range of what would have been if the pandemic had not occurred  This could indicate the resiliency of Santander Cycles  With respect to hire time  an important increase occurred in April  May  and June 2020  indicating that bikes were hired for longer trips  perhaps partly due to a shift from public transit,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855914
4113,The prominent rise of social networks within the past decade have become a gold mine for data mining operations seeking to model the real world through these virtual worlds  One of the most important applications that has been proposed is utilizing information generated from social networks as a supplemental health surveillance system to monitor disease epidemics  At the time this research was conducted in 2020  the COVID-19 virus had evolved into a global pandemic  forcing many countries to implement preventative measures to halt its expanse  Health surveillance has been a powerful tool in placing further preventative measures  however it is not a perfect system  and slowly collected  misidentified information can prove detrimental to these efforts  This research proposes a new potential surveillance avenue through unsupervised machine learning using dynamic  evolutionary variants of clustering algorithms DBSCAN and the Louvain method to allow for community detection in temporal networks  This technique is paired with geographical data collected directly from the social media Twitter  to create an effective and accurate health surveillance system that grows as time passes  The experimental results show that the proposed system is promising and has the potential to be an advancement on current machine learning health surveillance techniques,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939040
8515,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 hospitalizations of non-institutionalized persons during the first COVID-19 wave in Connecticut disproportionately affected the elderly  communities of color  and individuals of low socioeconomic status  SES   Whether the magnitude of these disparities changed after the initial lockdown and before vaccine rollout is not well documented  METHODS  All first-time hospitalizations with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during July to December 2020  including patients  geocoded residential addresses  were obtained from the Connecticut Department of Public Health  Those living in congregate settings  including nursing homes  were excluded  Community-dwelling patients were assigned census tract-level poverty and crowding measures from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey by linking their geocoded addresses to census tracts  Age-adjusted incidence and relative rates were calculated across demographic and SES measures and compared with those from a similar analysis of hospitalized cases during the initial wave  RESULTS  During July to December 2020  there were 5652 COVID-19 hospitalizations in community residents in Connecticut  Incidence was highest among those >85 years  non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanic Latinx compared with non-Hispanic Whites  relative rate  RR  3 1  95  confidence interval  CI  2 83-3 32  and 5 9  95  CI 5 58-6 28    and persons living in high poverty and high crowding census tracts  Although racial ethnic and SES disparities during the study period were substantial  they were significantly decreased compared with the first wave of COVID-19  CONCLUSIONS  The finding of persistent  if reduced  large racial ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations 2-7 months after the initial lockdown was relaxed and before vaccination was widely available is of concern  These disparities cause a challenge to achieving health equity and are relevant for future pandemic planning,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874099
2233,OBJECTIVES  To assess and compare the pharmaceutical analysis on drug management in a geriatric acute care unit prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  This was a single-centre  retrospective  and comparative cohort study  All Pharmacist Interventions  PIs  carried out in the unit between 27 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 were distinguished according to whether they were conducted prior to or during the first wave of COVID-19  The main outcome measure was the rate of PIs per patient and per prescription lines analysed  Other data collected were the drug class managed by the PI  the Drug Related Problems  DRP  identified  the nature of the advice given  and the acceptance rate by geriatricians  RESULTS  A total of 355 patients were analysed  with PIs generated for 21 7  of the patients prior to COVID-19  and for 53 4  of the patients during the first wave  p<0 001   Among the 4 402 prescription lines analysed  54 PIs were carried out for prescriptions prior to COVID-19  and 177 during the first wave  p 0 002   DRPs were mostly related to anti-infectious drugs during the pandemic  20 3   p 0 038   and laxatives prior to the pandemic  13 0   p 0 023   The clinical impact of the PIs was mainly moderate  43 7    The acceptance rate was 59 3   CONCLUSIONS  A greater amount of DRPs were detected and more therapeutic advice was proposed during the first wave of COVID-19  with a focus on drugs used for the management of COVID-19 rather than geriatric routine treatments  The needs for clinical pharmacists were strengthened during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968479
4185,Chest imaging can represent a powerful tool for detecting the Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Among the available technologies  the chest Computed Tomography  CT  scan is an effective approach for reliable and early detection of the disease  However  it could be difficult to rapidly identify by human inspection anomalous area in CT images belonging to the COVID-19 disease  Hence  it becomes necessary the exploitation of suitable automatic algorithms able to quick and precisely identify the disease  possibly by using few labeled input data  because large amounts of CT scans are not usually available for the COVID-19 disease  The method proposed in this paper is based on the exploitation of the compact and meaningful hidden representation provided by a Deep Denoising Convolutional Autoencoder  DDCAE   Specifically  the proposed DDCAE  trained on some target CT scans in an unsupervised way  is used to build up a robust statistical representation generating a target histogram  A suitable statistical distance measures how this target histogram is far from a companion histogram evaluated on an unknown test scan  if this distance is greater of a threshold  the test image is labeled as anomaly  i e  the scan belongs to a patient affected by COVID-19 disease  Some experimental results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of the proposed approach reaching a top accuracy of 100  and similar high values for other metrics  In conclusion  by using a statistical representation of the hidden features provided by DDCAEs  the developed architecture is able to differentiate COVID-19 from normal and pneumonia scans with high reliability and at low computational cost,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937995
564,The COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed the health systems of many countries in the world and comorbidities in adults have exponentially increased their mortality  in matters of asthma  it has not been possible to establish a defining relationship in mortality  The clinical manifestations of asthmatic patients with SARS COV 2 are presented in a wide range  from asymptomatic to those who experience acute respiratory failure  The most sensitive method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is RT-PCR  Antigen and serologic tests are quicker than RT-PCR  but they are less sensitive  Radiologic studies and the computed tomography of the chest assist in the diagnosis and follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 infection  The use of spirometry for diagnosis and follow-up is restricted due to the elevated risk of contagion  It has been shown that eosinophilia and TH2 inflammation  due to their antiviral immune effect  are protective factors against severe SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19  Patients with mild asthma express less angiotensin converting enzyme receptors  ACE2   and those with neutrophilic asthma express it in greater proportion  which suggests more severe presentations of COVID-19  The conventional asthma treatment modulates the SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 immune response  which is why patients with controlled asthma have non-severe manifestations of COVID 19  however  the mechanisms are not clear,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34998306

2214,Vaccine rejection is a problem severely impacting the global society  especially considering the COVID-19 outbreak  The need to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the active involvement of the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine movements is therefore very important both from a theoretical and practical perspective  This paper investigates the group identities of people with positive and negative attitudes towards vaccination  and their attitudes toward general science  A targeted sample study of 192 pro-vaccine and 156 anti-vaccine group members showed that the group identity of pro-vaccine individuals is higher than of anti-vaccine individuals  and that both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine individuals had a positive attitude toward science  Results are discussed in context of the heterogeneity of motivations causing vaccine rejection and the relation between active involvement in online discussion and group identity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969055
1941,Although the vast majority of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infections are uncomplicated  our understanding of predictors of symptom resolution and viral shedding cessation remains limited  We characterized symptom trajectories and oropharyngeal viral shedding among 120 outpatients with uncomplicated Coronavirus Disease of 2019  COVID-19  enrolled in a clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda  which demonstrated no clinical or virologic benefit compared with placebo  In the combined trial cohort  objective fever was uncommon  inflammatory symptoms  myalgias  fatigue  peaked at 4 to 5 days postsymptom onset  and cough peaked at 9 days  The median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days  95  confidence interval 14-18   SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity at enrollment was associated with hastened resolution of viral shedding  hazard ratio 1 80  95  confidence interval 1 05-3 1  P   0 03   but not with symptom resolution  Inflammatory symptoms were associated with a significantly greater odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection  respiratory symptoms were not  These findings have important implications for COVID-19 screening approaches and trial design,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974350
7836,Background  Multiple sclerosis  MS  is associated with lower quality of life  reduced social participation  and decreased self-efficacy  The COVID-19 pandemic has had documented effects on the health and wellbeing of people with and without MS  Previous research has demonstrated the positive impact pets can have for people living with long-term conditions  Objectives  To explore the rates of pet ownership and pet attachment in people living with MS and pet ownership associations with quality of life  satisfaction with social roles  and self-efficacy scores  and to explore the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on people s perceived relationships with their pets  Materials and Methods  A postal questionnaire was distributed to members of a local MS Register and a control group of people without MS  The questionnaire assessed quality of life  satisfaction with social roles  self-efficacy  the perceived roles of pets  and pet-related concerns experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic  Results  No apparent difference in attachment to pets was found between the patient and control groups  Pet ownership and level of attachment were not associated with differences in quality of life or self-efficacy scores in people living with MS  Using multiple regression analysis  pet ownership was associated with a decrease in satisfaction with participation in social roles  but with the estimated effect being small compared to having a diagnosis of MS or being unemployed  Most participants reported that pets had positive roles during the pandemic  and the most reported pet-related concern was access to veterinary treatment  Conclusion  Pet owners both with and without MS reported subjective benefits to their wellbeing from pet ownership during COVID-19  although analysis suggested that pet ownership was associated with a reduction in satisfaction with social roles  The study had several limitations and suggestions are made for future work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886405
4995,The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused tragic morbidity and mortality  In attempt to reduce this morbidity and mortality  most countries implemented population-wide lockdowns  Here we show that the lockdowns were based on several flawed assumptions  including  no one is protected until everyone is protected    lockdowns are highly effective to reduce transmission    lockdowns have a favorable cost-benefit balance   and  lockdowns are the only effective option   Focusing on the latter  we discuss that Emergency Management principles provide a better way forward to manage the public emergency of the pandemic  Specifically  there are three priorities including the following  first  protect those most at risk by separating them from the threat  mitigation   second  ensure critical infrastructure is ready for people who get sick  preparation and response   and third  shift the response from fear to confidence  recovery   We argue that  based on Emergency Management principles  the age-dependent risk from SARS-CoV-2  the minimal  at best  efficacy of lockdowns  and the terrible cost-benefit trade-offs of lockdowns  we need to reset the pandemic response  We can manage risk and save more lives from both COVID-19 and lockdowns  thus achieving far better outcomes in both the short- and long-term,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926364
7068,The tourism activities linked to artificial provisioning of blacktip reef sharks  Carcharhinus melanopterus  and pink whiprays  Pateobatis fai  on a specific site in French Polynesia were suddenly and completely stopped due to a COVID-19 lockdown that lasted 6 weeks from March 20 until April 30  2020  Using both drone footage and underwater counting  we were able to track the abundance of those two species before  during  and after reopening and thus investigate the impact of provisioning on wild shark populations  The absence of any stimulus during this long period resulted in almost total desertion of the site by the elasmobranchs  However  1 day prior to reopening  some individuals of both species positively reacted to the single acoustic stimulus of an engine boat  showing the resilience of conditioning  and some elasmobranchs reacted to acoustic and olfactive stimuli linked to the provisioning practice from the first day after reopening  During the first 2 weeks after reopening  the abundance of both species remained at reduced levels comparable to those observed between 2008 and 2010 for sharks  i e   around 9 animals in the presence of local tourists  Pre-lockdown abundance levels  reaching approximatively 15 individuals for sharks and 10 for rays  were considered restored 1 and 2 months after reopening for blacktip reef sharks and pink whiprays  respectively  These findings improve our capacity to better understand the potential effects of artificial provisioning tourism on the abundance of elasmobranchs by showing that conditioning is resilient for several weeks  suggesting that intermittent interruption of elasmobranchs feeding would not really help to decrease its impact on animal welfare,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898773

4450,Purpose  Majority of the assessments  appraisals and placements have been disturbed  with some being cancelled  postponed  or modified in design  New approaches for assessment should be well-thought-out  This work attempts at capturing the collective wisdom of educators in the Middle East and North Africa region  MENA   providing an understanding of the online assessment conceptual framework in the era of COVID-19 that tells the story rather than determining cause and effect  and identifying the biggest gaps that derail the digital transformation  Methods  A qualitative inductive study using the grounded theory approach was implemented following a synchronous virtual online meeting  a summary of the reflections as well as experiences of medical education experts was prepared  Data for this qualitative study were collected from the meeting  The meeting was video-recorded and transcribed by the researchers  Thematic analysis was performed by three separate researcher coders  The authors then discussed together until they reached a consensus  Results  Three main thematic areas were identified  1  feasibility  2  exam fairness equity and 3  acceptable graduate attributes  society community acceptance  Conclusion  The COVID-19 era necessitated revisiting of our assessment strategies to cope with new changes within the available context  Rapid adaptation is required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934380
1730,Beyond its devastating consequences for public health  the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on gender inequalities  labour markets and families  Compared to many European countries  the French approach to lockdown was among the more stringent  although the measures taken by the French government to support employment  to some extent  mitigated the worst effects of the crisis on families  This article analyses the implications of COVID lockdown restrictions on gender equality and well-being for couples with children in France  The study adopted a multidimensional approach to gender inequalities associated with paid work and various dimensions of living conditions  involving gender-differentiated access to personal work spaces in the home  personal leisure time outside the home  and local support networks during the first phase of lockdown  March-June 2020   Drawing on data from the COCONEL survey  carried out by the Institut national d etudes demographiques on a quota sample of the French adult population in April May 2020  the authors controlled for variables including socio-economic status  age  family structure and place of residence  The survey data were complemented by a longitudinal set of in-depth interviews enabling the research team to capture the differential effects of the pandemic within couples  The main findings indicate that  despite the frequency of dual-employment arrangements for heterosexual couple households with dependent children  French mothers were nevertheless more likely to reduce their working time and or withdraw from the labour market  Within the households surveyed  mothers were less likely than fathers to leave the home during the day  particularly for personal leisure activities  The presence of children in households increased gender inequality in both employment and living conditions across all socio-economic categories  In conclusion  the authors consider whether the pandemic might have a long-term impact on gender norms and inequalities within families  and how the findings about changes in gender inequalities could be used to inform public policy development,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977229
7625,AIM  This study analysed the impact that COVID-19 and the response measures implemented by the Spanish Government have had on families of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities  METHOD  Data on 323 family members  M   52 3 years old  SD   10 5  were collected through an online survey  which was focused on analysing difficulties experienced and service provision during lockdown  RESULTS  Many families  66 3   have seen their level of stress increased during lockdown because of  among other reasons  a greater burden of care  Difficulties were associated with the closure and changes in disability-related services  Families of people with extensive support needs have generally experienced greater difficulties  CONCLUSION  Support services should have been considered essential services during lockdown  The failure to receive support has resulted in excessive burden on families  who had to assume a multitude of roles to support their family member with intellectual and developmental disability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888996
4362,AIM  With growing evidence on the protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEIs  and angiotensin receptor blockers  ARBs  in coronavirus disease 2019  Covid-19   we aimed to thoroughly investigate the association between the use of major classes of antihypertensive medications and Covid-19 outcomes in comparison with the use of ACEIs and ARBs  METHODS  We conducted a population-based study in patients with pre-existing hypertension in the UK Biobank with data from the first two SARS-CoV-2 waves prior population-based vaccination  Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed adjusting for a wide range of confounders  RESULTS  The use of either beta-blockers  BBs   calcium-channel blockers  CCBs   or diuretics was associated with a higher risk of Covid-19 hospitalization compared to ACEI use  adjusted OR  95 CI   1 66  1 43-1 93   and ARB use  1 53  1 30-1 81    The risk of 28-day mortality among Covid-19 patients was also increased among users of BBs  CCBs or diuretics when compared to ACEI users  1 74  1 30-2 33   but not when compared to ARB users  1 26  0 93-1 71    The association between BB  CCB or diuretics use  compared to ACEI use  and 28-day mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients narrowly missed statistical significance  1 47  0 99-2 18   but it was statistically significant when the analysis was restricted to patients hospitalized during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave  1 80  1 15-2 83    CONCLUSION  Our results suggest protective effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on Covid-19 hospitalization and mortality  particularly with ACEI  among patients with pharmaceutically treated hypertension  If confirmed by randomized controlled trials  this finding could have high clinical relevance for treating hypertension during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935181

6315,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  Literature suggests that funding for pediatric clinical trials is inequitably awarded  Furthermore  although coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  affected all hospitals  institutions with already limited resources were more severely impacted  We hypothesized that there would be difference in schools and hospitals that were able to participate in the initial round of pediatric COVID-19 clinical research  METHODS  We searched online databases for preregistered studies using the keywords  COVID-19    COVID    SARS-CoV-2    2019-nCov    2019 novel coronavirus   and  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   Search results were limited to studies enrolling participants from birth to 17 years  studies started in 2020  and studies originating in the United states  We calculated the proportion of institutions with active COVID-19 pediatric clinical studies in 2020 and compared institutional characteristics between institutions with and without at least one qualifying COVID-19 study  using rank-sum tests  chi2 tests  or Fisher s exact tests  as appropriate  RESULTS  We identified 150 allopathic medical schools  34 osteopathic medical schools  and 178 children s hospitals meeting inclusion criteria  Among included institutions  25  of medical schools and 20  children s hospitals participated in 1 of the registered pediatric COVID-19 studies the year before the study period  Institutions that participated in pediatric COVID-19 studies had more publications  more National Institutes of Health funding  and more studies registered on Clinicaltrials gov in 2019  CONCLUSIONS  Despite the pandemic affecting everyone  participation in early clinical research on the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric populations was concentrated in a few well-resourced institutions that were highly experienced in research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907433
3110,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a viral respiratory infection caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   While SARS-CoV-2 is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults  COVID-19 also affects newborn infants in nurseries and the Neonatal Intensive Care Units  NICUs   The majority of infected neonates are believed to acquire SARS-CoV-2 by horizontal transmission  and most of them have asymptomatic or mild symptomatic infections  In rare cases  infants with COVID-19 may have severe complications resulting in death  We report a case of COVID-19 in a premature neonate born at 34 weeks gestational age who presented with hypothermia and respiratory distress and subsequently developed clinical and radiological signs of necrotizing enterocolitis  NEC   The neonate received medical management  including antibiotics  suspension of gastric feeds  and intensive NICU support  The neonate s clinical condition improved without surgical intervention  and after 10 days of antibiotics and gradual reestablishment of gastric feeds  patient health condition returned to normal  and weeks later  he was discharged home  COVID-19 in infants is frequently asymptomatic or associated with mild disease  and in rare cases  it may be associated with severe gastrointestinal complications including NEC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956682
3401,Usage of disposable plastic products and disinfectants has been skyrocketing due to the COVID-19 pandemic  The random disposal of plastic products may result in greater microplastic pollution  Benzalkonium chloride is known as one of the most common ingredients of disinfectants  In this study  the adsorption behavior of benzalkonium chlorides  BAC12  BAC14  BAC16  on polyethylene microplastics  PE-MPs  and the combined toxic effects were investigated using batch adsorption experiment and Daphnia magna  The results showed that PE-MPs had strong adsorption capacity for BACs and the adsorption capacity increased  11 03-22 77 mg g -1   with their octanol-water distribution coefficients  The effect of pH was negligible while dissolved organic matter inhibited the adsorption  A slightly inverse relationship between particle size of PE-MPs and adsorption was observed  Additionally  the MP aging with UV H2O2 increased the adsorption of BAC12 but decreased that of relatively hydrophobic BAC14 and BAC16  The survival rate of Daphnia magna increased up to 100  in the presence of PE-MPs depending upon their adsorption capacities  suggesting that PE-MPs do not act as a carrier but rather as a scavenger for BACs  This study provides important information necessary for environmental risk assessment with regard to the combined pollution of MPs and toxic chemicals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952503
3995,COVID-19 is a global pandemic with a daily increasing number of affected individuals  Thrombosis is a severe complication of COVID-19 that leads to a worse clinical course with higher rates of mortality  Multiple lines of evidence suggest that hyperinflammation plays a crucial role in disease progression  This review compiles clinical data of COVID-19 patients who developed thrombotic complications to investigate the possible role of hyperinflammation in inducing hypercoagulation  A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed  Embase  Medline and Scopus to identify relevant clinical studies that investigated thrombotic manifestations and reported inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers in COVID-19 patients  Only 54 studies met our inclusion criteria  the majority of which demonstrated significantly elevated inflammatory markers  In the cohort studies with control  D-dimer was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with thrombosis as compared to the control  Pulmonary embolism  deep vein thrombosis and strokes were frequently reported which could be attributed to the hyperinflammatory response associated with COVID-19 and or to the direct viral activation of platelets and endothelial cells  two mechanisms that are discussed in this review  It is recommended that all admitted COVID-19 patients should be assessed for hypercoagulation  Furthermore  several studies have suggested that anticoagulation may be beneficial  especially in hospitalized non-ICU patients  Although vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved and distributed in several countries  research should continue in the field of prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and its severe complications including thrombosis due to the emergence of new variants against which the efficacy of the vaccines is not yet clear,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940978
6670,The COVID-19 pandemic has hit heavily many aspects of our lives  At this time  genomic research is concerned with exploiting available datasets and knowledge to fuel discovery on this novel disease  Studies that can precisely characterize the gene expression profiles of human hosts infected by SARS-CoV-2 are of significant relevance  However  not many such experiments have yet been produced to date  nor made publicly available online  Thus  it is of paramount importance that data analysts explore all possibilities to integrate information coming from similar viruses and related diseases  interestingly  microarray gene profile experiments become extremely valuable for this purpose  This chapter reviews the aspects that should be considered when integrating transcriptomics data  considering mainly samples infected by different viruses and combining together various data types and also the extracted knowledge  It describes a series of scenarios from studies performed in literature and it suggests possible other directions of noteworthy integration,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902130

2184,BACKGROUND  There is growing evidence that antibody responses play a role in the resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection  Patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency are at increased risk of persistent infection  This challenging clinical scenario is associated with adverse patient outcome and potentially creates an ecological niche for the evolution of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune evasion capacity  Case reports and or series have implied a therapeutic role for convalescent plasma  CP  to secure virological clearance  although concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of CP and its potential to drive viral evolution  and it has largely been withdrawn from clinical use in the UK  CASE PRESENTATION  We report two cases in which persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection was cleared following administration of the monoclonal antibody combination casirivimab and imdevimab  REGN-COV2  Ronapreve   A 55-year-old male with follicular lymphoma  treated with B cell depleting therapy  developed SARS-CoV-2 infection in September 2020 which then persisted for over 200 days  He was hospitalised on four occasions with COVID-19 and suffered debilitating fatigue and malaise throughout  There was no clinical response to antiviral therapy with remdesivir or CP  and SARS-CoV-2 was consistently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs  Intrahost evolution of several spike variants of uncertain significance was identified by viral sequence analysis  Delivery of REGN-COV2  in combination with remdesivir  was associated with clinical improvement and viral clearance within 6 days  which was sustained for over 150 days despite immunotherapy for relapsed follicular lymphoma  The second case  a 68-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on ibrutinib  also developed persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection  Despite a lack of response to remdesivir  infection promptly cleared following REGN-COV2 in combination with remdesivir  accompanied by resolution of inflammation and full clinical recovery that has been maintained for over 290 days  CONCLUSIONS  These cases highlight the potential benefit of REGN-COV2 as therapy for persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in antibody deficient individuals  including after failure of CP treatment  Formal clinical studies are warranted to assess the effectiveness of REGN-COV2 in antibody-deficient patients  especially in light of the emergence of variants of concern  such as Omicron  that appear to evade REGN-COV2 neutralisation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969393
7811,BACKGROUND  As leisure-one of the crucial life domains-was completely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic  our study aimed to investigate how adolescents spent their leisure time during the Spring 2020 lockdown  Secondly  we aimed to investigate the associations between the perceived changes in leisure time use  the leisure activities adolescents engaged in  and the associations with well-being during the Spring 2020 lockdown in Czechia  METHODS  Data from 3438 participants were included in this study  54 2  girls  mean age   13 45  SD   1 62   First  the initial number of items measuring leisure  electronic media use  and sports was reduced through Principal Component Analysis  PCA   Multivariate linear regression models tested the associations between leisure domains and mental well-being Results  The amount of leisure time  together with socially active leisure and sports and physical activity  formed the strongest positive predictors of mental well-being  whereas idle activities and time spent on electronic media acted as negative predictors  The amount of time spent doing schoolwork was unrelated to mental well-being  CONCLUSIONS  Overall  our results support the idea that leisure as a promoting factor for well-being is not just a matter of its amount but rather of engagement in meaningful and fulfilling activities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886538
1479,Boceprevir is an HCV NSP3 inhibitor that has been explored as a repurposed drug for COVID-19  It inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 main protease  M  Pro    and contains an alpha-ketoamide warhead  a P1 beta-cyclobutylalanyl moiety  a P2 dimethylcyclopropylproline  a P3 tert -butyl-glycine  and a P4 N -terminal tert -butylcarbamide  By introducing modifications at all four positions  we synthesized 20 boceprevir-based M  Pro  inhibitors including PF-07321332 and characterized their M  Pro  inhibition potency in test tubes   in vitro   and human host cells   in cellulo    Crystal structures of M  Pro  bound with 10 inhibitors and antiviral potency of 4 inhibitors were characterized as well  Replacing the P1 site with a beta- S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl -alanyl  opal  residue and the warhead with an aldehyde leads to high in vitro potency  The original moieties at P2  P3 and the P4 N -terminal cap positions in boceprevir are better than other tested chemical moieties for high in vitro potency  In crystal structures  all inhibitors form a covalent adduct with the M  Pro  active site cysteine  The P1 opal residue  P2 dimethylcyclopropylproline and P4 N -terminal tert -butylcarbamide make strong hydrophobic interactions with M  Pro    explaining high in vitro potency of inhibitors that contain these moieties  A unique observation was made with an inhibitor that contains an P4 N -terminal isovaleramide  In its M  Pro  complex structure  the P4 N -terminal isovaleramide is tucked deep in a small pocket of M  Pro  that originally recognizes a P4 alanine side chain in a substrate  Although all inhibitors show high in vitro potency  they have drastically different in cellulo potency in inhibiting ectopically expressed M  Pro  in human 293T cells  All inhibitors including PF-07321332 with a P4 N -terminal carbamide or amide have low in cellulo potency  This trend is reversed when the P4 N -terminal cap is changed to a carbamate  The installation of a P3 O-tert -butyl-threonine improves in cellulo potency  Three molecules that contain a P4 N -terminal carbamate were advanced to antiviral tests on three SARS-CoV-2 variants  They all have high potency with EC 50 values around 1 muM  A control compound with a nitrile warhead and a P4 N -terminal amide has undetectable antiviral potency  Based on all observations  we conclude that a P4 N -terminal carbamate in a boceprevir derivative is key for high antiviral potency against SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981058
696,The use of face masks outside the health care facility dates back a century ago  However  face masks use noticeably soared due to the COVID-19  Coronavirus disease 2019  pandemic  As a result  an unprecedented influx of discarded face masks is ending up in the environment  This review paper delves into face masks in the environment using the DPSIR  driving forces  pressures  states  impacts  and responses  framework to simplify and communicate the environmental indicators  Firstly  the historical  and briefly the economic trajectory of face masks are discussed  Secondly  the main driving forces of face masks use with an emphasis on public health are explored  Then  the pressures exerted by efforts to fulfill the human needs  driving forces  are explored  In turn  the state of the environment due to the influx of masks along with the impacts are examined  Furthermore  the upstream  and downstream societal responses to mitigate the environmental damages of the driving forces  pressures  states  and impacts are reviewed  In summary  it has been shown from this review that the COVID-19 pandemic has been causing a surge in face mask usage  which translates to face masks pollution in both terrestrial and aquatic environments  This implies proper usage and disposal of face masks is paramount to the quality of human health and the environment  respectively  Moreover  further research on eco-friendly face masks is indispensable to mitigating the environmental damages occurring due to the mass use of surgical masks worldwide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995587
2213,The development of safe and effective vaccines in a record time after the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is a remarkable achievement  partly based on the experience gained from multiple viral outbreaks in the past decades  However  the Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  crisis also revealed weaknesses in the global pandemic response and large gaps that remain in our knowledge of the biology of coronaviruses  CoVs  and influenza viruses  the 2 major respiratory viruses with pandemic potential  Here  we review current knowns and unknowns of influenza viruses and CoVs  and we highlight common research challenges they pose in 3 areas  the mechanisms of viral emergence and adaptation to humans  the physiological and molecular determinants of disease severity  and the development of control strategies  We outline multidisciplinary approaches and technological innovations that need to be harnessed in order to improve preparedeness to the next pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969061
2862,COVID-19 vaccines are indispensable  with the number of cases and mortality still rising  and currently no medicines are routinely available for reducing morbidity and mortality  apart from dexamethasone  although others are being trialed and launched  To date  only a limited number of vaccines have been given emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency  There is a need to systematically review the existing vaccine candidates and investigate their safety  efficacy  immunogenicity  unwanted events  and limitations  The review was undertaken by searching online databases  i e   Google Scholar  PubMed  and ScienceDirect  with finally 59 studies selected  Our findings showed several types of vaccine candidates with different strategies against SARS-CoV-2  including inactivated  mRNA-based  recombinant  and nanoparticle-based vaccines  are being developed and launched  We have compared these vaccines in terms of their efficacy  side effects  and seroconversion based on data reported in the literature  We found mRNA vaccines appeared to have better efficacy  and inactivated ones had fewer side effects and similar seroconversion in all types of vaccines  Overall  global variant surveillance and systematic tweaking of vaccines  coupled with the evaluation and administering vaccines with the same or different technology in successive doses along with homologous and heterologous prime-booster strategy  have become essential to impede the pandemic  Their effectiveness appreciably outweighs any concerns with any adverse events,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960133
3018,Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection causes systemic inflammation  cytokine storm and hypercytokinemia due to activation the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that have been associated with case-fatality rate  The immune overreaction and cytokine storm in the infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to NLRP3 inflammasome activation which has supreme importance in human innate immune response mainly against viral infections  In SARS-CoV-2 infection  NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in the stimulation and synthesis of natural killer cells  NKs   NFkappaB  and interferon gamma  INF-gamma   while inhibiting IL-33 expression  Various efforts have identified selective inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome  To achieve this  studies are exploring the screening of natural compounds and or repurposing of clinical drugs to identify potential NLRP3 inhibitors  NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors are expected to suppress exaggerated immune reaction and cytokine storm induced-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2 infection  Therefore  NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors could mitigate the immune-overreaction and hypercytokinemia in Covid-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957352

5400,RATIONALE  The impact of palliative care consultation on end-of-life care has not previously been evaluated in a multi-center study  OBJECTIVES  To evaluate the impact of palliative care consultation on the incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation  CPR  performed and comfort care received at the end-of-life in hospitalized patients with COVID-19  METHODS  We used the Society of Critical Care Medicine s COVID-19 registry to extract clinical data on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 31st  2020 to March 17th  2021 and died during their hospitalization  The proportion of patients who received palliative care consultation was assessed in patients who did and did not receive CPR  primary outcome  and comfort care  secondary outcome   Propensity matching was used to account for potential confounding variables  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS  3 227 patients were included in the analysis  There was no significant difference in the incidence of palliative care consultation between the CPR and no-CPR groups  19 9  vs  19 4   p   0 8334   Patients who received comfort care at the end-of-life were significantly more likely to have received palliative care consultation  43 3  vs  7 7   p < 0 0001   After propensity matching for comfort care on demographic characteristics and comorbidities  this relationship was still significant  43 2  vs  8 5   p < 0 0001   CONCLUSION  Palliative care consultation was not associated with CPR performed at the end-of-life but was associated with increased incidence of comfort care being utilized  These results suggest that utilizing palliative care consultation at the end-of-life may better align the needs and value of patients with the care they receive,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920014
2762,BACKGROUND  It is a matter of debate whether diabetes alone or its associated comorbidities are responsible for severe COVID-19 outcomes  This study assessed the impact of diabetes on intensive care unit  ICU  admission and in-hospital mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients  METHODS  A retrospective analysis was performed on a countrywide cohort of 40 632 COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 and March 2021  Data were provided by the Austrian data platform  The association of diabetes with outcomes was assessed using unmatched and propensity-score matched  PSM  logistic regression  RESULTS  12 2  of patients had diabetes  14 5  were admitted to the ICU  and 16 2  died in the hospital  Unmatched logistic regression analysis showed a significant association of diabetes  odds ratio  OR   1 24  95  confidence interval  CI   1 15-1 34  p < 0 001  with in-hospital mortality  whereas PSM analysis showed no significant association of diabetes with in-hospital mortality  OR  1 08  95 CI  0 97-1 19  p   0 146   Diabetes was associated with higher odds of ICU admissions in both unmatched  OR  1 36  95 CI  1 25-1 47  p < 0 001  and PSM analysis  OR  1 15  95 CI  1 04-1 28  p   0 009   CONCLUSIONS  People with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to ICU compared to those without diabetes  However  advanced age and comorbidities rather than diabetes itself were associated with increased in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960670
3033,Antimicrobials including antibiotics  antiparasitic  and antifungals  are subjected to resistance  In this context  Public Health Organizations called for a One Health approach because antimicrobials used to treat different infectious diseases in animals and plants may be the same than those used in humans  Whereas mechanisms of resistance transmission from animals or environment to humans should be considered differently if related to prokaryotic or eukaryotic pathogens  their impact can be considered as a whole  In that respect  we discussed the use of anti-parasitic in animals including anticoccidials  anthelmintics  and insecticides-acaricides  and the use of azoles in the environment that may both favor the development of drug resistance in humans  In light of the current situation  there is an urgent need for a transdisciplinary approach through anti-parasitic and antifungal stewardship programs in humans  animals  and environment  especially in the era of COVID-19 pandemic that will probably aggravate antimicrobial resistance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957316
744,BACKGROUND  As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the United States in the spring and summer of 2020  many organizations serving children and youth immediately faced significant operational and health care challenges  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance for the safe operation of youth programs emphasized the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs   yet few studies have examined NPI usage in summer programs such as camps  METHOD  This sequential-explanatory mixed-methods study explored the utilization of NPIs among camp health care providers who completed an online questionnaire followed by one-on-one interviews  RESULTS  The study findings indicated that camps consistently used a core set of NPIs to maintain and protect the health of camp participants  including screening  cohorting  hand hygiene  sanitizing practices  ventilation  and physical distancing  The study findings further identified specific practices of camp health care providers that made NPI utilization possible  as exemplified in the emergent themes of wellness promotion  health awareness and modeling  and camp health service mobilization  CONCLUSION  NPI usage benchmarks from this study  as well as effective practices for NPI utilization  can inform the application of NPIs and other health-promoting practices across diverse formal and informal youth settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994409
2304,We have previously reported that neoechinulin B  1a   a prenylated indole diketopiperazine alkaloid  shows antiviral activities against hepatitis C virus  HCV  via the inactivation of the liver X receptors  LXRs  and the resultant disruption of double-membrane vesicles  In this study  a two-step synthesis of the diketopiperazine scaffold of 1a was achieved by the base-induced coupling of 1 4-diacetyl-3-   tert-butyldimethylsilyl oxy methyl piperazine-2 5-dione with aldehydes  followed by the treatment of the resultant coupling products with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride  Compound 1a and its 16 derivatives 1b-q were prepared using this method  Furthermore  variecolorin H  a related alkaloid  was obtained by the acid treatment of 1a in MeOH  The antiviral evaluation of 1a and its derivatives revealed that 1a  1c  1d  1h  1j  1l  and 1o exhibited both anti-HCV and anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  activities  The results of this study indicate that the exomethylene moiety on the diketopiperazine ring is important for the antiviral activities  The antiviral compounds can inhibit the production of HCV and SARS-CoV-2 by inactivating LXRs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967639

4280,BACKGROUND  Performance of the SD Biosensor saliva antigen rapid test was evaluated at a large designated testing site in non-hospitalized patients  with or without symptoms  METHOD  All eligible people over 18 years of age presenting for a booked appointment at the designated SARS-CoV-2 testing site were approached for inclusion and enrolled following verbal informed consent  One nasopharyngeal swab was taken to carry out the default antigen rapid test from which the results were reported back to the patient and one saliva sample was self-taken according to verbal instruction on site  This was used for the saliva antigen rapid test  the RT-PCR and for virus culture  Sensitivity of the saliva antigen rapid test was analyzed in two ways  i  compared to saliva RT-PCR  and ii  compared to virus culture of the saliva samples  Study participants were also asked to fill in a short questionnaire stating age  sex  date of symptom onset  Recommended time of >  30mins since last meal  drink or cigarette if applicable was also recorded  The study was carried out in February-March 2021 for 4 weeks  RESULTS  We could include 789 people with complete records and results  Compared to saliva RT-PCR  overall sensitivity and specificity of the saliva antigen rapid test was 66 1  and 99 6  which increased to 88 6  with Ct <  30 cutoff  Analysis by days post onset did not result in higher sensitivities because the large majority of people were in the very early phase of disease ie <3 days post onset  When breaking down the data for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals  sensitivity ranged from 69 2  to 50  respectively  however the total number of RT-PCR positive asymptomatic participants was very low  n   5   Importantly  almost all culture positive samples were detected by the rapid test  CONCLUSION  Overall  the potential benefits of saliva antigen rapid test  could outweigh the lower sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal antigen rapid test in a comprehensive testing strategy  especially for home self-testing and in vulnerable populations like elderly  disabled or children where in intrusive testing is either not possible or causes unnecessary stress,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936659
2412,OBJECTIVES  To estimate occupational differences in COVID-19 mortality and test whether these are confounded by factors such as regional differences  ethnicity and education or due to non-workplace factors  such as deprivation or prepandemic health  METHODS  Using a cohort study of over 14 million people aged 40-64 years living in England  we analysed occupational differences in death involving COVID-19  assessed between 24 January 2020 and 28 December 2020 We estimated age-standardised mortality rates  ASMRs  per 100 000 person-years at risk stratified by sex and occupation  We estimated the effect of occupation on COVID-19 mortality using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for confounding factors  We further adjusted for non-workplace factors and interpreted the residual effects of occupation as being due to workplace exposures to SARS-CoV-2  RESULTS  In men  the ASMRs were highest among those working as taxi and cab drivers or chauffeurs at 119 7 deaths per 100 000  95  CI 98 0 to 141 4   followed by other elementary occupations at 106 5  84 5 to 132 4  and care workers and home carers at 99 2  74 5 to 129 4   Adjusting for confounding factors strongly attenuated the HRs for many occupations  but many remained at elevated risk  Adjusting for living conditions reduced further the HRs  and many occupations were no longer at excess risk  For most occupations  confounding factors and mediators other than workplace exposure to SARS-CoV-2 explained 70 -80  of the excess age-adjusted occupational differences  CONCLUSIONS  Working conditions play a role in COVID-19 mortality  particularly in occupations involving contact with patients or the public  However  there is also a substantial contribution from non-workplace factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965981
2880,The COVID-19 pandemic has increased food insecurity worldwide  yet there has been limited assessment of shifts in the cost and affordability of healthy  equitable and sustainable diets  This study explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and income supplements provided by the Australian government on diet cost and affordability for low-income households in an Australian urban area  The Healthy Diets ASAP method protocol was applied to assess the cost and cost differential of current and recommended diets before  in 2019  and during the COVID-19 pandemic  late 2020  for households with a minimum-wage and welfare-only disposable household income  by area of socioeconomic disadvantage  in Greater Brisbane  Queensland  Australia  Data were collected between August and October  2020  from 78 food outlets and compared with data collected in the same locations between May and October  2019  in an earlier study  The price of most healthy food groups increased significantly during the pandemic-with the exception of vegetables and legumes  which decreased  Conversely  the price of discretionary foods and drinks did not increase during the pandemic  The cost of the current and recommended diets significantly increased throughout this period  but the latter continued to be less expensive than the former  Due to income supplements provided between May and September 2020  the affordability of the recommended diet improved greatly  by 27  and 42   for households with minimum-wage and welfare-only disposable household income  respectively  This improvement in the affordability of the recommended diet highlights the need to permanently increase welfare support for low-income families to ensure food security,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959938

9587,Background  Persistent physical symptoms are common after a coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  episode  but their pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood  In this study  we aimed to explore the association between anxiety and depression at 1-month after acute infection and the presence of fatigue  dyspnea  and pain complaints at 3-month follow-up  Methods  We conducted a prospective study in patients previously hospitalized for COVID-19 followed up for 3 months  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  HAD-S  was administered by physicians at 1-month follow-up  and the presence of fatigue  dyspnea  and pain complaints was assessed at both 1 month and 3 months  Multivariable logistic regressions explored the association between anxiety and depression subscores and the persistence of each of the physical symptom at 3 months  Results  A total of 84 patients were included in this study  Median age  60 years  interquartile range  50 5-67 5 years  23 women   We did not find any significant interaction between anxiety and the presence of fatigue  dyspnea  or pain complaints at 1 month in predicting the persistence of these symptoms at 3 months  all p >   0 36   In contrast  depression significantly interacted with the presence of pain at 1 month in predicting the persistence of pain at 3 months  OR  1 60  95  CI  1 02-2 51  p   0 039   with a similar trend for dyspnea  OR  1 51  95  CI  0 99-2 28  p   0 052   Discussion and Conclusion  Contrary to anxiety  depression after an acute COVID-19 episode may be associated with and increased risk of some persistent physical symptoms  including pain and dyspnea,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858230
6039,SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus that depends on host factors for all stages of its life  Membrane receptor ACE2 is a well-established factor for SARS-CoV-2 docking  In addition to ACE2  whole-genome genetic screens have identified additional proteins  such as endosomal trafficking regulators SNX27 and retromer  as key host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection  However  it is poorly understood how SARS-CoV-2 utilize host endocytic transport pathways to produce productive infection  Here  we report that SNX27 interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein to facilitate S protein surface expression  Interestingly  S protein binds to the PDZ domain of SNX27  although it does not contain a PDZ-binding motif  PDZbm   Either abrogation of the SNX27 PDZ domain or S protein  MTSC  motif  which is critical for SNX27 binding  decreases surface expression of S protein and viral production  Collectively  our study highlights a novel approach utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate virion trafficking to establish virus infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909756
601,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is considered a global catastrophe that has overwhelmed health care systems  Since initiation of the pandemic  identification of characteristics that might influence risk of infection and poor disease outcomes have been of paramount interest  Blood group phenotypes are genetically inherited characteristics whose association with certain infectious diseases have long been debated  The aim of this review is to identify whether a certain type of blood group may influence an individual s susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing severe outcomes  Our review shows that blood group O protects individuals against SARS-CoV-2  whereas blood group A predisposes them to being infected  Although the association between blood groups and outcomes of COVID-19 is not consistent  it is speculated that non-O blood group carriers with COVID-19 are at higher risk of developing severe outcomes in comparison to O blood group  The interaction between blood groups and SARS-CoV-2 infection is hypothesized to be as result of natural antibodies against blood group antigens that may act as a part of innate immune response to neutralize viral particles  Alternatively  blood group antigens could serve as additional receptors for the virus and individuals who are capable of expressing these antigens on epithelial cells  which are known as secretors  would then have a high propensity to be affected by SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997677
6510,Commercial quail  Coturnix coturnix  farming has recently gained recognition from the South African poultry industry as a potential source of protein  which can be used to alleviate protein-energy malnutrition as well as food and nutrition insecurity in rural South Africa  Over six large-scale and hundred small-scale farmers are currently producing various quail breeds for commercial purposes in South Africa  However  these farmers face challenges of high feed costs  diseases  poor health care  low demand  for quail meat and eggs  and limited access to the markets  In addition  the lack of a pre-existing local market for quail meat and eggs has seen most farmers exporting these products to other countries  but with low profit margins owing to the slow growth experienced by world economies  Furthermore  the socio-economic crisis brought by the global Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has exacerbated these challenges as most of the countries enforced nationwide lockdown to mitigate the spread of the virus  Although this initiative was taken to save lives  it left quail farmers not knowing where to trade their stock due to large uncertainties in the social and economic domain  compounded by the fact that many South African citizens are traditionally accustomed to chicken products  Moreover  the size of the quail in relation to its market price when compared to that of chickens continues to lower its demand causing a lot of quail businesses to collapse  Thus  it is imperative to explore strategies that can reduce the cost of producing quail  while increasing their demand and popularity  Non-conventional feed ingredients and phytogenic feed additives that are inexpensive  locally available  and readily accessible should be identified and evaluated in quail diets to deliver sustainable production systems that will ensure that these birds continue to play a significant role in food and nutrition security of humans  In addition  extension service workers and quail farmers need to form a collaborative team to increase awareness about the benefits of quail products and build a long-lasting and profitable quail business  In this work  we present potential rearing methods for commercial quail production  nutritional benefits of quail products  as well as nutritional solutions for a sustainable and profitable quail business  Lastly  we review prospective awareness programs and marketing strategies that are aimed at successful commercialisation of quail using various networks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904054
6755,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic has forced nearly every nation around the world to implement border restrictions  some of which have prevented citizens from entering their own country  Restricting access to one s own country was a burdensome intervention  but may have been necessary given the global emergency  Thus  the decision restrict citizens  entry as a public health intervention warrants ethical analysis to determine its appropriateness  The focus of this paper is on the ethics of the 15-month border closure implemented in Trinidad and Tobago during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methodology  Ethical analysis of the COVID-19 border closure in Trinidad and Tobago was done using a six-part ethical framework for public health  Discussion  The ethical analysis highlights various areas of concern which question the justification for the border closure  The effectiveness  necessity and proportionality of the intervention were justified in the short-term  however  as benefits diminished over time  this did not result in appropriate policy changes  Continuous evaluation of the intervention throughout its use could have improved the balance of benefits and burdens thereby providing stronger ethical validation  Conclusion  The COVID-19 border closure in Trinidad and Tobago brought substantial burdens upon its citizens without comparable benefits  Data from previous pandemics and the best available data during the current pandemic showed that effectiveness was limited to the initial months  after which it would have been unnecessary to maintain  Thus  the government s decision to prolong the border closure for 15 months  well past its time of effectiveness  was not ethically justified from our analysis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901364
2513,Objectives  The goal of this study was to investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic has affected hip fracture care at a Level I Trauma hospital  The secondary goal was to summarize the published hip fracture reports during the pandemic  Design  A retrospective cohort study  Setting  Level I Trauma Center  Patients Participants  Eighty-six operatively treated hip fracture patients age >  65 years  occurring from January 17 to July 2  2020  Intervention if any  N A  Main Outcome Measurements  We defined 3 phases of healthcare system response  pre-COVID-19  period A   acute phase  period B   and subacute phase  period C   The primary outcome was 30-day mortality  Clinical outcomes including time to surgery  TTS  and length of stay  LOS  were extracted from the electronic medical record  Results  Twenty-seven patients from Period A  27 patients from Period B  and 32 patients from Period C were included  The 30-day mortality was not statistically different  The mean TTS was 20 0   - 14 3 hours and was the longest in Period C  22 1   - 9 8 hours   but the difference was not statistically significant  The mean LOS was 113 0   - 66 2 hours and was longest in Period B  120 9   - 100 6 hours   However  the difference was not statistically significant  Conclusions  The 30-day mortality  TTS  and LOS were not statistically different across multiple phases of pandemic at a level 1 trauma center  Our results suggest that we successfully adapted new protocol changes and continued to provide evidence-based care for hip fracture patients  Our results were comparable with that of other authors around the world,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964041

8668,BACKGROUND  Drug overdoses surged during the COVID-19 pandemic  underscoring the need for expanded and accessible substance use disorder  SUD  treatment  Relatively little is known about the experiences of patients receiving treatment during the pandemic  METHODS  We worked with 21 harm reduction and drug treatment programs in nine states and the District of Columbia from August 2020 to January 2021  Programs distributed study recruitment cards to clients  Clients responded to the survey by calling a study hotline and providing a unique study identification number  Our survey included detailed questions about use of SUD treatment prior to and since the COVID-19 pandemic  We identified settings where individuals received treatment and  for those treated for opioid use disorder  we examined use of medications for opioid use disorder  Individuals also reported whether they had received telehealth treatment and pandemic related treatment changes  e g   more take-home methadone   We calculated p-values for differences pre and since COVID-19  RESULTS  We interviewed 587 individuals of whom 316  53 8   were in drug treatment both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  Individuals in treatment reported substantial reductions in in-person service use since the start of the pandemic  including a 27 percentage point reduction  p< 001  in group counseling sessions and 28 percentage point reduction in mutual aid group participation  p< 001   By contrast  individuals reported a 21 percentage point increase in receipt of overdose education  p< 001   Most people receiving medications for opioid use disorder reported taking methadone and had high continuity of treatment  86 1  received methadone pre-COVID and 87 1  since-COVID  p  71   Almost all reported taking advantage of new policy changes such as counseling by video phone  increased take-home medication  or fewer urine drug screens  Overall  respondents reported relatively high satisfaction with their treatment and with telehealth adaptations  e g   80 2  reported  I m able to get all the treatment that I need    CONCLUSIONS  Accommodations to treatment made under the federal public health emergency appear to have sustained access to treatment in the early months of the pandemic  Since these changes are set to expire after the official public health emergency declaration  further action is needed to meet the ongoing need,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871945
5522,The COVID-19 disease is a multisystem disease due in part to the vascular endothelium injury  Lasting effects and long-term sequelae could persist after the infection and may be due to persistent endothelial dysfunction  Our study focused on the evaluation of endothelial quality index  EQI  by finger thermal monitoring with E4 diagnosis Polymath in a large cohort of long COVID-19 patients to determine whether long-covid 19 symptoms are associated with endothelial dysfunction  This is a cross-sectional multicenter observational study with prospective recruitment of patients  A total of 798 patients were included in this study  A total of 618 patients  77 4   had long COVID-19 symptoms  The mean EQI was 2 02   - 0 99 IC95   1 95-2 08   A total of 397  49 7   patients had impaired EQI  Fatigue  chest pain  and neuro-cognitive difficulties were significantly associated with endothelium dysfunction with an EQI <2 after adjustment for age  sex  diabetes  hypertension  dyslipidemia  coronary heart disease  and the severity of acute COVID-19 infection  In multivariate analysis  endothelial dysfunction  EQI <2   female gender  and severe clinical status at acute COVID-19 infection with a need for oxygen supplementation were independent risk factors of long COVID-19 syndrome  Long COVID-19 symptoms  specifically non-respiratory symptoms  are due to persistent endothelial dysfunction  These findings allow for better care of patients with long COVID-19 symptoms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917659
5564,The acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by an insult to the alveolar-capillary membrane  resulting in a marked reduction of aerated alveoli  increased vascular permeability and subsequent interstitial and alveolar pulmonary edema  reduced lung compliance  increase of physiological dead space  and hypoxemia  Most ARDS patients improve their systemic oxygenation  as assessed by the ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen and inspired oxygen fraction  with conventional intensive care and the application of moderate-to-high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure  However  in some patients hypoxemia persisted because the lungs are markedly injured  remaining unresponsive to increasing the inspiratory fraction of oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure  For decades  mechanical ventilation was the only standard support technique to provide acceptable oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal  Mechanical ventilation provides time for the specific therapy to reverse the disease-causing lung injury and for the recovery of the respiratory function  The adverse effects of mechanical ventilation are direct consequences of the changes in pulmonary airway pressures and intrathoracic volume changes induced by the repetitive mechanical cycles in a diseased lung  In this article  we review 14 major successful and unsuccessful randomized controlled trials conducted in patients with ARDS on a series of techniques to improve oxygenation and ventilation published since 2010  Those trials tested the effects of adjunctive therapies  neuromuscular blocking agents  prone positioning   methods for selecting the optimum positive end-expiratory pressure  after recruitment maneuvers  or guided by esophageal pressure   high-frequency oscillatory ventilation  extracorporeal oxygenation  and pharmacologic immune modulators of the pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in patients affected by ARDS  We will briefly comment physiology-based gaps of negative trials and highlight the possible needs to address in future clinical trials in ARDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916959
218,The evolution of rehabilitation treatments can be quantified through goniometric measurements  Thus  a video goniometer  and an app-based goniometry program can be both useful and a reliable method of obtaining a data base through which we can see if a certain rehabilitation treatment works out for our patients and during times such as the Covid-19 pandemic  a telemedicine approach can be done  Midstance is a sub-moment of the gait pattern  important in the stability of the lower limb  but that can also direct us towards a patient prone to falls  Osteoarthritis is a disease that causes high disability because of the cellular degradation that also affects normal gait  Four groups of subjects  subjects suffering from hip osteoarthritis  knee osteoarthritis  hip and knee osteoarthritis and control group  have been filmed and recorded their midstance joint range of motion in the Angles App  The dominant limb has been proven to have a more extended ankle in the hip osteoarthritis group  compared to knee osteoarthritis  hip and knee osteoarthritis or control group  Females have presented a more extended ankle  wearing high heels for a long period of time can be the cause of that  Subjects with knee osteoarthritis have presented a more flexed ankle in the dominant limb compared to the ones suffering from hip and knee osteoarthritis or control group  The ankle joint can also have its range of motion measured with a video goniometer  helping us compare results in between sessions of rehabilitation in osteoarthritic patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003772

7751,The constant emergence of COVID-19 variants reduces the effectiveness of existing vaccines and test kits  Therefore  it is critical to identify conserved structures in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  genomes as potential targets for variant-proof diagnostics and therapeutics  However  the algorithms to predict these conserved structures  which simultaneously fold and align multiple RNA homologs  scale at best cubically with sequence length and are thus infeasible for coronaviruses  which possess the longest genomes   approximately 30 000 nt  among RNA viruses  As a result  existing efforts on modeling SARS-CoV-2 structures resort to single-sequence folding as well as local folding methods with short window sizes  which inevitably neglect long-range interactions that are crucial in RNA functions  Here we present LinearTurboFold  an efficient algorithm for folding RNA homologs that scales linearly with sequence length  enabling unprecedented global structural analysis on SARS-CoV-2  Surprisingly  on a group of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes  LinearTurboFold s purely in silico prediction not only is close to experimentally guided models for local structures  but also goes far beyond them by capturing the end-to-end pairs between 5  and 3  untranslated regions  UTRs    approximately 29 800 nt apart  that match perfectly with a purely experimental work  Furthermore  LinearTurboFold identifies undiscovered conserved structures and conserved accessible regions as potential targets for designing efficient and mutation-insensitive small-molecule drugs  antisense oligonucleotides  small interfering RNAs  siRNAs   CRISPR-Cas13 guide RNAs  and RT-PCR primers  LinearTurboFold is a general technique that can also be applied to other RNA viruses and full-length genome studies and will be a useful tool in fighting the current and future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887342
61,People with prediabetes are at risk for type 2 diabetes  They may discount the future delay discounting  DD   and not engage in preventive health behaviors  Episodic future thinking  EFT  can reduce DD when future scenarios are cued  but research is needed to assess long-term effects of EFT and when EFT is not cued  This study tested EFT training compared to control for people with prediabetes enrolled in a 6-month weight loss program on DD  weight  HbA1c  and physical activity  Results showed a reliable EFT effect on reducing DD in cued  p   0 0035   and uncued DD tasks  p   0 048   and significant overall changes in weight  p < 0 001   HbA1c  p  0 001  and physical activity  p   0 003   but no significant differences in these outcomes by group  p s > 0 05   Sixty-eight percent of the sample ended below the prediabetes HbA1c range  These results suggest that DD can be modified over extended periods  and the effects of EFT can be observed without EFT cues  However  these data do not suggest that changes in weight  HbA1c or physical activity were due to EFT training  The study was initiated before the COVID-19 pandemic which provided the opportunity to compare differences for people treated in-person or remotely  Analyses showed no differences in DD  weight  HBA1c or physical activity outcomes were observed between in-person and remote treatment  suggesting telehealth is a scalable approach to treating prediabetes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006500
5593,Single-domain Variable New Antigen Receptors  VNARs  from the immune system of sharks are the smallest naturally occurring binding domains found in nature  Possessing flexible paratopes that can recognize protein motifs inaccessible to classical antibodies  VNARs have yet to be exploited for the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics  Here  we detail the identification of a series of VNARs from a VNAR phage display library screened against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain  RBD   The ability of the VNARs to neutralize pseudotype and authentic live SARS-CoV-2 virus rivalled or exceeded that of full-length immunoglobulins and other single-domain antibodies  Crystallographic analysis of two VNARs found that they recognized separate epitopes on the RBD and had distinctly different mechanisms of virus neutralization unique to VNARs  Structural and biochemical data suggest that VNARs would be effective therapeutic agents against emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutants  including the Delta variant  and coronaviruses across multiple phylogenetic lineages  This study highlights the utility of VNARs as effective therapeutics against coronaviruses and may serve as a critical milestone for nearing a paradigm shift of the greater biologic landscape,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916516

5137,The tourism sector has been deeply ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic as many individuals abstained entirely from travel  Thus  before contemplating the trajectory of the sector s recovery  it is essential to understand individuals  travel intentions both during and after the pandemic  The present study contributes in this regard by examining the impact of individuals  personality traits categorised by the five-factor model  or the Big Five  on their leisure travel intentions during and after the pandemic  To this end  we utilised an artificial neural network  ANN  approach to analyse 500 responses from individuals residing in Japan  The results reveal that extraversion has the strongest relative influence on intentions to travel during the pandemic  whereas openness to experience has the strongest influence on travel intentions after the pandemic  This study is the first of its kind to examine the influence of the Big Five personality traits on travel intentions in the context of a pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924646
5231,It is well-known that the Coronavirus Disease 2019  which is caused by the beta-coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS-CoV-2   emerged in December 2019 followed by an outbreak first reported in Wuhan  China  Thus far  vaccination appears to be the only way to bring the pandemic to an end  In the present study  immunogenicity data was evaluated using LIAISON R  SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay  DiaSorin S p A  among a sample of 52 vaccinated healthcare workers  five of whom were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 47 who were seronegative  over a time span of <  90 days following the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine  The test detects antibodies against the Trimeric complex  S1  S2 and receptor binding domain   The overall mean value of the serum levels of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 30 days following the second dose of the vaccine was 1 901 8 binding arbitrary unit  BAU  ml  after 60 days the mean value declined to 1 244 9 BAU ml  The antibody levels then reached a plateau  as confirmed by the antibody test carried out 90 days following the second dose  which revealed a mean value of 1 032 4 BAU ml  P<0 0001   A higher level was observed at all three times in male subjects compared with female subjects  and in younger male participants compared with female participants  although these differences did not reach a statistically significant level  Similarly  no significant difference was found in antibody values at different times according to age  After the second dose of the vaccine  two subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2  and an increase in antibody values in the third assay was observed in both individuals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923323
6006,Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 evolution in specific geographies may help predict the properties of variants coming from these regions  We mapped neutralization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain that evolved over 6 months from the ancestral virus in a person with advanced HIV disease  Infection was before the emergence of the Beta variant first identified in South Africa  and the Delta variant  We compared early and late evolved virus to the ancestral  Beta  Alpha  and Delta viruses and tested against convalescent plasma from ancestral  Beta  and Delta infections  Early virus was similar to ancestral  whereas late virus was similar to Beta  exhibiting vaccine escape and  despite pre-dating Delta  strong escape of Delta-elicited neutralization  This example is consistent with the notion that variants arising in immune-compromised hosts  including those with advanced HIV disease  may evolve immune escape of vaccines and enhanced escape of Delta immunity  with implications for vaccine breakthrough and reinfections  Highlights  A prolonged ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection pre-dating the emergence of Beta and Delta resulted in evolution of a Beta-like serological phenotypeSerological phenotype includes strong escape from Delta infection elicited immunity  intermediate escape from ancestral virus immunity  and weak escape from Beta immunityEvolved virus showed substantial but incomplete escape from antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 vaccination  Graphical abstract,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909798
2034,This pilot project investigated environmental SARS-CoV-2 presence in seven Midwestern meatpacking plants from May 2020 to January 2021  This study investigated social distancing and infection control practices and incorporated environmental sampling of surfaces and air in employee common areas  All plants increased their social distancing efforts  increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting worker areas  and screened for symptomatic people to prevent entry into the workplace  575 samples from common areas were collected and evaluated with RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2  42 367 surface samples were positive  while no virus was detected in air samples  Case positive data from the counties surrounding each plant showed peak positive SARS-CoV-2 cases from 12-55 days before the virus was detected in the plant  indicating that environmental sampling is likely a lagging indicator of community and plant infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972125
6323,Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies  nAbs  are key biomarkers considered to be associated with vaccine efficacy  In United States government-sponsored phase 3 efficacy trials of COVID-19 vaccines  nAbs are measured by two different validated pseudovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays  with each trial using one of the two assays  Here we describe and compare the nAb titers obtained in the two assays  We observe that one assay consistently yielded higher nAb titers than the other when both assays were performed on the World Health Organization s anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin International Standard  COVID-19 convalescent sera  and mRNA-1273 vaccinee sera  To overcome the challenge this difference in readout poses in comparing combining data from the two assays  we evaluate three calibration approaches and show that readouts from the two assays can be calibrated to a common scale  These results may aid decision-making based on data from these assays for the evaluation and licensure of new or adapted COVID-19 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907214

3053,In response to the COVID-19 pandemic  Taiwan has been one of the best performers in the world with extremely low infections and deaths  This success can be attributed to the long experiences dealing with natural disasters and communicable diseases  However  with different disastrous characteristics  the disaster management systems for communicable diseases and natural disasters are very different in terms of laws  plans  frameworks  and emergency operations  Taking the response to COVID-19 pandemic as a study subject  we found that disaster management for communicable diseases can be improved through a comparison with natural disasters  and vice versa  First  having wider and longer impacts than natural disasters  the plans and framework for communicable diseases in Taiwan focus more on national and regional scales  Local governments would need more capacity support including budgets and training to conduct investigations and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic  Second  for quick response  the emergency operation for communicable diseases was designed to be more flexible than that for natural disasters by giving the commander more authority to adjust to the circumstances  The commanding system requires a more objective consultation group to prevent arbitrary decisions against the COVID-19 pandemic  Finally  risk governance is important for communicable diseases as well as for natural disasters  Additional efforts should be made to enhance vulnerability assessment  disaster reduction  and risk communication for shaping responses and policies in an efficient and coordinating way,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957028
2728,Several cases of naturally infected dogs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  have been reported despite the apparently low susceptibility of this species  Here  we document the first reported case of infection caused by the Delta  B 1 617 2  variant of concern  VOC  in a dog in Spain that lived with several household members suffering from Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019  COVID-19   The animal displayed mild digestive and respiratory clinical signs and had a low viral load in the oropharyngeal swab collected at the first sampling  Whole-genome sequencing indicated infection with the Delta variant  coinciding with the predominant variant during the fifth pandemic wave in Spain  The dog seroconverted  as detected 21 days after the first sampling  and developed neutralizing antibodies that cross-neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 variants  This study further emphasizes the importance of studying the susceptibility of animal species to different VOCs and their potential role as reservoirs in the context of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960795
376,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic claimed millions of lives and caused unprecedented disruptions  Despite these negative impacts  there is optimism the pandemic may shift public opinion on other global crises by fostering a sense of collective efficacy  Using propensity score matching to compare New Zealanders assessed before  n  12 304  and after  n   12 370  nationwide lockdowns in 2020  we tested a preregistered mediation model with COVID-19 lockdown experience predicting increases in pro-environmental attitudes via enhanced socio-political efficacy  As hypothesized  socio-political efficacy increased after the successful nationwide lockdowns  In turn  socio-political efficacy amplified respondents  pro-environmental attitudes including climate beliefs and concern  as well as support for a government subsidy for public transport and opposition to government spending on new motorways  The pandemic also enhanced respondents  satisfaction with the quality of the natural environment  which was unmediated by socio-political efficacy  The crisis might offer an opportunity to foster collective pro-environmental actions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002011
3813,In critically ill patients  liver dysfunction often results in coagulopathy and encephalopathy and is associated with high mortality  Extracorporeal clearance of hepatotoxic metabolites  including bilirubin and ammonia  aims to attenuate further hepatocyte damage and liver injury  resulting in decreased mortality  The efficacy of hemadsorption combined with conventional hemodialysis to eliminate bilirubin and ammonia to support the liver s excretory function in acute liver injury has been described previously  However  the optimal use of liver support systems in chronic liver dysfunction due to secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients  SSC-CIP  has not been defined yet  We herein describe the kinetics of successful bilirubin and ammonia elimination by hemadsorption in a patient with SSC-CIP after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO  therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   During the course of the disease  the patient developed laboratory signs of liver injury during ECMO therapy before clinically detectable jaundice or elevated bilirubin levels  A diagnosis of SSC-CIP was confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  ERCP  based on intraductal filling defects in the intrahepatic bile ducts due to biliary casts  The patient showed stable elevations of bilirubin and ammonia levels thereafter  but presented with progressive nausea  vomiting  weakness  and exhaustion  Based on these laboratory findings  hemadsorption was combined with hemodialysis treatment and successfully eliminated bilirubin and ammonia  Moreover  direct comparison revealed that ammonia is more efficiently eliminated by hemadsorption than bilirubin levels  Clinical symptoms of nausea  vomiting  weakness  and exhaustion improved  In summary  bilirubin and ammonia were successfully eliminated by hemadsorption combined with hemodialysis treatment in SSC-CIP following ECMO therapy and severe COVID-19  This observation is particularly relevant since it has been reported that a considerable subset of critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffer from liver dysfunction associated with high mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34944657
1467,COVID-19 has affected billions of people around the world directly or indirectly  The response to the pandemic has focused on preventing the spread of the disease and improving treatment options  Diagnostic technologies have played a key role in this response since the beginning of the pandemic  As vaccines and other treatments have been developed and deployed  interest in understanding and measuring the individual level of immune protection has increased  Historically  use of antibody titers to measure systemic immunity has been constrained by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between antibodies and immunity  the lack of international standards for antibody concentration to enable cross-study comparisons  and insufficient clinical data to allow for the development of robust antibody-immunity models  However  these constraints have recently shifted  With a deeper understanding of antibodies  the promulgation of WHO antibody standards  and the development of immunity models using datasets from multiple COVID-19 vaccine trials  certain types of quantitative antibody tests may now provide a way to monitor individual or community immunity against COVID-19  Specifically  tests that quantitate the concentration of anti-RBD IgG -antibodies that target the receptor binding domain of the S1 spike protein component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - show promise as a useful and scalable measure of the COVID-19 immunity of both individuals and communities  However  to fulfill this promise  a rapid and easy-to-administer test is needed  To address this important clinical need  Brevitest deployed its point-of-care-capable technology platform that can run a rapid  <15 minute   quantitative antibody test with a sample of 10 mul of whole blood from a fingerstick  The test we validated on this platform measures the concentration of anti-RBD IgG in Binding Antibody Units per milliliter  BAU mL  per WHO Reference Standard NIBSC 20 136  In this paper  we present studies used to characterize the Brevitest anti-RBD IgG assay and evaluate its clinical performance  lower limits of measurement  precision  linearity  interference  and cross-reactivity  The results demonstrate the ability of this assay to measure a patient s anti-RBD IgG concentration  This information  together with models developed from recent COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials  can provide a means of assessing the current level of immune protection of an individual or community against COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981070

7364,OBJECTIVES  To evaluate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on body composition among patients with rheumatoid arthritis  RA   METHODS  A total 102 patients with RA were enrolled  We examined muscle mass  fat-free mass index  FFMI  and fat mass index  FMI  values using bioelectrical impedance analysis between November 2019 and January 2020  for the first measurement  and September 2020 and January 2021  for the second measurement   RESULTS  The muscle mass was significantly decreased from a median of 34 6 kg at the first measurement to a median of 33 9 kg at the second measurement  p   0 002   The FFMI was significantly decreased from a median of 15 3 at the first measurement to a median of 14 8 at the second measurement  p   0 011   CONCLUSIONS  The present study reveals that muscle mass and FFMI decreased among patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894260
5300,BACKGROUND  Simulation-based education has become the most important part of resident training in anesthesiology  especially during the pandemic  It allows learning the skills and the management of different situations without putting residents in risk of contamination  considering COVID-19 is highly contagious  The hypothesis was that simulation is still associated with improvement of knowledge acquisitions despite the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  Residents of anesthesiology and intensive care subjected to an anaphylaxis simulation scenario  Their knowledge levels were assessed by true false questions before and one month after the simulation session  The STAI test was used to measure anxiety levels before and after the scenario  Data were analyzed statistically using Wilcoxon and Mc Nemar tests  RESULTS  Junior residents  < 2 years  received significantly higher scores in post-training theoretical tests compared to their pre-training scores  79 2   - 9 6  84 5   - 8 2  p 0 002  n 21   There was no difference between pre and post-test scores of seniors  80 2   - 9  81 8   - 10 4  p 0 3   Pre- and post-anxiety inventory scores were nearly the same and both were in the moderate group  39 8   - 10 1  39 3   - 12 1  p 0 8   CONCLUSION  Simulation-based education improved the knowledge levels of the residents without raising anxiety levels  Thus  simulation-based training showed its value as an important tool of education during the pandemic  which needs to be further popularized for training at all institutions  Enlightening medical educators about this accomplished teaching method may lead to improved quality of medical education in developing countries and reshape how tomorrow s doctors are trained during pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921904
8993,COVID-19-specific vaccines are efficient prophylactic weapons against SARS-CoV-2 virus  However  boosting innate responses may represent an innovative way to immediately fight future emerging viral infections or boost vaccines  MV130 is a mucosal immunotherapy  based on a mixture of whole heat-inactivated bacteria  that has shown clinical efficacy against recurrent viral respiratory infections  Herein  we show that the prophylactic intranasal administration of this immunotherapy confers heterologous protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in susceptible K18-hACE2 mice  Furthermore  in C57BL 6 mice  prophylactic administration of MV130 improves the immunogenicity of two different COVID-19 vaccine formulations targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike  S  protein  inoculated either intramuscularly or intranasally  Independently of the vaccine candidate and vaccination route used  intranasal prophylaxis with MV130 boosted S-specific responses  including CD8   -T cell activation and the production of S-specific mucosal IgA antibodies  Therefore  the bacterial mucosal immunotherapy MV130 protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection and improves COVID-19 vaccines immunogenicity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867974
8305,PURPOSE  To investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown had an impact on the extent of cancer disease at FDG PET CT staging as surrogate marker  METHODS  Retrospective observational study including cancer patients submitted to FDG PET CT staging from June 1 to October 31  2020  and June 1 to October 31  2019  respectively  Data regarding primary tumour  nodal  N  status and number of involved nodal stations  and presence and number of distant metastases  M  were collected  Each scan was classified in limited vs advanced status  Data were aggregated across the study population and tumour type  Bi-weekly frequencies of the observed events were analysed  RESULTS  Six hundred eleven patients were included  240 in 2019 vs 371 in 2020  respectively   A significant increase of advanced disease patients  rate 1 56  P < 0 001   N   or M   patients  rate 1 84 and 2 09  respectively  P < 0 001   and patients with a greater number of involved N stations or M  rate 2 01 and 2 06  respectively  P < 0 001  were found in 2020 compared with data of 2019  Analysis by tumour type showed a significant increase of advanced disease in lymphoma and lung cancer in 2020 compared with 2019  P < 0 001   In addition  a significant increase of nodal involvement was found in lung  gastro-intestinal  and breast cancers  as well as in lymphoma patients  P < 0 02   A significant increase of distant metastases was found in lung cancers  P   0 002   CONCLUSION  Cancer patients with advanced disease at FDG PET CT staging increased in 2020 compared with 2019  following the national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic  1 5-fold with a significant increase of patients with N or M involvement  Targeted health interventions are needed to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on patient outcome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877609
1805,Background With tuberculosis  TB  being among the top 13 leading cause of death and second leading infectious disease killer next to COVID-19 globally  there is a need for continued study and a better understanding of the risk factors and management approaches  One in five tuberculosis  TB  deaths occurs in individuals who have contracted human immunodeficiency virus  HIV   However  other risk factors play a role in its morbidity pattern  Therefore  descriptions of these comorbidities between TB  HIV  and other risk factors such as diabetes are needed  Method A retrospective  descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of TB and its relationship with some risk factors  HIV  diabetes  race  ethnicity  end-stage renal disease  post-organ transplant  recent contact with active TB  and other non-HIV immunosuppressive conditions  using data from three South Florida counties  Dade  Broward  and Palm Beach  from 2010 to 2019 retrieved from the CDC s Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis  RVCT   Results A total of 2437 cases of TB were reported between 2010 and 2019  There was approximately a 14  positive rate among the three counties for HIV  In contrast  47  of the individuals with active TB in all three counties were also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus  An average of 25  of the active TB cases in these counties had a concurrent immunosuppressive condition other than HIV  Known contact with another active TB case was an identified risk factor in 18   17   and 29  of reported TB cases in Dade  Broward  and Palm Beach counties  respectively  Discussion The HIV status of patients with TB in these three counties was predominantly negative  in contrast to initial theories  The presence of diabetes mellitus was associated with a diagnosis of TB or latent tuberculosis infection  LTBI  within the studied population  Conclusion Screening for latent tuberculosis infection  LTBI   compliance  and promotion of LTBI management in newly diagnosed and uncontrolled diabetics may be a successful prevention strategy for this high-risk group,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976484
4404,Objective  Covid19 has emerged as a greatest threat of the decade worldwide  At present there is no certain treatment for treating coronavirus diseases  while some antiviral drugs  Remdesivir   Lopinavir and Ritonavir  are under investigation  Many countries including India have adopted the convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of moderate to severely ill patients  Despite the treatment being given  there are no such evidences on the utility and efficacy of convalescent plasma  Hence this study tries to find out the impact on the discharge status from hospital of the patients receiving the very therapy  Design  Systematic review and meta analysis  Setting  An extensive search was made  following PRISMA guidelines on online databases such as Pubmed  Google scholar and Science direct  Studies those fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria  were included and reviewed and analyzed for a common outcome discharge status   Participants  A total of 6 eligible studies were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively which included three case control  two case series and one case report  Results  The overall pooled discharge rate from the above studies was 75 7  after the CP therapy  When analyzed for relative risk   it showed CP therapy having a lower risk of staying in hospital  not getting discharged  when compared to Standard therapy  overall RR  relative risk  being 0 946  Conclusion  Our study shows that there is always a higher rate of discharge and low risk of prolonged hospital stay in those patients who receive plasma therapy  CP therapy being a low cost and easy to administer therapy with very less adverse events  requires more focus on further research as it has a potential to become an ideal effective treatment option for COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934695

4156,We report on the onset of minimal change disease  MCD  presenting with anasarca after a second dose of the messenger RNA  mRNA -based Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   A 75-year-old previously healthy male was admitted with rapidly progressive anasarca and proteinuria of 7 7 g day following the second dose  A kidney biopsy revealed MCD with nephrotic syndrome  He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone  leading to complete remission after 35 days in the hospital  Since definite causality between the vaccine and MCD remains unclear  awareness of this potential adverse effect of mRNA vaccines is important to determine its true incidence and frequency,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938534
3937,BACKGROUND  The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has brought an unprecedented focus on public attitudes to vaccines  with intention to accept a COVID-19 vaccine fluctuating during the pandemic  However  it is unclear how the pandemic may influence attitudes and behaviour in relation to vaccines in general  The aim of the current study is to examine older adults  changes in vaccination attitudes and behaviour over the first year of the pandemic  METHODS  In February-March 2020  before the first COVID-19 national lockdown in the UK   372 older adults  aged 65   provided sociodemographic information  self-reported influenza vaccine uptake  and completed two measures of vaccination attitudes  the 5C scale and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination Scale  One-year later  following rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to older adults  participants provided information on their COVID-19 and influenza vaccine uptake in the previous 12 months  and completed the 5C and VAX scales again  Paired samples t-tests were used to examine changes in vaccination attitudes over time  RESULTS  Almost all participants  98 7   had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine  and a significant increase in influenza uptake was identified  83 6  in 2020 to 91 6  in 2021   Complacency  mistrust of vaccine benefit  concerns about commercial profiteering  and constraints to vaccination had significantly decreased between Time 1 and Time 2  and collective responsibility had significant increased  However  calculation and worries about unforeseen future effects had increased  indicating that participants now perceived higher risks related to vaccination and were taking a more deliberative information-seeking approach  CONCLUSION  The results show significant changes in vaccination attitudes across the pandemic  These changes suggest that while older adults became less complacent about the importance of vaccines  concerns about potential risks associated with vaccination increased  It will be important for public health communication to address these concerns for all vaccines offered to this group,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941951
6227,Coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19  hit the world in December 2019  and only less than 5  of the 15 million cases were recorded in Africa  A major call for concern was the significant rise from 2  in May 2020 to 4 67  by the end of July 15  2020  This drastic increase calls for quick intervention in the transmission and control strategy of COVID-19 in Africa  A mathematical model to theoretically investigate the consequence of ignoring asymptomatic cases on COVID-19 spread in Africa is proposed in this study  A qualitative analysis of the model is carried out with and without re-infection  and the reproduction number is obtained under re-infection  The results indicate that increasing case detection to detect asymptomatically infected individuals will be very effective in containing and reducing the burden of COVID-19 in Africa  In addition  the fact that it has not been confirmed whether a recovered individual can be re-infected or not  then enforcing a living condition where recovered individuals are not allowed to mix with the susceptible or exposed individuals will help in containing the spread of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908633
4355,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  has rapidly spread and resulted in the global pandemic of COVID-19  Although IgM IgG serology assay has been widely used  with the entire spike or nucleocapsid antigens  they only indicate the presence or absence of antibodies against these proteins but are not specific to the neutralization antibodies  therefore providing only generic information about infection stage and possible future immune protection  Novel technologies enabling easy-to-use and sensitive detection of multiple specific antibodies simultaneously will facilitate precise diagnosis of infection stage  prediction of clinical outcomes  and evaluation of future immune protection upon viral exposure or vaccination  Here  we demonstrate a rapid and ultrasensitive quantification method for epitope-specific antibodies  including different isotypes and subclasses  in a multiplexed manner  Using an ultrabright fluorescent nanolabel  plasmonic-fluor  this novel assay can be completed in 20 min and more importantly  the limit of detection of the plasmon-enhanced immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is as much as 100-fold lower compared to the assays relying on enzymatic amplification of colorimetric signals  Using convalescent patient plasma  we demonstrate that this biodetection method reveals the patient-to-patient variability in immune response as evidenced by the variations in whole protein and epitope-specific antibodies  This cost-effective  rapid  and ultrasensitive plasmonically enhanced multiplexed epitope-specific serological assay has the potential to be broadly employed in the detection of specific antibodies  which may benefit the advanced epidemiology studies and enable improvement of the clinical outcomes and prediction of the future protection against the SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935364
3143,When the history of the COVID-19 pandemic is written  it is likely to show that the mental models held by scientists sometimes facilitated their thinking  thereby leading to lives saved  and at other times constrained their thinking  thereby leading to lives lost  This paper explores some competing mental models of how infectious diseases spread and shows how these models influenced the scientific process and the kinds of facts that were generated  legitimized and used to support policy  A central theme in the paper is the relative weight given by dominant scientific voices to probabilistic arguments based on experimental measurements versus mechanistic arguments based on theory  Two examples are explored  the cholera epidemic in nineteenth century London-in which the story of John Snow and the Broad Street pump is retold-and the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and early 2021-in which the evidence-based medicine movement and its hierarchy of evidence features prominently  In each case  it is shown that prevailing mental models-which were assumed by some to transcend theory but were actually heavily theory-laden-powerfully shaped both science and policy  with fatal consequences for some,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956591
6085,Background  We evaluated clinical outcomes  functional burden  and complications 1 month after coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  infection in a prospective US Military Health System  MHS  cohort of active duty  retiree  and dependent populations using serial patient-reported outcome surveys and electronic medical record  EMR  review  Methods  MHS beneficiaries presenting at 9 sites across the United States with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  test  a COVID-19-like illness  or a high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure were eligible for enrollment  Medical history and clinical outcomes were collected through structured interviews and International Classification of Diseases-based EMR review  Risk factors associated with hospitalization were determined by multivariate logistic regression  Results  A total of 1202 participants were enrolled  There were 1070 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 132 SARS-CoV-2-negative participants  In the first month post-symptom onset among the SARS-CoV-2-positive cases  there were 212 hospitalizations  80  requiring oxygen  20 ICU admissions  and 10 deaths  Risk factors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization included race  increased for Asian  Black  and Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic White   age  age 45-64 and 65  compared with <45   and obesity  BMI>  30 compared with BMI<30   Over 2  of survey respondents reported the need for supplemental oxygen  and 31  had not returned to normal daily activities at 1 month post-symptom onset  Conclusions  Older age  reporting Asian  Black  or Hispanic race ethnicity  and obesity are associated with SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization  A proportion of acute SARS-CoV-2 infections require long-term oxygen therapy  the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on short-term functional status was substantial  A significant number of MHS beneficiaries had not yet returned to normal activities by 1 month,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909439
3942,There has been resistance to COVID-19 public health restrictions partly due to changes and reductions in work  resulting in financial stress  Psychological reactance theory posits that such restrictions to personal freedoms result in anger  defiance  and motivation to restore freedom  In an online study  N   301   we manipulated the target of COVID-19 restrictions as impacting self or community  We hypothesized that  a  greater pandemic-related financial stress would predict greater reactance   b  the self-focused restriction condition would elicit greater reactance than the community-focused restriction condition   c  reactance would be greatest for financially-stressed individuals in the self-focused condition  and  d  greater reactance would predict lower adherence to social distancing guidelines  Independent of political orientation and sense of community  greater financial stress predicted greater reactance only in the self-focused condition  the community-focused condition attenuated this association  Additionally  greater reactance was associated with lower social distancing behavior  These findings suggest that economic hardship exacerbates negative responses to continued personal freedom loss  Community-focused COVID-19 health messaging may be better received during continued pandemic conditions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941891
7472,The recent COVID-19 pandemic has further high-lighted the need for improving tele-rehabilitation systems  One of the common methods is to use wearable sensors for monitoring patients and intelligent algorithms for accurate and objective assessments  An important part of this work is to develop an efficient evaluation algorithm that provides a high-precision activity recognition rate  In this paper  we have investigated sixteen state-of-the-art time-series deep learning algorithms with four different architectures  eight convolutional neural networks configurations  six recurrent neural networks  a combination of the two and finally a wavelet-based neural network  Additionally  data from different sensors  combinations and placements as well as different pre-processing algorithms were explored to determine the optimal configuration for achieving the best performance  Our results show that the XceptionTime CNN architecture is the best performing algorithm with normalised data  Moreover  we found out that sensor placement is the most important attribute to improve the accuracy of the system  applying the algorithm on data from sensors placed on the waist achieved a maximum of 42  accuracy while the sensors placed on the hand achieved 84   Consequently  compared to current results on the same dataset for different classification categories  this approach improved the existing state of the art accuracy from 79  to 84   and from 80  to 90  respectively,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891733
8980,Young workers in Spain face the unprecedented impact of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 crisis in short sequence  Moreover  they have also experienced a deterioration in their employment and earnings over the last three decades  In this paper  we document this evolution and adopt a longitudinal approach to show that employment and earnings losses suffered by young workers during recessions are not made up in the subsequent expansions  We also estimate the size of the scarring effects of entering the job market in a recession for college-educated workers during their first decade in the labor market  Our empirical estimates indicate that while there is some evidence of scarring effects  the driving force is a trend worsening of youth labor market outcomes  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s13209-021-00244-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868384
2246,On July 12  2021  the California Department of Public Health updated COVID-19 school guidance  allowing a Test to Stay  TTS  strategy to increase access to in-person learning   1   The TTS strategy enabled unvaccinated students  exposed in school to a person infected with SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes COVID-19   to remain in school while under quarantine  if both the infected person and the exposed person wore masks correctly and consistently throughout the exposure  To stay in school during the quarantine period  the exposed student must remain asymptomatic  wear a mask at school  and undergo twice weekly testing for SARS-CoV-2  To date  few studies have evaluated the impact of TTS on transmission  2-4   This study evaluated a TTS strategy implemented by Los Angeles County Department of Public Health  LAC DPH   During September 20-October 31  2021  among 78 school districts  one half permitted TTS  in total  432  21   of 2 067 schools adopted TTS  TTS schools did not experience increases in COVID-19 incidence among students after TTS implementation  and in 20 identified outbreaks in TTS schools  dagger  no tertiary transmission was identified  The ratio of student COVID-19 incidence in TTS districts to that in non-TTS districts was similar before and after TTS adoption  rate ratio   0 5   Non-TTS schools lost an estimated 92 455 in-person school days during September 20-October 31 while students were in quarantine  compared with no lost days among quarantined students in TTS schools  Non-TTS schools cited resource-related reasons for not adopting TTS  75  of these schools were in LAC s most disadvantaged neighborhoods  Preliminary data from LAC suggest that a school-based TTS strategy does not increase school transmission of SARS-CoV-2  and might greatly reduce loss of in-person school days  however  TTS might have barriers to implementation and require resources that are not available for some schools  Continued efforts to simplify school quarantine strategies might help to ensure that all students have access to safe in-person education  Although vaccination remains the leading public health recommendation to protect against COVID-19 for persons aged >  5 years  schools might consider TTS as an option for allowing students with a school exposure who are not fully vaccinated to remain in the classroom as an alternative to home quarantine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968371
9053,Background  The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is extremely variable  Thus  it is likely that the heterogeneity in the genetic make-up of the host may contribute to disease severity  Toll-like receptor  TLR -4 plays a vital role in the innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection  The susceptibility of humans to severe COVID-19 concerning TLR-4 single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  has not been well examined  Objective  The goal of this research was to investigate the association between TLR-4  Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile  SNPs and COVID-19 severity and progression as well as the cytokine storm in Egyptian patients  Methods  We genotyped 300 adult COVID-19 Egyptian patients for TLR-4  Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile  SNPs using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism  PCR-RFLP   We also measured interleukin  IL -6 levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  as an indicator of the cytokine storm  Results  The minor 299Gly  G  and 399Ile  T  alleles were associated with a significant  P < 0 001  positive risk of severe COVID-19  OR   3 14  95  CI   2 02-4 88 and OR   2 75  95  CI   1 66-4 57   their frequency in the severe group were 71 8   84 150  and 70 7   58 150   respectively  We detected significant differences between TLR-4  Asp299Gly  Thr399Ile  genotypes with regard to serum levels of IL-6  Levels of IL-6 increased significantly with the presence of the mutant 299Gly  G  and 399Ile  T  alleles to reach the highest levels in the Gly299Gly  GG  and the Ile399Ile  TT  genotypes  170 pg mL  145-208 25  and 112 pg mL  24-284 75   respectively   Conclusion  The TLR-4  Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile  minor alleles 299Gly  G  and 399Ile  T  are associated with COVID-19 severity  mortality  and the cytokine storm,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866927

2807,Introduction  The immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with inflammatory bowel disease  IBD  on biologic therapies is not well studied  The goal of this study was to measure the serological response to BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines in patients with IBD receiving different biologic therapies  Methods  We performed a multi-center prospective study between 1 August 2021 and 15 September 2021  We measured the seropositivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies  SARS-CoV-2 IgG  and neutralizing antibody concentrations in patients with IBD receiving biologic therapies 4-10 weeks after their second dose or 3-6 weeks after their first dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines  Results  A total of 126 patients were enrolled  mean age  31 years  60  male  71  Crohn s disease  29  ulcerative colitis   Of these  92 patients were vaccinated with the BNT162b2 vaccine  73   and 34 patients with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine  27    In patients being treated with infliximab and adalimumab  the proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving two doses of the vaccine were 44 out of 59 patients  74 5   and 13 out of 16 patients  81 2    respectively  In contrast  of those receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab  the proportion of patients who achieved positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels after receiving two doses of the vaccine were 100  and 92 8   respectively  In patients receiving infliximab and adalimumab  the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels after two-dose vaccination was 40 out of 59 patients  67 7   and 14 out 16 patients  87 5    respectively  On the other hand  the proportion of patients who had positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels were 12 out of 13 patients  92 3   and 13 out of 14 patients  92 8   in patients receiving ustekinumab and vedolizumab  respectively  Conclusions  The majority of patients with IBD who were on infliximab  adalimumab  and vedolizumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination  All patients on ustekinumab seroconverted after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  The BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are both likely to be effective after two doses in patients with IBD on biologics  Larger follow-up studies are needed to evaluate if decay of antibodies occurs over time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960217
5133,The COVID-19 pandemic and associated government-mandated shutdowns disrupted schooling  socialization  and family life for school-aged children during spring 2020  These disruptions may have contributed to increased child behavior problems  Thus  we examined behavior problems in 247 children aged 7 to 9years during Ohio s shutdown period  We investigated whether differences in parent-reported child behavior problems were associated with concurrent parent distress during spring 2020 and or children s social-emotional skills measured via teacher-reports from the previous year  spring 2019   Parent distress significantly predicted behavior problems  such that more distressed parents also reported more child behavior problems  Child pre-pandemic peer social skills also significantly predicted behavior problems  such that more skilled children exhibited fewer behavior problems  There were no interaction effects between parent distress and children s social-emotional skills on child behavior problems  Further research is needed to understand how children s social-emotional skills impact their ability to cope during times of epidemiological crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924662
8518,OBJECTIVE  Most patients infected with the novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2   as the causative agent of COVID-19 disease  show mild symptoms  but some of them develop severe illness  The purpose of this study was to analyze the blood markers of COVID-19 patients and to investigate the correlation between serum inflammatory cytokines and the disease severity  METHODS  In this prospective cross-sectional study  50 patients with COVID-19 and 20 patients without COVID-19 were enrolled  According to ICU admission criteria  patients were divided into two groups of non-severe and severe  Differences in the serum levels of C-reactive protein  CRP   IL-6  and TNF-alpha  as well as erythrocyte sedimentation rate  ESR   lymphocytes  LYM  count  and neutrophils  NEU  count between the two groups were determined and analyzed  RESULTS  Out of the 50 patients with COVID-19  14 were diagnosed as severe cases  There was no significant difference between the two groups of COVID-19 patients in terms of gender and age  Blood tests of COVID-19 patients showed a significant decrease and increase in NEU and LYM counts  respectively  There were significant differences in the serum levels of IL-6  TNF-alpha  and CRP between the severe and non-severe groups  which were higher in the severe group  Also  there was a significant correlation between the disease severity and CRP with ESR  r   0 79   CRP with IL-6  r   0 74   LYM with NEU  r   -0 97   and ESR with TNF-alpha  r   0 7   CONCLUSION  The findings of this study  as the first study in Iran  suggest that the levels of IL-6  TNF-alpha  ESR  and CRP could be used to predict the severity of COVID-19 disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874079
8610,We hypothesized that cross-protection from seasonal epidemics of human coronaviruses  HCoVs  could have affected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  transmission  including generating reduced susceptibility in children  To determine what the prepandemic distribution of immunity to HCoVs was  we fitted a mathematical model to 6 y of seasonal coronavirus surveillance data from England and Wales  We estimated a duration of immunity to seasonal HCoVs of 7 8 y  95  CI 6 3 to 8 1  and show that  while cross-protection between HCoV and SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the age distribution  it is insufficient to explain the age pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the first wave of the pandemic in England and Wales  Projections from our model illustrate how different strengths of cross-protection between circulating coronaviruses could determine the frequency and magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics over the coming decade  as well as the potential impact of cross-protection on future seasonal coronavirus transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873059

7516,The importance of implementing new methodologies to study the ever-increasing amount of Covid-19 data is apparent  The aftermath analysis of these data could inform us on how specific political decisions influenced the dynamics of the pandemic outbreak  In this paper we use the Italian outbreak as a case study  to study six different Covid indicators collected in twenty Italian regions  We define a new object  the Covidome  to investigate the network of functional Covid interactions between regions  We analyzed the Italian Covidome over the course of 2020  and found that Covid connectivity between regions follows a sharp North-South community gradient  Furthermore  we explored the Covidome dynamics and individuated differences in regional Covid connectivity between the first and second waves of the pandemic  These differences can be associated to the two different lockdown strategies adopted for the first and the second wave from the Italian government  Finally  we explored to what extent Covid connectivity was associated with the Italian geographical network  and found that Central regions were more tied to the structural constraints than Northern or Southern regions in the spread of the virus  We hope that this approach will be useful in gaining new insights on how political choices shaped Covid dynamics across nations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890442
5594,The global disruption caused by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic stressed the supply chain of many products  including pharmaceuticals  Multiple drug repurposing studies for COVID-19 are now underway  If a winning therapeutic emerges  it is unlikely that the existing inventory of the medicine  or even the chemical raw materials needed to synthesize it  will be available in the quantities required  Here  we utilize retrosynthetic software to arrive at alternate chemical supply chains for the antiviral drug umifenovir  as well as eleven other antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs  We have experimentally validated four routes to umifenovir and one route to bromhexine  In one route to umifenovir the software invokes conversion of six C-H bonds into C-C bonds or functional groups  The strategy we apply of excluding known starting materials from search results can be used to identify distinct starting materials  for instance to relieve stress on existing supply chains,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916512
8576,We present a Letter to the Editor in response to the article by Chinsky et al  titled  Medical Student Perspectives on Their Role as Emerging Physicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic   The authors highlighted that a greater proportion of preclinical students felt more obligated to volunteer in the context of healthcare staff shortages  compared to clinical students  As final year medical students  we propose additional reasons based on our personal experiences that may contribute to clinical students feeling less inclined to volunteer during the pandemic  Specifically  we believe that the priorities of clinical students may affect their willingness to volunteer given the challenge of balancing private study and clinical placement  Furthermore  we believe that the psychological difficulties that often accompany clinical placement may affect clinical students  views on volunteering  We also briefly outline solutions that may solve these issues  Ultimately  positive attitudes in students need to be sustained throughout the medical degree so that the future generation of doctors is better equipped to face a future crisis and beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873495
1754,Background  Students act as messengers in delivering effective messages for better uptake of health-promoting behavior  Understanding their knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   intentions to use the COVID-19 vaccine  and its associated factors will help develop promising strategies in vaccine promotion concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among students in the healthcare and non-healthcare sectors to assess their intentions to get vaccinated against the COVID-19  A non-probability snowball sampling technique was used to recruit study participants  N   655  through social media platforms and emails  Study participants were recruited across the country  including six major geographical regions  Eastern  Western  Northern  Southern  North-east  and Central  in India between November 2020 and January 2021 before the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine  Descriptive statistics were used to present the sociodemographic  and vaccine-related behaviors of the study participants  Key determinants that likely predict vaccine acceptance among students were modeled using logistic regression analysis  For each analysis  p < 0 05 was considered significant  Results  A total of 655 students were recruited  323 from healthcare and 332 from non-healthcare sectors  to assess their intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine  Of the 655 students  63 8  expressed intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine  The acceptance was higher among non-healthcare students  54 07 vs  45 93    At the time of the study  27 8  of the students indicated that they had been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient  A vast majority  93 4   of the students knew about the COVID-19 virus  and most  89 3   of them were aware of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine  The history of vaccine hesitancy was found to be low  17 1    Only one-third  33 4   of the students showed concern about contracting COVID-19  Trust in the healthcare system  adjusted odds ratio  aOR   4 13   95  CI  2 83-6 04   p < 0 00  and trust in domestic vaccines  aOR  1 46   95  CI  1 02-2 08   p < 0 05  emerged as the significant predictors of student s intention to get vaccinated  Higher acceptance for vaccine was observed among students in the non-healthcare  aOR  1 982  95  CI  1 334-2 946  p < 0 00   Conclusion  This study shows that the Indian college students had relatively high levels of positive intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines  although about one-third were not sure or unwilling to receive the vaccine  highlighting possible vaccine hesitancy  Informational campaigns and other strategies to address vaccine hesitancy are needed to promote uptake of COVID-19 vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976911
5900,BACKGROUND  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has spread worldwide  and the vaccine remains the ultimate cornerstone to overcoming its long-term impact  Vaccine hesitancy might obstruct the effort to achieve herd immunity and eradicate the virus  We assessed Saudi Arabian individuals  willingness  beliefs  and barriers regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and their adherence to preventive measures during and after the pandemic  METHODS  A self-administered electronic validated questionnaire was distributed among the five major regions in Saudi Arabia between November and December 2020  The questionnaire addressed the sociodemographic data  beliefs  potential barriers  parents  acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination for their children  and adherence to protective measures during and after the pandemic  RESULTS  Of 8 056 participants  4 218  52 4   of a non-representative sample were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19  Being a young adult  male  having less than a high school degree  being a smoker  having a chronic disease  and having a history of seasonal influenza vaccine uptake were positive predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance  Hesitant participants reported concerns about vaccine side effects and safety as the main barriers to accepting the COVID-19 vaccine  Some refusers  26 1   declared that they would reconsider vaccination only if the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine were reported by more studies  CONCLUSIONS  Our study revealed a promising willingness to accept the vaccine among the population  with positive beliefs and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination  However  a considerable proportion of the population was reluctant to accept the vaccine  Thus  publicly providing information about vaccine safety and implementing health education programs is crucial for increasing the public s confidence in the vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34911441
8876,Background  High intensity of ventilation has an association with mortality in patients with acute respiratory failure  It is uncertain whether similar associations exist in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  patients due to coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   We investigated the association of exposure to different levels of driving pressure  DeltaP  and mechanical power  MP  with mortality in these patients  Methods  PRoVENT-COVID is a national  retrospective observational study  performed at 22 ICUs in the Netherlands  including COVID-19 patients under invasive ventilation for ARDS  Dynamic DeltaP and MP were calculated at fixed time points during the first 4 calendar days of ventilation  The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality  To assess the effects of time-varying exposure  Bayesian joint models adjusted for confounders were used  Results  Of 1 122 patients included in the PRoVENT-COVID study  734 were eligible for this analysis  In the first 28 days  29 2  of patients died  A significant increase in the hazard of death was found to be associated with each increment in DeltaP  HR 1 04  95  CrI 1 01-1 07  and in MP  HR 1 12  95  CrI 1 01-1 36   In sensitivity analyses  cumulative exposure to higher levels of DeltaP or MP resulted in increased risks for 28-day mortality  Conclusion  Cumulative exposure to higher intensities of ventilation in COVID-19 patients with ARDS have an association with increased risk of 28-day mortality  Limiting exposure to high DeltaP or MP has the potential to improve survival in these patients  Clinical Trial Registration  www ClinicalTrials gov  identifier  NCT04346342,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869421
8793,The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 as an atypical type of viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Many potential pharmacotherapies are currently being investigated against this disease  This article points to and justifies  the importance of investigating the potential therapeutic value of pharmacological agents acting on Toll-like Receptor  TLR  7 and or TLR8 as double-edged swords combating COVID-19  Induction of TLR7 and or TLR8 may be investigated as a strategy to stimulate immunity and may be added to anti-COVID19 vaccines to cope with their current viral escape challenge  TLR7 stimulation may not only help viral clearance through Th1 antiviral responses but may also provide beneficial broncho- and vaso-dilatory  as well as  anti-inflammatory effects  Pharmacological compounds acting as TLR7 and or TLR8 agonists may be of value if used by frontline healthcare workers with comorbidities who demonstrate mild symptoms of the disease  On the other hand  TLR7 and or TLR8 antagonists may be used in combination with immune-modulatory anti-inflammatory drugs in severe cases of the disease  with potential synergistic effects that could also help in reducing the doses of such therapies  and consequently their adverse effects,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870161

4983,Background  Systemic inflammation has been associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  disease and mortality  Hyponatremia can result from inflammation due to non-osmotic stimuli for vasopressin production  Methods  We prospectively studied 799 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 7 and November 7  2020  at Hospital Posadas in Buenos Aires  Argentina in order to evaluate the association between hyponatremia  inflammation  and its impact on clinical outcomes  Admission biochemistries  high-sensitivity C-reactive protein  hsCRP   ferritin  patient demographics  and outcome data were recorded  Outcomes  within 30 days after symptoms  evaluated included ICU admission  mechanical ventilation  dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury  AKI   and in-hospital mortality  Length of hospital stay  in days  were evaluated using comprehensive data from the EHR  Results  Hyponatremia  median Na   133 mmol L  was present on admission in 366  45 8    Hyponatremic patients had higher hsCRP  median 10 3  IR 4 8-18 4  mg dl vs  6 6  IR 1 6-14 0  mg dl  p < 0 01  and ferritin levels  median 649  IQR 492-1 168  ng dl vs  393  IQR 156-1 440  ng dl  p   0 02  than normonatremic patients  Hyponatremia was associated with higher odds of an abnormal hsCRP  unadjusted OR 5 03  95 CI  2 52-10 03   and remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders  adjusted OR 4 70  95 CI  2 33-9 49   p < 0 01   Hyponatremic patients had increased mortality on unadjusted  HR 3 05  95 CI  2 14-4 34  and adjusted  HR 2 76  95 CI 1 88-4 06  in Cox proportional hazard models  Crude 30-day survival was lower for patients with hyponatremia at admission  mean  SD  survival 22 1  0 70  days  compared with patients who were normonatremic  mean  SD  survival 27 2  0 40  days  p < 0 01   Conclusion  Mild hyponatremia on admission is common  is associated with systemic inflammation and is an independent risk factor for hospital mortality  Clinical Trial Registration  www ClinicalTrials gov  identifier NCT04493268,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926496
5384,The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for reliable and accurate diagnostic tools that provide quantitative results at the point of care  Real-time RT-PCR requires large laboratories  a skilled workforce  complex and costly equipment  and labor-intensive sample processing  Despite tremendous efforts  scaling up RT-PCR tests is seemingly unattainable  To date  hundreds of millions of COVID-19 tests have been performed globally  but the demand for timely  accurate testing continues to outstrip supply  Antigen-based rapid diagnostic testing is emerging as an alternative to RT-PCR  However  the performance of these tests  namely their sensitivity  is still inadequate  To overcome the limitations of currently employed diagnostic tests  new tools that are both sensitive and scalable are urgently needed  We have developed a miniaturized electrochemical biosensor based on the integration of specific monoclonal antibodies with a biochip and a measurement platform  and applied it in the detection of Spike S1 protein  the binding protein of SARS-CoV-2  Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy  quantitative detection of sub-nanomolar concentrations of Spike S1 was demonstrated  exhibiting a broad detection range  To demonstrate the applicability of the biosensor  we have further developed a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus based on Spike protein-pseudo-typed VSV platform  Specific detection of different concentrations of pseudovirus particles was feasible in <30 min  This new tool may largely contribute to the fight against COVID-19 by enabling intensive testing to be performed and alleviating most of the hurdles that plague current diagnostics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920254
3979,ABSTRACT  Hospital-wide screenings for coronavirus disease  COVID-19  are important to identify healthcare workers at risk of exposure  However  the currently available diagnostic tests are expensive or only identify past infection  Therefore  this single-center observational study aimed to assess the positivity rate of hospital-wide antigen screening tests for COVID-19 and evaluate clinical factors associated with antigen positivity during a COVID-19 institutional outbreak in Sapporo  Japan We analyzed the data of 1615 employees who underwent salivary or nasal swab antigen tests on November 18  2020  to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Laboratory confirmation using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed for those with positive viral serology  The demographic characteristics  job titles  and risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were compared between employees with and without COVID-19 A total of 19 employees  1 2   tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen  The positivity rate was high among rehabilitation therapists  2 1   and employees in the low-risk contact group  6 1    Although there was no association between the job titles and the seropositivity rate  those in the low-risk contact group had an increased risk of testing positive for the viral antigen  odds ratio  8 67  95  confidence interval  3 30-22 8  The antigen positivity rate was low during the hospital outbreak  suggesting that risk assessment of exposure to COVID-19 patients may provide more useful information than using job titles to identify infected health care providers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941176
4222,OBJECTIVE  The object of this study was to examine the accuracy in pre-hospital shock index  SI  for predicting intensive care unit  ICU  requirement and 30-day mortality among from COVID-19 patients transported to the hospital by ambulance  METHOD  All consecutive patients who were the age >  18 years  transported to the emergency department  ED  by ambulance with a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the pre-hospital frame were included in the study  Four different cut-off points were compared  0 7  0 8  0 9  and 1 0  to examine the predictive performance of both the mortality and ICU requirement of the SI  The receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curve and the area under the curve  AUC  was employed to evaluate each cut-off value discriminatory for predicting 30-day mortality and ICU admission  RESULTS  The total of 364 patients was included in this study  The median age in the study population was 69  55-80   of which 196 were men and 168 were women  AUC values for 30-day mortality outcome were calculated as 0 672  0 674  0 755  and 0 626  respectively  for threshold values of 0 7  0 8  0 9 and 1 0  ICU admission was more likely for the patients with pre-hospital SI> 0 9  Similarly  the mortality rate was higher in patients with pre-hospital SI> 0 9  CONCLUSION  Early triage of COVID-19 patients will ensure efficient use of healthcare resources  The SI could be a helpful  fast and powerful tool for predicting mortality status and ICU requirements of adult COVID-19 patients  It was concluded that the most useful threshold value for the shock index in predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients is 0 9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937595
2682,Over the last few decades  several emerging or reemerging viral diseases with no readily available vaccines have ravaged the world  A platform to fastly generate vaccines inducing potent and durable neutralizing antibody and T cell responses is sorely needed  Bioinformatically identified epitope-based vaccines can focus on immunodominant T cell epitopes and induce more potent immune responses than a whole antigen vaccine and may be deployed more rapidly and less costly than whole-gene vaccines  Increasing evidence has shown the importance of the CD4  T cell response in protection against HIV and other viral infections  The previously described DNA vaccine HIVBr18 encodes 18 conserved  promiscuous epitopes binding to multiple HLA-DR-binding HIV epitopes amply recognized by HIV-1-infected patients  HIVBr18 elicited broad  polyfunctional  and durable CD4   and CD8  T cell responses in BALB c and mice transgenic to HLA class II alleles  showing cross-species promiscuity  To fully delineate the promiscuity of the HLA class II vaccine epitopes  we assessed their binding to 34 human class II  HLA-DR  DQ  and -DP  molecules  and immunized nonhuman primates  Results ascertained redundant 100  coverage of the human population for multiple peptides  We then immunized Rhesus macaques with HIVBr18 under in vivo electroporation  The immunization induced strong  predominantly polyfunctional CD4  T cell responses in all animals to 13 out of the 18 epitopes  T cells from each animal recognized 7-11 epitopes  Our results provide a preliminary proof of concept that immunization with a vaccine encoding epitopes with high and redundant coverage of the human population can elicit potent T cell responses to multiple epitopes  across species and MHC barriers  This approach may facilitate the rapid deployment of immunogens eliciting cellular immunity against emerging infectious diseases  such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961636
749,The world continues to be in the midst of a distressing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2   a novel virus with multiple antigenic systems  The virus enters via nasopharynx  oral and infects cells by the expression of the spike protein  and enters the lungs using the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor  The spectrum of specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is increasingly challenging as frequent mutations have been reported and their antigen specificity varies accordingly  The development of monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  will have a more significant advantage in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 virus infectivity  Recently  mAbs have been developed to target specific neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection  The use of the therapeutic index of mAbs that can elicit neutralization by binding to the viral spike protein and suppress the cytokine network is a classic therapeutic approach for a potential cure  The development of mAbs against B-cell function as well as inhibition of the cytokine network has also been a focus in recent research  Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mAbs as antibody cocktail preparations against SARS-CoV-2 infection  Target specific therapeutic accomplishment with mAbs  a milestone in the modern therapeutic age  can be used to achieve a specific therapeutic strategy to suppress SARS-CoV-2 virus infection  This review focuses on the molecular aspects of the cytokine network and antibody formation to better understand the development of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994337
2522,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  emerged in China in December 2019  Healthcare workers  HCWs  are one of the high-risk groups of infection and knowledge of the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among this class is very important  not only to understand the spread of COVID-19 among health institutions but also to assess the success of public health interventions  The objective of this prospective study was to determine the seroprevalence of COVID-19 immunoglobulin G  IgG  antibodies after vaccine administration and assess the symptomatology associated with the number of IgG antibodies  A total of 75 HCWs from an intensive care unit were studied three and six months after the second administration of the COVID-19 vaccine  They were divided into three groups  IgG antibodies between 4 160 and 6 350  group one   greater than 6 350  group two   and less than 4 160  group three   After the first administration of the vaccine  80  had symptoms in both groups one and two  whereas only 13 8  had symptoms in group three  After the second dose of the vaccine  all elements of group one and 80  of group two developed symptoms  but only 40  of group three manifested symptoms  With the exception of one  all professionals showed a decrease in the number of IgG antibodies from three to six months  Our findings show that professionals with a higher number of IgG antibodies had more symptoms and that these rapidly declined over the three-to-six-month period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963873
480,In this review  we outlined the clinical studies in critical care field of pulmonary medicine from November 1  2020 to September 30  2021  A Chinese retrospective study for critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed that corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduced 28-day mortality in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype  In hospitalized patients with COVID-19  the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization  and early sedation with dexmedetomidine exhibited a high probability of reduced 90-day mortality in older patients regardless of operative or non-operative cluster status  High-flow nasal cannula  HFNC  improved the prognosis compared with conventional oxygen therapy in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  AECOPD  patients with acute compensated hypercapnic respiratory failure  For COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory failure with HFNC therapy  awake prone positioning reduces the incidence of treatment failure and the need for intubation  Compared with pressure-volume curve guiding positive end-expiratory pressure  PEEP  titration for acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  patients  PEEP titration guided with EIT  Electrical impedance tomography  might be associated with improved driving pressure and survival rate  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO  is a life-saving therapy for severe ARDS patients  but the survival among ECMO-assisted patients with COVID-19 is strongly associated with a centre s experience in ECMO during the previous year and early ECMO management  Compared to conventional lung-protective mechanical ventilation  MV   neurally adjusted ventilatory assist  NAVA  decreased duration of MV  These findings also provide evidence for improving the clinical management in critical care of pulmonary medicine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000311

3785,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  primarily affects the lungs  causing respiratory symptoms  However  the infection clearly affects all organ systems including the gastrointestinal system  Acute pancreatitis associated with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has been widely reported Recent studies have discussed pancreatic compromise incidentally in asymptomatic patients  or in a form of clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain  nausea  or vomiting  which is further reflected in some cases with abnormal serum lipase and amylase levels It was suggested that upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II cell receptors or inflammatory cytokines play a major role in predisposing pancreatic injury in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients To date  there is insufficient data to establish the causality of acute pancreatitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected cases  In this paper  we organize recent studies conducted to observe the frequency of acute pancreatitis associated with COVID-19 cases while highlighting present hypotheses  predisposing factors  and their effect on the outcome  and point to gaps in our knowledge,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945198
527,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE  Newly created midwifery bachelor programmes attract an increasing number of applicants  Hence  educators have moved away from traditional non-standardised selection methods and started developing new tools for the admission of students  Researchers have expressed concerns around the validity of such selection measures and their ability to identify the appropriate candidates  The objective of this study was to develop and implement selection procedures for a new midwifery Bachelor of Science degree in Hamburg  Germany  and assess their psychometric properties  DESIGN  This is a mixed-methods longitudinal study on the reliability  validity and acceptability of newly developed selection criteria  SETTING  The newly established midwifery bachelor of science in Hamburg  Germany  PARTICIPANTS  Upon completion of their online application  all midwifery applicants were invited by email to participate in our research project and thereby informed of its purpose and voluntary nature of their participation  The total number of candidates who took the test was 366  of which 309 agreed to take part in this study  Sixty-five applicants were eventually admitted to the midwifery Bachelor programme  of which 59 were included in the study  MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS  We developed two tests for cognitive ability  HAM-Mid I and II  and adapted one test for personal and professional characteristics  Casper - Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics   Due to the Covid pandemic  we implemented the tests online instead of on site as initially planned  HAM-Mid I had the lowest  Cronbach s Alpha   0 38  whereas Casper had the highest internal consistency  Cronbach s Alpha   0 77  of all three tests  Age  previous academic achievement and native tongue were significantly associated with applicants  performance on HAM-Mid II and Casper admission tests  HAM-Mid II was associated with students  performance in the first year midwifery exam  r   0 31  p < 0 05   Overall evaluation of HAM-Mid II and Casper was good while HAM-Mid I received a more negative feedback  KEY CONCLUSIONS  Evidence on the reliability and predictive validity of the newly developed tests suggests that the applied admission criteria are appropriate for an objective selection of bachelor midwifery students  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE  The interests of university and clinical stakeholders of a midwifery bachelor degree can be represented through the development of tests for the assessment of cognitive ability and personal and professional characteristics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999513
9857,PURPOSE  Prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection is obtained with nasopharyngeal swabs  By the way  there is no consensus regarding sampling in totally laryngectomized subjects  who thus breathe directly by the tracheostomy and  theoretically  may be infected in the trachea   The aim of this study is to evaluate possible differences between swab results in the trachea and in the nasopharynx of this category of patients  METHODS  A retrospective chart review was performed in April 2021 among patients who previously had been operated on for total laryngectomy and who underwent swabs for SARS-CoV-2 research in 3 health-care centers in Northern-Eastern Italy  Data regarding the site of swabbing  trachea or nasopharynx  were analyzed  A comprehensive review of the literature regarding the same topic was then performed  RESULTS  A total of 25 totally laryngectomized subjects underwent swabs  Among them  5 tested positive in the trachea  1  and in the nasopharynx  4   According to the literature review  4 more subjects tested positive in the trachea  1  and in the nasopharynx  3   Data were overall divergent and no statistically significant correlations emerged between results of the tests performed in the two sites  CONCLUSION  Due to these discrepancies  both tracheal and nasopharyngeal swabs are recommended in these kinds of patients  to obtain a reliable test and to avoid false negatives,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853865
5058,Aims  In this particular study  we report our experience of eight doctors infected with SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the probability of in-hospital virus transmission to patients or the rest of the hospital personnel  The importance of PPEs is highlighted  Materials and methods We explore the data of eight doctors who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after returning from their summer vacation  More specific  we evaluated the time they spent working before they got tested after their return  the symptoms they developed and the results of their tracking through their patients and the rest of hospital workers  Results All doctors followed their working schedule  ranging from 2-4 days after their summertime off  without knowledge of being infected  They had been keeping all suggested protection precautions  while no further virus transmission to patients and or other healthcare workers occurred  even though they had close contact and cooperation with many of them  Conclusions Our experience suggests that  if healthcare workers conform to established safety procedures  the likelihood of further transmission both to patients and their colleagues  even in asymptomatic state  appears to be minimal,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925599
6481,Macrodomains are a class of conserved ADP-ribosylhydrolases expressed by viruses of pandemic concern  including coronaviruses and alphaviruses  Viral macrodomains are critical for replication and virus-induced pathogenesis  therefore  these enzymes are a promising target for antiviral therapy  However  no potent or selective viral macrodomain inhibitors currently exist  in part due to the lack of a high-throughput assay for this class of enzymes  Here we developed a high-throughput ADP-ribosylhydrolase assay using the SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain Mac1  We performed a pilot screen that identified dasatinib and dihydralazine as ADP-ribosylhydrolase inhibitors  Importantly  dasatinib inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Mac1 but not the closest human homologue  MacroD2  Our study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying selective inhibitors based on ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity  paving the way for the screening of large compound libraries to identify improved macrodomain inhibitors and to explore their potential as antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 and future viral threats,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904435
535,The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus  MERS-CoV  is the second of three zoonotic coronaviruses to infect humans since 2002  causing severe pneumonia  Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2  the causes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Covid-19  respectively  MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels  a domestic companion animal present across Africa  the Middle East and Central or South Asia and is sporadically transmitted to humans  However  it does not transmit readily from human to human except in hospital and household settings  Human MERS disease is reported only from the Arabian Peninsula  and only since 2012 even though the virus was detected in camels from at least the early 1990 s  and in travelers from this region  Remarkably  no zoonotic MERS disease has been detected in Africa or Asia  even in areas of high density of MERS-CoV infected dromedaries  Here  we review aspects of MERS biology and epidemiology that might contribute to this lack of correlation between sites of camel infection and human zoonotic disease  Since MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV have pandemic potential  further investigations into this disparity is critical  to forestall pandemics caused by this virus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999369
2263,This research has developed a method for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 N protein on a paper-based microfluidic chip  The chitosan-glutaraldehyde cross-linking method is used to fix the coated antibody  and the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent method is used to achieve the specific detection of the target antigen  The system studied the influence of coating antibody concentration and enzyme-labeled antibody concentration on target antigen detection  According to the average gray value measured under different N protein concentrations  the standard curve of the method was established and the sensitivity was tested  and its linear regression was obtained  The equation is y   9 8286x 137 6  R2   0 9772 > 0 90  which shows a high degree of fit  When the concentration of coating antibody and enzyme-labeled antibody were 1 mug mL and 2 mug mL  P > 0 05  the difference was not statistically significant  so the lower concentration of 1 mug mL was chosen as the coating antibody concentration  The results show that the minimum concentration of N protein that can be detected by this method is 8 mug mL  and the minimum concentration of coating antibody and enzyme-labeled antibody is 1 mug mL  which has the characteristics of high sensitivity and good repeatability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968171

7692,Introduction  Social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a risk factor of several mental disorders  Therefore  the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of social isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of a Mexican population  Materials and Methods  A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in individuals of 18 years of age and over  The questioner was structured to identify onset or worsening of psychiatric symptoms due to social isolation by COVID-19  The survey included changes in eating habits  changes in personal hygiene habits  the starting the use or increased the use of psychoactive substances  symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress  Results  A total of 1 011 individuals were included in the analysis  The majority were women  68 84    Changes in eating habits were reported in 38 51  of the participants  67 80  reported having their physical self-perception distorted or having started a low-calorie diet  Regarding symptoms of depression  46 10  participants indicated to have at least one depressive symptom  and 4 46  reported suicidal ideation during social isolation  Interestingly  6 09  of individuals reported that they used to have depressive symptoms prior the COVID-19 pandemic and those symptoms decreased due to social isolation  Additionally  2 27  of individuals presented symptoms of post-traumatic stress due to the possibility of getting COVID-19  Conclusions  In this work we identified how social isolation has impacted the mental health of the Mexican population  We observed that practically all the symptoms evaluated were affected during isolation  such as personal hygiene and eating habits  Depression and suicidal ideation were the ones that increased the most in the general population  while in individuals who had symptoms of depression before isolation  these symptoms decreased during social isolation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888275
172,Background  Prior observational studies indicated that lower educational attainment  EA  is associated with higher COVID-19 risk  while these findings were vulnerable to bias from confounding factors  We aimed to clarify the causal effect of EA on COVID-19 susceptibility  hospitalization  and severity using Mendelian randomization  MR   Methods  We identified genetic instruments for EA from a large genome-wide association study  GWAS   n   1 131 881   Summary statistics for COVID-19 susceptibility  112 612 cases and 2 474 079 controls   hospitalization  24 274 cases and 2 061 529 controls   and severity  8 779 cases and 1 001 875 controls  were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative  We used the single-variable MR  SVMR  and the multivariable MR  MVMR  controlling intelligence  income  body mass index  vigorous physical activity  sedentary behavior  smoking  and alcohol consumption to estimate the total and direct effects of EA on COVID-19 outcomes  Inverse variance weighted was the primary analysis method  All the statistical analyses were performed using R software  Results  Results from the SVMR showed that genetically predicted higher EA was correlated with a lower risk of COVID-19 susceptibility  odds ratio  OR  0 86  95  CI 0 84-0 89   hospitalization  OR 0 67  95  CI 0 62-0 73   and severity  OR 0 67  95  CI 0 58-0 79   EA still maintained its effects in most of the MVMR  Conclusion  Educational attainment is a predictor for susceptibility  hospitalization  and severity of COVID-19 disease  Population with lower EA should be provided with a higher prioritization to public health resources to decrease the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004565
5761,BACKGROUND  Orthopaedic surgery is one of the most competitive specialties for residency applicants  For the 2021 residency match  the coronavirus-19 pandemic introduced complexity for programs and applicants because away rotations were limited and in-person interviews were cancelled  This may have changed the landscape in terms of expenses for candidates in important ways  but this topic has been insufficiently studied  QUESTIONS PURPOSES  Given that in 2021  students did not attend away rotations and all interviews were held virtually  we asked  1  What were the financial savings associated with this change   2  Was medical school geographic region associated with differences in expenses when applying to residency  METHODS  A retrospective  cross-sectional analysis of the 2020 and 2021 Texas Seeking Transparency in Application to Residency Dashboard database was performed  The data were derived from an online survey of a nationwide pool of applicants from 87   123 of 141  of US allopathic medical schools upon conclusion of the match  The response percentage was 29   521 of 1794   We believe this nationwide dataset represents the largest and most current data for this applicant group  Responses from applicants applying to orthopaedic surgery residency in the year before the COVID-19 pandemic application changes  2020  and during COVID-19  2021  were queried and compared  After the orthopaedic surgery match  the database was evaluated for individual  application costs  away rotation expenses  and interview expenses  and total expenses for medical school seniors applying to orthopaedic surgery residency  Applicant characteristics were compared between application cycles  The 2020 to 2021 Texas Seeking Transparency in Application to Residency Dashboard database had 521 responses  n   263 in 2020 and n   258 in 2021  from applicants applying to orthopaedic surgery residency  Demographic and applicant characteristics were comparable between application cycles  Median expenses are reported with percentile distributions and geographic comparisons  A Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to determine whether there were statistically significant differences in expenses between years and between medical school regions at a p value threshold of < 0 05  RESULTS  For all applicants  the median total expenses  USD 7250 versus USD 2250   application costs  USD 2250 versus USD 1750   away rotation expenses  USD 2750 versus USD 250   and interview expenses  USD 2250 versus USD 75  declined in 2021 compared with 2020  all p < 0 001   The median total savings in expenses for all applicants in 2021 compared with 2020 was USD 5000  In 2021  median total expenses were lower in all geographic regions with the greatest savings from applicants in the West  USD 6000   in addition  the difference in median total expenses between the geographic region with the highest total expenses and the lowest total expenses was lower in the pandemic year than it was in the year prior  USD 1000 versus USD 1500  p < 0 001   In 2021  there were differences in total expenses between the Northeast  USD 1750   West  USD 1750   and Central  USD 2750  regions  p < 0 001   From 2020 to 2021  only application fees from Northeast applicants differed  USD 2250 versus USD 1250  p < 0 001   In 2020  interview expenses were not different between all regions  USD 2250 Northeast and West versus USD 2750 Central and South  p   0 19   similarly in 2021  interview expenses were similar between all regions  USD 75 versus USD 75  p   0 82   Finally  in 2020  Northeast  USD 3250  and Western  USD 3250  applicants spent more for away rotations than Southern  USD 2750  and Central  USD 2250  applicants  p   0 01   In 2021  applicants from schools in the South  USD 250  and Central  USD 250  regions spent more than their counterparts  USD 0  p   0 028   CONCLUSION  In the COVID-19 application cycle  the median expenditures of orthopaedic residency candidates were USD 5000 lower than they were in the previous year  the difference can be attributed to the use of virtual interviews and the lack of away rotations  There are geographic implications  with applicants from Western United States medical schools potentially saving the most  Despite the financial savings during the 2021 match  further study related to the long-term success of the current application process  both for applicants and programs  is needed  The recommendation in May 2020 by the AOA Council of Orthopaedic Residency Directors  CORD  to limit the number of applications submitted by candidates with USMLE Step 1 scores greater than 235 did not result in any considerable decline in applications submitted or expenses  A better understanding of how differences in these expenses may influence our specialty s ability to attract socioeconomically diverse candidates would be important  and we need to explore perceived and actual financial obstacles to obtaining this diversity in the application process  Finally  avenues should be explored by program directors and chairpersons to reduce the expenses of the traditional application process while maintaining recruitment of top candidates  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE  Level IV  economic analysis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913886

5861,Introduction  The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic on March 11  2020  Two vaccine types were developed using two different technologies  viral vectors and mRNA  Thrombosis is one of the most severe and atypical adverse effects of vaccines  This study aimed to analyze published cases of thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccinations to identify patients  features  potential pathophysiological mechanisms  timing of appearance of the adverse events  and other critical issues  Materials and Methods  We performed a systematic electronic search of scientific articles regarding COVID-19 vaccine-related thrombosis and its complications on the PubMed  MEDLINE  database and through manual searches  We selected 10 out of 50 articles from February 1 to May 5  2021 and performed a descriptive analysis of the adverse events caused by the mRNA-based Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and the adenovirus-based AstraZeneca vaccine  Results  In the articles on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines  the sample consisted of three male patients with age heterogeneity  The time from vaccination to admission was <  3 days in all cases  all patients presented signs of petechiae purpura at admission  with a low platelet count  In the studies on the AstraZeneca vaccine  the sample consisted of 58 individuals with a high age heterogeneity and a high female prevalence  Symptoms appeared around the ninth day  and headache was the most common symptom  The platelet count was below the lower limit of the normal range  All patients except one were positive for PF4 antibodies  The cerebral venous sinus was the most affected site  Death was the most prevalent outcome in all studies  except for one study in which most of the patients remained alive  Discussion  Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia  VITT  is an unknown nosological phenomenon secondary to inoculation with the COVID-19 vaccine  Several hypotheses have been formulated regarding its physiopathological mechanism  Recent studies have assumed a mechanism that is assimilable to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia  with protagonist antibodies against the PF4-polyanion complex  Viral DNA has a negative charge and can bind to PF4  causing VITT  New experimental studies have assumed that thrombosis is related to a soluble adenoviral protein spike variant  originating from splicing events  which cause important endothelial inflammatory events  and binding to endothelial cells expressing ACE2  Conclusion  Further studies are needed to better identify VITT s pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic  demographic  or clinical predisposition of high-risk patients  to investigate the correlation of VITT with the different vaccine types  and to test the significance of the findings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912330
3283,BACKGROUND  Virtual education has been described before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  Studies evaluating virtual OSCEs  vOSCE  with postgraduate learners is lacking  This study   1  evaluated the experiences of all participants in a vOSCE  and  2  assessed the validity and reliability of selected vOSCE stations for skills in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation  PMR   METHODS  Convergent mixed-methods design was used  Participants included three PMR residency programs holding a joint vOSCE  Analysis included descriptive statistics and thematic analysis  Performance of virtual to previous in-person OSCE was compared using independent t-tests  RESULTS  Survey response rate was 85   No participants had previous experience with vOSCE  Participants found the vOSCE to be acceptable  79 4    believable  84 4    and valuable for learning  93 9    No significant differences between in-person and vOSCE scores was found for 3 4 stations  and improved score in 1 4  Four themes were identified   1  vOSCEs are better for communication stations   2  significant organization is required to run a vOSCE   3  adaptations are required compared to in-person OSCEs  and  4  vOSCEs provide improved accessibility and useful practice for virtual clinical encounters  CONCLUSION  Utility of vOSCEs as a component of a program of assessment should be carefully considered and may provide valuable learning opportunities going forward,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954740
6244,Objective  We examine gender-based differences in perceived risks related to COVID-19  Methods  We analyze published findings from COVID-related research on beliefs and attitudes about the health risks posed by the pandemic  We also design and administer a pair of online survey experiments  n   502  to test if and how responsive men s attitudes are to information about male-specific risks  Results  Across 16 studies  men consistently express lower perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 and less concern about the potential health consequences if they were to catch it  Our experimental results are mixed  Results for one information treatment indicate that men report greater relative risk of adverse outcomes  Men in one of the risk information treatments express less concern for their health if they were to contract the disease  Risk perceptions are positively correlated with self-reported propensity toward protective behaviors  Conclusion  Our review of recent studies finds a small-but-consistent gap in men and women s beliefs about their health risks related to the present pandemic  These risk beliefs are crucial determinants of whether individuals take protective measures  Our experimental results suggest that informing men of male-specific risks associated with COVID-19 can reduce their risk perceptions and perceptions of risk and widen the gap between men and women s perceptions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908608
1655,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate excess mortality in Brazil from January 2020 to April 2021  according to the primary causes of death registered in the Brazilian Mortality Information System  MIS   METHODS  Cross-sectional study with data extracted from the MIS  Excess deaths were examined by the primary cause of death according to 11 grouped causes  Autoregressive models used mortality data from 2015 to 2019 to predict expected deaths from January 2020 to April 2021  Excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the observed and the expected number of deaths  RESULTS  Total excess deaths of 370 055 were observed in the studied period  corresponding to a ratio of observed to expected of 1 14 in 2020 and 1 40 in 2021  Excess deaths were seen in three groups  symptoms  signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings  not elsewhere classified  other diseases of the respiratory system and coronavirus infection  unspecified site  CONCLUSIONS  The excess mortality in Brazil in these 16 months was 1 20 times greater than the previous year  The increase in not elsewhere classified causes and causes of death associated to COVID-19 indicate caution about the negative balance for some causes  Furthermore  the inequalities of mortality reporting systems in low- and middle-income countries in relation to underestimation of mortality still need to be addressed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977938
3151,Introduction Hong Kong has had a low incidence of COVID-19 vaccine related anaphylaxis  partly due to its Vaccine Allergy Safety  VAS  guidelines for screening those at higher risk of COVID-19 vaccine-associated allergic reactions  We characterize the initial experience of the VAS clinics  as well as the impact of unnecessary referrals to the vaccination program  Methods All patients attending the VAS Clinics of the public and private health services between February and June  2021 were reviewed  Results Out of 1127 patients assessed at VAS clinics  1102  97 8   patients were recommended for vaccination  Out of those contacted  more than 80   450 558  received vaccination successfully  the remaining had not yet booked their vaccinations  The majority  87 5   of patients not recommended was due to potential excipient allergies  Males were significantly more likely to be recommended  OR  5 822  95  CI 1 361-24 903  p  0 007   but no other features were associated with recommendation for vaccination  Almost half  45 1   of public service referrals were rejected due to insufficient information or incorrect indications for referral  The majority of cases  56 2   of patients referred for suspected  anaphylaxis  did not fulfil diagnostic criteria  Discussion COVID-19 vaccination is very safe and 98  of high-risk patients were recommended for vaccination  Barriers to VAS include a high proportion of inappropriate referrals  inaccurate diagnoses of anaphylaxis and inability to diagnose excipient allergies  Our data validates that a prior history of COVID-vaccine unrelated anaphylaxis should be removed as a precaution for vaccination  Closer collaborations between primary care and allergy specialists and changes in pharmaceutical legislation should be made a priority to promote vaccination uptake,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956434
7727,Background  The development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 breakouts came with highly positive results but some unexpected side effects  Rare side effects have been seen with the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV 2 vaccine  Case Presentation  We present the case of a 45-year-old female patient who developed an acute kidney injury needing urgent hemodialysis one week after the second administration of the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV 2 vaccine  She developed a macular rash on her lower limbs and palms as well  A kidney biopsy was performed 10 days after vaccine inoculation  diagnosing acute interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis with cellular casts  The patient was treated with three corticosteroid pulses followed by daily prednisolone  We witnessed clinical improvement 4 days after the initial corticosteroid treatment with progressive recovery of kidney function and hemodialysis withdrawal  After 2 weeks  the patient had recovered her kidney function  Immunophenotyping was performed  diagnosing a hypersensitivity to the vaccine and the polyethylene glycol excipient  Conclusion  Patients may develop acute reactions to vaccines  In this case  symptoms seem to correlate significantly with its inoculation and  although this case had a favourable outcome  these side effects must be made aware for clinicians and patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887676
5859,Globally  vaccine hesitancy is a growing public health problem  It is detrimental to the consolidation of immunization program achievements and elimination of vaccine-targeted diseases  The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in China and explore its contributing factors  A national cross-sectional online survey among Chinese adults  >  18 years old  was conducted between August 6  2021 and August 9 via a market research company  We collected sociodemographic information  lifestyle behavior  quality of life  the knowledge  awareness  and behavior of COVID-19  the knowledge  awareness  and behavior of COVID-19 vaccine  willingness of COVID-19 vaccination  accessibility of COVID-19 vaccination services  skepticism about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine  doctor and vaccine developer scale  and so on  Odds ratios  OR  with 95  confidence intervals  CI  were used to estimate the associations by using logistic regression models  A total of 29 925 residents  48 64  men  were enrolled in our study with mean age of 30 99 years  We found an overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy at 8 40   95  CI  8 09-8 72  in primary vaccination and 8 39   95  CI  8 07-8 70  in booster vaccination  In addition  after adjusting for potential confounders  we found that women  higher educational level  married residents  higher score of health condition  never smoked  increased washing hands  increased wearing mask  increased social distance  lower level of vaccine conspiracy beliefs  disease risks outweigh vaccine risk  higher level of convenient vaccination  and higher level of trust in doctor and developer were more willing to vaccinate than all others  all p < 0 05   Age  sex  educational level  marital status  chronic disease condition  smoking  healthy behaviors  the curability of COVID-19  the channel of accessing information of COVID-19 vaccine  endorsement of vaccine conspiracy beliefs  weigh risks of vaccination against risks of the disease  making a positive influence on the health of others around you  and lower trust in healthcare system may affect the variation of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine  all p < 0 05   The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was modest in China  even with the slight resulting cascade of changing vaccination rates between the primary and booster vaccination  Urgent action to address vaccine hesitancy is needed in building trust in medical personnel and vaccine producers  promoting the convenience of vaccination services  and spreading reliable information of COVID-19 vaccination via the Internet and other media,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912346
8126,Background and objectives The novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has challenged healthcare systems worldwide  Various studies have revealed the negative impact of the pandemic on the education and mental health of medical students and residents  In this study  we aimed to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical interns  educational experience  clinical practice  and mental health  We also engage in a discussion on the compensatory methods that have been adopted to improve medical interns  learning processes during the ongoing pandemic  Methods This cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at the King Saud University Medical City  KSUMC  in Riyadh  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  KSA  from March to October 2020  The participants consisted of medical interns  The survey collected information on participants  demographics  training  and the educational and psychological impact of the pandemic  Results The survey was distributed to 480 medical interns  of whom 345  71 8   participated  Most of our sample  75 6   believed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their cumulative experience  Regarding the pandemic s impact on training and education  it was found that the emergency department rotation was the most affected rotation  60 3    The majority of the participants  55 9   believed that all tracks have received equal education and the volume of patients seen by interns decreased by 91 9   As for the compensatory methods  73 3  reported the utilization of remote platforms  Regarding the pandemic s mental health impact  36  believed that it has affected their mental health  where increased stress levels were noticed in 47 8  of participants  Statistical significance was found in both Patient Health Questionnaire-9  PHQ-9  and General Anxiety Disorder-7  GAD-7  scores  which indicated that during the pandemic  20 6  of the participants suffered from depression  and 13 9  had moderate to severe anxiety  Conclusions This study highlights the negative educational and psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical interns  With emerging infectious diseases on the rise  recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on medical interns is vital to improving interns  educational experiences and mental health during future crises,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881118
1952,The Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  outbreak caused a suspension of almost all non-essential human activities  leading to a significant reduction of anthropogenic emissions  However  the emission inventory of the chemistry transport model cannot be updated in time  resulting in large uncertainty in PM2 5 predictions  This study adopted a three-dimensional variational approach to assimilate multi-source PM2 5 data from satellite and ground observations and jointly adjusted emissions to improve PM2 5 predictions of the WRF-Chem model  Experiments were conducted to verify the method over Hubei Province  China  during the COVID-19 epidemic from Jan 21st to Mar 20th  2020  The results showed that PM2 5 predictions were improved at almost all the validation sites  and the benefit of data assimilation  DA  can last for 48 h  However  the benefits of DA diminished quickly with the increase of the forecast time  By adjusting emissions  the PM2 5 predictions showed a much slower error accumulation along forecast time  At 48Z  the RMSE still has an 8 85 mug m 3   19 49   improvement  suggesting the effectiveness of emissions adjustment based on the improved initial conditions via DA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974086
8961,Objectives  Endoscopy confers high risk for acquiring coronavirus disease 2019  Although guidelines recommend that medical staff use personal protective equipment  no infection control equipment have been established for patients  This study aimed to clarify the usefulness of two face masks we had designed for transnasal and transoral endoscopy  Methods  The efficacy of the masks was evaluated by simulating coughing in a mannequin with fluorescent dyes and mapping the droplet trajectory and number  The number of aerosols generated during endoscopy was clinically evaluated in the endoscopy room  Overall  4356 screening endoscopies were performed with the patients wearing our masks at Medcity21  a health checkup facility  between June and December 2020  the effects of the masks on the patient s condition were evaluated retrospectively  An 11-item paper-based survey was performed by the endoscopy staff 6 months after the adoption of the mask-based infection control method  Results  Use of both masks reduced the number of droplets released during the simulation  Clinically  the use of both masks did not affect the patients  conditions during endoscopy and prevented an increase in the aerosols in the endoscopy room  This mask-based infection control method was favorably received  and all staff indicated that understanding the efficacy of our mask-based infection control reduced their anxiety regarding infection  Until December 2020  none of our staff had contracted SARS-CoV-2  Conclusion  Our mask-based infection control method is easy to adopt  inexpensive  and effective  understanding its effectiveness may help ease the fear of infection among endoscopy staff,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868589
7545,BACKGROUND  There has been much debate about the effects and importance of closing  keeping closed  or not opening schools in order to prevent COVID-19 contagion  This policy has been questioned regarding both its efficacy and the social cost it entails  including the possible asymmetric impact it has on genders in many societies due to traditional childcare roles  To the best of our knowledge no existing contribution has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of such a policy over time  in a longitudinal cross-country perspective  OBJECTIVES  This paper aimed to fill the gap in the literature by assessing  at a European level  the effect of school closures  or the lack of such measures  on the numbers of new COVID-19 infections  in the absence of vaccines  Given this policy s expected change in effectiveness over time  we also measured the effectiveness of having schools closed after a given number of days  from 7 to 100   METHODS  We pursued our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis  building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries in Europe  from 1 January to 30 September  and estimating the impact of school closure via feasible-generalised least-squares fixed effect and random effect estimators  and analysis of variance  ANOVA  mixed models  RESULTS  Our results show that having schools closed is effective in reducing the number of new cases  Countries that implement closure have fewer new COVID-19 cases than those that do not  This becomes a reality around 20 days after the implementation of the policy  Its efficacy continues to be detectable up to 100 days after implementation  The result is robust to controls for other forms of social distancing  CONCLUSION  Results suggest that school closure is effective in reducing the number of people who are infected with COVID-19  Unlike what has been suggested in previous analyses or with regard to other diseases  its efficacy continues to be detectable up to 100 days after the introduction of the policy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890025
3815,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting the functioning of the entire healthcare system  The disease itself may be associated with thromboembolic complications  The purpose of this study is to compare patients with acute coronary syndrome  ACS  and patients with ACS who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in terms of their clinical profile  management  treatment complications  and prognosis  METHODS  We analyzed 47 940 cases of patients treated for ACS in 2020  including 44 952 patients  93 8   who were not diagnosed with COVID-19 and 2988 patients  6 2   who tested positive for COVID-19  RESULTS  Patients with COVID-19 were significantly more likely to experience out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest  7 9 vs  1 1   p < 0 0001  and be transported directly to a catheterization laboratory  21 3  vs  8 1   p < 0 0001   Mortality was significantly higher in this group  0 9  vs  0 4   p < 0 0001   The risk of perioperative death was increased by age over 65 years  use of glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitors  GPI IIb IIIa   femoral access  critical left main stem coronary artery  LMCA  vascular lesions  ST elevation myocardial infarction  STEMI   and no-reflow phenomenon  CONCLUSIONS  Despite the pandemic  patients with COVID-19 were treated equally to healthy patients  Efficient organization of the healthcare system allowed the prompt transportation of patients to catheterization laboratories  The study group was characterized by a worse prognosis that was affected by multiple factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34944629
5662,BACKGROUND  The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant  designated as a Variant of Concern VOC  by the World Health Organization  carries numerous spike mutations which have are known to evade neutralizing antibodies elicited by COVID-19 vaccines  A deeper understanding of the susceptibility of Omicron variant to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies is urgently needed for risk assessment  METHODS  Omicron variant strains HKU691 and HKU344-R346K were isolated from patients using TMPRSS2-overexpressing VeroE6 cells  Whole genome sequence was determined using nanopore sequencing  Neutralization susceptibility of ancestral lineage A virus and the Omicron  Delta and Beta variants to sera from 25 BNT162b2 and 25 Coronavac vaccine recipients was determined using a live virus microneutralization assay  RESULTS  The Omicron variant strain HKU344-R346K has an additional spike R346K mutation  which is present in 8 5  of strains deposited in GISAID database  Only 20  and 24  of BNT162b2 recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody against the Omicron variant HKU691 and HKU344-R346K  respectively  while none of the Coronavac recipients had detectable neutralizing antibody titer against either Omicron isolate  For BNT162b2 recipients  the geometric mean neutralization antibody titers GMT  of the Omicron variant isolates 5 43 and 6 42  were 35 7-39 9-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus 229 4   and the GMT of both Omicron variant isolates were significantly lower than those of the Beta and Delta variants  There was no significant difference in the GMT between HKU691 and HKU344-R346K  CONCLUSIONS  Omicron variant escapes neutralizing antibodies elicited by BNT162b2 or Coronavac  The additional R346K mutation did not affect the neutralization susceptibility  Our data suggest that the Omicron variant may be associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915551
168,Many regions observed recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19 cases after relaxing social distancing measures  It suggests that maintaining sufficient social distancing is important for limiting the spread of COVID-19  The change of population behavior responding to the social distancing measures becomes an important factor for the pandemic prediction  In this paper  we develop a SEAIR model for studying the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission with population behavioral change  In our model  the population is divided into several groups with their own social behavior in response to the delayed information about the number of the infected population  The transmission rate depends on the behavioral changes of all the population groups  forming a feedback loop to affect the COVID-19 dynamics  Based on the data of Hong Kong  our simulations demonstrate how the perceived cost after infection and the information delay affect the level and the time period of the COVID-19 waves,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004580
6835,The post-coronavirus disease  COVID-19  mucormycosis is a deadly addition to the pandemic spectrum  Although it s a rare  aggressive  and opportunistic disease  the associated morbidity and mortality are significant  The complex interplay of factors aggravating CAM is uncontrolled diabetes  irrational and excessive use of antibiotics  steroids  and an impaired immune system  Recently  India has been witnessing a rapid surge in the cases of coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis  CAM   since the second wave of COVID-19  The devastating and lethal implications of CAM had now become a matter of global attention  A delayed diagnosis is often associated with a poor prognosis  Therefore  the rapid and early diagnosis of infection would be life-saving  Prevention and effective management of mucormycosis depend upon its early and accurate diagnosis followed by a multimodal therapeutic approach  The current review summarizes an array of detection methods and highlights certain evolving technologies for early and rapid diagnosis of CAM  Furthermore  several potential management strategies have also been discussed  which would aid in tackling the neglected yet fatal crisis of mucormycosis associated with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900512
8334,Patients recovering from COVID-19 may have persistent debilitating symptoms requiring long term support through individually tailored cardiopulmonary and psychological rehabilitation programs  Clinicians need to be aware about the likely long-term complications and their diagnostic assessments to help identify any occult problems requiring additional help  Endocrinological evaluations should be considered as part of the armamentarium in the management of such individuals with diligent cognizance about the involvement of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal  HPA  axis  adrenal and thyroid function  We here review the literature and potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in and related to post COVID-19 symptoms with an emphasis on endocrine function,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877261

1259,Some of the patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinomas have a coexistent differentiated thyroid cancer  sustaining the hypothesis that this cancer may develop from more differentiated tumors  We describe a case with a collision tumor of the thyroid  defined as a neoplastic lesion composed of two distinct cell populations  with distinct borders  The patient presented during the COVID-19 pandemic with dysphonia  dyspnea  multinodular goiter and a painless  rapidly enlarging  left cervical swelling  She had been first time diagnosed with left nodular goiter in 2007  with an indication for surgery  which she declined  After partial excision of the left latero-cervical adenopathy  the pathological analysis showed massive lymph node metastasis from anaplastic thyroid cancer  A total thyroidectomy was done  the postoperative pathological exam identified a papillary thyroid microcarcinoma in the right lobe and an anaplastic thyroid cancer in the left lobe  Postoperatively  levothyroxine treatment was started and the patient was referred to radiotherapy  This case highlights the importance of urgent management of some cases with compressive multinodular goiter  even during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984229
3464,BACKGROUND  Reduced hospital admission rates for heart failure  HF  and evidence of increased in-hospital mortality were reported during the COVID-19 pandemic  The aim of this study was to apply a machine learning  ML -based mortality prediction model to examine whether the latter is attributable to differing case mixes and exceeds expected mortality rates  METHODS AND RESULTS  Inpatient cases with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF non-electively admitted to 86 German Helios hospitals between 01 01 2016 and 08 31 2020 were identified  Patients with proven or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded  ML-based models were developed  tuned  and tested using cases of 2016-2018  n   64 440  randomly split 75  25    Extreme gradient boosting showed the best model performance indicated by a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0 882  95  confidence interval  CI   0 872-0 893   The model was applied on data sets of 2019 and 2020  n   28 556 cases  and the hospital standardized mortality ratio  HSMR  was computed as the observed to expected death ratio  Observed mortality rates were 5 84   2019  and 6 21   2020   HSMRs based on an individual case-based mortality probability were 100 0  95  CI  93 3-107 2  p   1 000  for 2019 and 99 3  95  CI  92 5-106 4  p    850  for 2020  Within subgroups of age or hospital volume  there were no significant differences between observed and expected deaths  When stratified for pandemic phases  no excess death during the COVID-19 pandemic was observed  CONCLUSION  Applying an ML algorithm to calculate expected inpatient mortality based on administrative data  there was no excess death above expected event rates in HF patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951030
68,The recent outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  calls for rapid mobilization of scientists to probe and explore solutions to this deadly disease  A limited understanding of the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  relative to other coronavirus strains guides a deeper investigation into the virus receptor interactions  The cutting-edge studies in thermodynamic and kinetic properties of interactions such as protein-protein interplays have been reviewed in many modeling and analysis studies  Highlighting the thermodynamic assessments of biological interactions and emphasizing the boosted transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 despite its high similarity in structure and sequence with other coronavirus strains is an important and highly valuable investigation that can lead scientists to discover analytical and fundamental approaches in studying virus s interactions  Accordingly  we have attempted to describe the crucial factors such as conformational changes and hydrophobicity particularities that influence on thermodynamic potentials in the SARS-COV-2 S-protein adsorption process  Discussing the thermodynamic potentials and the kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in its interaction with the ACE2 receptors of the host cell is a fundamental approach that would be extremely valuable in designing candidate pharmaceutical agents or exploring alternative treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006423
248,Background  Limited data are available regarding the balance of risks and benefits from human milk and or breastfeeding during and following maternal infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Objective  To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in milk and on the breast after maternal coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  diagnosis  and characterize concentrations of milk immunoglobulin  Ig  A specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain  RBD  during the 2 months after onset of symptoms or positive diagnostic test  Methods  Using a longitudinal study design  we collected milk and breast skin swabs one to seven times from 64 lactating women with COVID-19 over a 2-month period  beginning as early as the week of diagnosis  Milk and breast swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  and milk was tested for anti-RBD IgA  Results  SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any milk sample or on 71  of breast swabs  Twenty-seven out of 29  93   breast swabs collected after breast washing tested negative for SARS-CoV-2  Detection of SARS-CoV-2 on the breast was associated with maternal coughing and other household COVID-19  Most  75   95  CI  70-79   n 316  milk samples contained anti-RBD IgA  and concentrations increased  P  02  during the first two weeks following onset of COVID-19 symptoms or positive test  Milk-borne anti-RBD IgA persisted for at least two months in 77  of women  Conclusion  Milk produced by women with COVID-19 does not contain SARS-CoV-2 and is likely a lasting source of passive immunity via anti-RBD IgA  These results support recommendations encouraging lactating women to continue breastfeeding during and after COVID-19 illness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003130
6151,The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of interaction between quercetin-3-O-sophoroside and different SARS-CoV-2 s proteins which can bring some useful details about the control of different variants of coronavirus including the recent case  Delta  The chemical structure of the quercetin-3-O-sophoroside was first optimized  Docking studies were performed by CoV disease-2019  COVID-19  Docking Server  Afterwards  the molecular dynamic study was done using High Throughput Molecular Dynamics  HTMD  tool  The results showed a remarkable stability of the quercetin-3-O-sophoroside based on the calculated parameters  Docking outcomes revealed that the highest affinity of quercetin-3-O-sophoroside was related to the RdRp with RNA  Molecular dynamic studies showed that the target E protein tends to be destabilized in the presence of quercetin-3-O-sophoroside  Based on these results  quercetin-3-O-sophoroside can show promising inhibitory effects on the binding site of the different receptors and may be considered as effective inhibitor of the entry and proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 and its different variants  Finally  it should be noted  although this paper does not directly deal with the exploring the interaction of main proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant with quercetin-3-O-sophoroside  at the time of writing  no direct theoretical investigation was reported on the interaction of ligands with the main proteins of Delta variant  Therefore  the present data may provide useful information for designing some theoretical studies in the future for studying the control of SARS-CoV-2 variants due to possible structural similarity between proteins of different variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909059

2564,This article presents a preliminary analysis of the advice provided by the UK government s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies  SAGE  held between 22 January and 23 March 2020 in response to the emerging coronavirus pandemic  Drawing on the published minutes of the group s meetings  the article examines what was known and not known  the assumptions and working practices that shaped their work  and how this knowledge was reflected in the decisions made by the government  In doing so  the article critically examines what it means for policy making to be  led by the science  when the best available science is provisional and uncertain  Using ideas of  externality  and  evidential significance   the article argues that the apparent desire for high levels of certainty by both scientists and political decision-makers made early action impossible as the data needed were not  and could not be  available in time  This leads to an argument for changes to the institutions that provide scientific advice based on sociologically informed expectations of science in which expert judgement plays a more significant role,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963397

4896,The COVID-19 pandemic led to the reorganization of health care in several countries  including Brazil  Inborn Errors of Metabolism  IEM  are a group of rare and difficult to diagnose genetic diseases caused by pathogenic variants in genes that code for enzymes  cofactors  or structural proteins affecting different metabolic pathways  The aim of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 affected the diagnosis of patients with IEM during the first year of the pandemic in Brazil comparing two distinct periods  from March 1st  2019 to February 29th  2020  TIME A  and from March 1st  2020 to February 28th  2021  TIME B   by the analysis of the number of tests and diagnoses performed in a Reference Center in South of Brazil  In the comparison TIME A with TIME B  we observe a reduction in the total number of tests performed  46   and in the number of diagnoses  34    In both periods analyzed  mucopolysaccharidoses  all subtypes combined  was the most frequent LD suspected and or confirmed  Our data indicates a large reduction in the number of tests requested for the investigation of IEM and consequently a large reduction in the number of diagnoses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a significant underdiagnosis of IEM,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927665
9632,OBJECTIVES  COVID-19 has altered health sector capacity in low-income and middle-income countries  LMICs   Cost data to inform evidence-based priority setting are urgently needed  Consequently  in this paper  we calculate the full economic health sector costs of COVID-19 clinical management in 79 LMICs under different epidemiological scenarios  METHODS  We used country-specific epidemiological projections from a dynamic transmission model to determine number of cases  hospitalisations and deaths over 1 year under four mitigation scenarios  We defined the health sector response for three base LMICs through guidelines and expert opinion  We calculated costs through local resource use and price data and extrapolated costs across 79 LMICs  Lastly  we compared cost estimates against gross domestic product  GDP  and total annual health expenditure in 76 LMICs  RESULTS  COVID-19 clinical management costs vary greatly by country  ranging between <0 1 -12  of GDP and 0 4 -223  of total annual health expenditure  excluding out-of-pocket payments   Without mitigation policies  COVID-19 clinical management costs per capita range from US 43 39 to US 75 57  in 22 of 76 LMICs  these costs would surpass total annual health expenditure  In a scenario of stringent social distancing  costs per capita fall to US 1 10-US 1 32  CONCLUSIONS  We present the first dataset of COVID-19 clinical management costs across LMICs  These costs can be used to inform decision-making on priority setting  Our results show that COVID-19 clinical management costs in LMICs are substantial  even in scenarios of moderate social distancing  Low-income countries are particularly vulnerable and some will struggle to cope with almost any epidemiological scenario  The choices facing LMICs are likely to remain stark and emergency financial support will be needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857521
7613,Background Currently  there is limited research on the prognostic value of NT-proBNP  N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide  as a biomarker in COVID-19  We proposed the a priori hypothesis that an elevated NT-proBNP concentration at admission is associated with increased in-hospital mortality  Methods and Results In this prospective  observational cohort study of the American Heart Association s COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry  4675 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were divided into normal and elevated NT-proBNP cohorts by standard age-adjusted heart failure thresholds  as well as separated by quintiles  Patients with elevated NT-proBNP  n 1344  28 7   were older  with more cardiovascular risk factors  and had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital mortality  37  versus 16   P<0 001  and shorter median time to death  7 versus 9 days  P<0 001  than those with normal values  Analysis by quintile of NT-proBNP revealed a steep graded relationship with mortality  7 1 -40 2   P<0 001   NT-proBNP was also associated with major adverse cardiac events  intensive care unit admission  intubation  shock  and cardiac arrest  P<0 001 for each   In subgroup analyses  NT-proBNP  but not prior heart failure  was associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality  Adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors with presenting vital signs  an elevated NT-proBNP was associated with 2-fold higher adjusted odds of death  adjusted odds ratio  OR   2 23  95  CI  1 80-2 76   and the log-transformed NT-proBNP with other biomarkers projected a 21  increased risk of death for each 2-fold increase  adjusted OR  1 21  95  CI  1 08-1 34   Conclusions Elevated NT-proBNP levels on admission for COVID-19 are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and other complications in patients with and without heart failure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889112

3245,We investigated similar compounds to ebselen and tideglusib  which exhibit strong activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   using MACCS keys  Four candidate compounds were identified  One of them  phenyl-benzothiazol-3-one  showed coronavirus-specific 3C-like  3CL  protease inhibitory activity  The results indicated that a similarity score above 0 81 is a good indicator of activity for ebselen-and-tideglusib-like compounds  Subsequently  we simulated the ring-cleavage Michael reaction of ebselen at the Se center  which is responsible for its 3CL protease inhibitory activity  and determined the activation free energy of the reaction  The results showed that reaction simulation is a useful tool for estimating the activity of inhibitory compounds that undergo Michael addition reactions with the relevant cysteine S atom of 3CL proteases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955489
7051,Currently  many deep learning models are being used to classify COVID-19 and normal cases from chest X-rays  However  the available data  X-rays  for COVID-19 is limited to train a robust deep-learning model  Researchers have used data augmentation techniques to tackle this issue by increasing the numbers of samples through flipping  translation  and rotation  However  by adopting this strategy  the model compromises for the learning of high-dimensional features for a given problem  Hence  there are high chances of overfitting  In this paper  we used deep-convolutional generative adversarial networks algorithm to address this issue  which generates synthetic images for all the classes  Normal  Pneumonia  and COVID-19   To validate whether the generated images are accurate  we used the k-mean clustering technique with three clusters  Normal  Pneumonia  and COVID-19   We only selected the X-ray images classified in the correct clusters for training  In this way  we formed a synthetic dataset with three classes  The generated dataset was then fed to The EfficientNetB4 for training  The experiments achieved promising results of 95  in terms of area under the curve  AUC   To validate that our network has learned discriminated features associated with lung in the X-rays  we used the Grad-CAM technique to visualize the underlying pattern  which leads the network to its final decision,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898799
6248,Using weekly variation from April 23 to June 23 2020  we exploit the surge in unemployment over the coronavirus pandemic to identify the effects on mental health outcomes and the role of marital status as a protective factor for households  We find that married respondents are 1-2 percentage points less likely  relative to their unmarried counterparts  to experience mental health problems following declines in work-related income since the start of the pandemic  Our results suggest that the combination of intrafamily substitution and the psychological benefits of marriage helps insure against unanticipated fluctuations in job and income loss,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908604
185,Novel coronavirus pneumonia has had a significant impact on people s lives and psychological health  We developed a stage model to analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of public panic during the two waves of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  We used tweets with geographic location data from the popular hashtag  Lockdown Diary  recorded from 23 January to April 8  2020  and  Nanjing Outbreak  recorded from 21 July to 1 September 2021 on Weibo  Combining the lexicon-based sentiment analysis and the grounded theory approach  this panic model could explain people s panic and behavioural responses in different areas at different stages of the pandemic  Next  we used the latent Dirichlet allocation topic model to reconfirm the panic model  The results showed that public sentiments fluctuated strongly in the early stages  in this case  panic and prayers were the dominant sentiments  In terms of spatial distribution  public panic showed hierarchical and neighbourhood diffusion  with highly assertive expressions of sentiment at the outbreak sites  economically developed areas  and areas surrounding the outbreak  Most importantly  we considered that public panic was affected by the 17 specific topics extracted based on the perceived and actual distance of the pandemic  thus stimulating the process of panic from minimal  acute  and mild panic to perceived rationality  Consequently  the public s behavioural responses shifted from delayed  negative  and positive  to rational behavioural responses  This study presents a novel approach to explore public panic from both a time and space perspective and provides some suggestions in response to future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004139
9696,The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a medical and epidemiological problem  In fact  its impact concerns numerous aspects of human life  such as social and the political-economic dimension   This review aims at highlighting some crucial and neglected aspects of the pandemic in order to include them into a more general framework for the understanding of the phenomenon  Accordingly  it is structured as follows  First  after e brief recap of COVID-19 onset  it is argued the so-called proximate causes of the pandemic  i e   the mechanisms by which viruses infect their hosts and the patterns of spread of the resulting pathologies  are not enough for a more adequate understanding of it  Second  it is shown how possible solutions to the risk of an upcoming pandemic involve studying the ultimate causes of this phenomenon  This means understanding not only how COVID-19 has become a global issue but also why it was possible for this to happen  Next  it is argued that is urgent to go to the root of the possible conditions  thus looking at the ecological dimension of diseases  the role of microorganisms in evolution  up to rethinking the organization of health systems  Third  to keep these very different perspectives together entails the study of COVID-19 from the point of view of the relationships between biological entities in a purely systemic dimension  Fourth  special attention is given to the symbiotic perspective offered by the study of the microbiota  It is argued how this perspective on microbiota provides an innovative interpretative lens with which to analyze various aspects  from the immunological to the ecosystemic one  of the pandemic  In conclusion  it is claimed that this field of study could perhaps offer not only elements that will be useful to make the treatment and containment strategies of the pandemic effective in its mechanisms  but also may suggest innovative elements for the solutions about the deep reasons that have made COVID-19 a global issue,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856767
6794,Background  The spread of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  throughout the world leads to a series of modifications of several National Health Service organizations  with a potential series of psychological consequences among nurses  Methods  This study was undertaken to assess the psychological stress  anxiety factors  and coping mechanisms of critical care unit nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak  A cross-sectional research design was employed  and the convenience sample consisted of 469 nurses working at several hospitals in Saudi Arabia during the period from July to September 2020  This study used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder  Coping Mechanism  and Nursing Stress scale  Results  Interestingly  more than one-third and one-quarter of the studied nurses had severe and moderate anxiety levels  respectively  In addition  the most anxiety-causing factors included providing care for their infected colleagues and worrying about infecting their families  More than one-quarter and slightly less than half of the studied nurses had high and moderate stress levels  respectively  Furthermore  more than half of the participants had low coping mechanisms and one-quarter had moderate coping mechanisms  In addition  there was a strong positive correlation between anxiety and stress levels  and there was a strong negative correlation between coping mechanisms and stress and anxiety levels  Conclusions  Collectively  this study explored the psychological stress  anxiety factors  and coping mechanisms among critical care unit nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia  Continuous educational programs for nurses on using coping mechanisms should be developed in combination with teaching preventive measures for defining a psychological intervention plan within a mandatory occupational health surveillance program  This study recommends that constructive planning and necessary provision of supportive measures by the legal authorities and policymakers protect nurses and minimize their psychological stress to fulfill high-quality nursing care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900913
3184,Background  Understanding the direction and magnitude of mental health-loneliness associations across time is important to understand how best to prevent and treat mental health and loneliness  This study used weekly data collected over 8 weeks throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to expand previous findings and using dynamic panel models with fixed effects which account for all time-invariant confounding and reverse causation  Methods  Prospective data on a convenience and snowball sample from all 50 US states and the District of Colombia  n   2 361 with >  2 responses  63 8  female  76  retention rate  were collected weekly via online survey at nine consecutive timepoints  April 3-June 3  2020   Anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness were assessed at each timepoint and participants reported the COVID-19 containment strategies they were following  Dynamic panel models with fixed effects examined bidirectional associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness  and associations of COVID-19 containment strategies with these outcomes  Results  Depressive symptoms were associated with small increases in both anxiety symptoms  beta   0 065  95  CI   0 022-0 109  p   0 004  and loneliness  beta   0 019  0 008-0 030  p   0 001  at the subsequent timepoint  Anxiety symptoms were associated with a small subsequent increase in loneliness  beta   0 014  0 003-0 025  p   0 015  but not depressive symptoms  beta   0 025  -0 020-0 070  p   0 281   Loneliness was strongly associated with subsequent increases in both depressive  beta   0 309  0 159-0 459  p < 0 001  and anxiety  beta   0 301  0 165-0 436  p < 0 001  symptoms  Compared to social distancing  adhering to stay-at-home orders or quarantining were not associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms or loneliness  both p >   0 095   Conclusions  High loneliness may be a key risk factor for the development of future anxiety or depressive symptoms  underscoring the need to combat or prevent loneliness both throughout and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic  COVID-19 containment strategies were not associated with mental health  indicating that other factors may explain previous reports of mental health deterioration throughout the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955910
1410,Background Introduction  The shelter-in-place orders and social distancing regulations on account of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted lifestyles  including the use of cannabis  The purpose of this scoping review is to summarize both the gray and academic literature on the use of cannabis during the pandemic  Materials and Methods  A total of 11 databases  including 2 medical databases  7 social science databases  and 2 gray literature databases were searched resulting in 316 titles and abstracts of which 76 met inclusion criteria  Results  Nine themes emerged   a  prevalence and trends of cannabis use during COVID 1 19   b  demographics   c  profile of mode of consumption   d  context of using cannabis  i e   solitary use vs  in groups    e  factors contributing to use   f  factors inhibiting use   g  adverse clinical and psychiatric outcomes of cannabis use during the pandemic   h  similarities between EVALI  E-Cigarette or Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury  and COVID-19 symptoms   i  implications for policy and practice  Studies published until February 2  2021 were included in this review  Discussion  Findings have highlighted that feelings of boredom  depression  and anxiety during the pandemic have contributed to an increase in the use of cannabis  Furthermore  accessibility to cannabis was noted to affect use during the pandemic  Adverse psychiatric and clinical outcomes were associated with the increased use of cannabis  Conclusion  Practitioners and policymakers are called to employ harm reduction strategies to respond to increasing cannabis use  There is a need for population-based studies and further examination of factors contributing to the increased use of cannabis during the pandemic and associated negative consequences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981958

1840,As the COVID-19 pandemic was unfolding  a surge in scams was registered across the globe  While COVID-19 poses higher health risks for older adults  it is unknown whether older adults are also facing higher financial risks as a result of COVID-19 scams  Here  we examined age differences in vulnerability to COVID-19 scams and individual difference measures  such as impulsivity  ad skepticism  and past experiences with fraud  that might help explain them  A lifespan sample  M   48 03  SD   18 56  of sixty-eight younger  18-40 years  M   25 67  SD   5 93   79 middle-aged  41-64 years  M   49 86  SD   7 20   and 63 older adults  65-84 years  M   69 87  SD   4 50  recruited through Prolific completed questions and questionnaires online  In a within-subjects design  each participant responded to five COVID-19 solicitations  psychological measures  and demographic questions  Age group comparisons revealed that older adults were marginally less likely to perceive COVID-19 solicitations as genuine than middle-aged adults were  In addition  older adults perceived significantly fewer benefits than both younger and middle-aged adults did and perceived marginally higher risks than younger adults did  Hence  older adults did not exhibit greater vulnerability to COVID-19 scams  Regardless of age  intentions to respond to COVID-19 solicitations were positively predicted by higher levels of educational attainment  being married  past fraud victimization  and higher levels of positive urgency  As expected  stronger genuineness and benefit perceptions positively predicted action intentions  whereas stronger risk perceptions negatively predicted action intentions As such  COVID-19 scam susceptibility appears to be the result of a impulse control issue that is not easily inhibited  not even by past experiences of scam victimization,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975685
99,PURPOSE  The purpose of this quality improvement project was to examine the feasibility of rapidly converting a Tai Chi program for older Veterans from face-to-face to virtual classes  METHODS  Eighteen Veterans attending our face-to-face Tai Chi course were invited to transition to virtual classes  Feasibility was defined as the ability of program staff and participants to successfully connect and complete the initial and subsequent classes by VA Video Connect  VVC  with little to no technical difficulties  participant ability to participate in the course without safety concerns  and favorable feedback from participants and program staff  RESULTS  Nine of 18 Veterans agreed to transition to the virtual program and attended a median  interquartile range  of 11  4-15  classes  they were younger  62 7   11 5 vs  70 5   7 0 years  p <  05  and more likely to have the knowledge and equipment needed to participate  78  vs  0   p <  01  than nonparticipants  Tai Chi instructors and participating Veterans reported being able to connect to and complete the classes virtually with only minimal technical problems  No adverse events were reported  Feedback from the instructors and Veterans was positive and included comments on ease of use and enjoyability  CONCLUSION  Results suggest that virtual Tai Chi classes via VVC are feasible for some older Veterans,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005787
1355,Quantitation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  in human serum could ensure that patients have adequate levels of mAbs for effective treatment  This research describes the use of affinity  glass-fiber membranes in a 96-well-plate format for rapid  <5 min  quantitation of the therapeutic mAb trastuzumab and a mAb against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  Adsorption of a poly acrylic acid -containing film in membrane pores and activation of the -COOH groups in the film enable covalent-linking of affinity peptides or proteins to the membrane  Passage of mAb-containing serum through the affinity membrane results in mAb capture within 1 min  Subsequent rinsing  binding of a secondary antibody conjugated to a fluorophore  and a second rinse yield mAb-concentration-dependent fluorescence intensities in the wells  Calibration curves established from analyses on different days have low variability and allow determination of mAb levels in separately prepared samples with an average error <10   although errors in single-replicate measurements may reach 40   The assays can occur in diluted serum with physiologically relevant mAb concentrations  as well as in undiluted serum  Thus  the combination of 96-well plates containing affinity membranes  a microplate reader  and a simple vacuum manifold affords convenient mAb quantitation in <5 min,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982935
3235,The development of preventive vaccines became the first order task in the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2  This paper reports the construction of the pVAX-RBD plasmid containing the Receptor-Binding Domain  RBD  of the S protein and a unique signal sequence 176 which promotes target protein secretion into the extracellular space thereby increasing the efficiency of humoral immune response activation  A polyglucine-spermidine conjugate  PGS  was used to deliver pVAX-RBD into the cells  The comparative immunogenicity study of the naked pVAX-RBD and pVAX-RBD enclosed in the PGS envelope showed that the latter was more efficient in inducing an immune response in the immunized mice  In particular  RBD-specific antibody titers were shown in ELISA to be no higher than 1   1000 in the animals from the pVAX-RBD group and 1   42 000  in the pVAX-RBD-PGS group  The pVAX-RBDPGS construct effectively induced cellular immune response  Using ELISpot  it has been demonstrated that splenocytes obtained from the immunized animals effectively produced INF-gamma in response to stimulation with the S protein-derived peptide pool  The results suggest that the polyglucine-spermidine conjugate-enveloped pVAX-RBD construct may be considered as a promising DNA vaccine against COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955558
567,OBJECTIVE  The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted mental health  increasing rates of substance misuse  Resilience is a positive adaptation to stress that may act as a buffer against adverse mental health outcomes  Based on prior knowledge  we hypothesized that PLWH would display higher resilience than HIV-uninfected peers  and that high resilience would be associated with lower risk of substance misuse  METHODS  This analysis of the Collaborating Consortium of Cohorts Producing NIDA Opportunities  C3PNO  included data from six USA cohorts that administered a COVID-19-related survey with a 3-month follow-up during May 2020 and March 2021  All data was self-reported  The Brief Resilience Scale and General Anxiety Disorder-7 were utilized  Primary analyses consisted of multivariate generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts using binary logistic regression  RESULTS  A total of 1430 participants completed both surveys  of whom 670  46 9   were PLWH  PLWH had lower odds of anxiety  OR 0 67  95  CI  0 51-0 89  and higher odds of high resilience  OR 1 21  95  CI  1 02-1 44  than HIV-uninfected participants  adjusted for covariates  The presence of anxiety was associated with higher risk of misuse of all substances  High resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and misuse of substances  adjusted for covariates  CONCLUSIONS  Psychological resilience was associated with lower risk of anxiety and substance misuse  potentially serving as a buffer against poor mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic  Further research is needed to identify pathways of resilience in the context of substance misuse and comprehensive resilience-focused interventions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34998257

1430,BACKGROUND  Despite the extraordinary speed of mass vaccination efforts  an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  delta variant in a vaccinee with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  mRNA vaccine was identified in an adult day service center  ADSC  of Jeju  South Korea  The primary objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiologic features in infection-vulnerable facilities with a high vaccination rate of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  The second was to estimate the secondary transmission prevention effect of the vaccine in the household members by vaccination status  METHODS  We included all ADSC participants  staff and their household members  All COVID-19 infected cases were confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  We calculated attack rate in ADSC and the secondary attack rate  SAR  in household members by vaccination status  RESULTS  Among a total of 42 participants and 16 staff  of which 96 6  were fully vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  12 symptomatic cases and 13 asymptomatic confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found  The attack rate was 43 1   with 13 isolates identified as SARS-CoV-2 virus  delta variant  The SAR in unvaccinated and partially vaccinated household members were 27 8   5 18  and 25 0   5 20   respectively  while the SAR in fully vaccinated household members was 12 5   1 8   CONCLUSION  We describe a SARS-CoV-2 delta variant outbreak in ADSC with high vaccine coverage rate  characterized by high infection rate  high transmissibility  and low clinical severity  The outbreak proceeded to unvaccinated or partially vaccinated household members  emphasizing the need for immunizing close contacts of high-risk groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981682
9177,The COVID-19 pandemic and especially the lockdowns coming with it have been a disruptive event also for food consumption  In order to study the impact of the pandemic on eating habits  self-reported changes in food-related behaviours were investigated in ten European countries by means of an online survey  A latent class cluster analysis distinguished five clusters and showed that different types of consumers can be distinguished based on how they react to the pandemic as regards their eating habits  While food-related behaviours were resilient for 60  of the sample  another 35  reported more enjoyment in cooking and eating  more time in the kitchen and more family meals  Among those  a slight majority also showed signs of more mindful eating  as indicated by more deliberate choices and increased consumption of healthy food  whereas a slight minority reported more consumption of indulgence food  Only 5  indicated less involvement with food  As the COVID-19 pandemic is a disruptive event  some of these changes may have habit-breaking properties and open up new opportunities and challenges for food policy and food industry,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865770
4341,OBJECTIVES  The present study examined the impact of psychological stress related to COVID-19 on anxiety as well as protective factors against these negative psychological consequences among middle-aged and older adults in the largest outbreak areas in South Korea  METHOD  Participants included 667 middle-aged and older adults  ages 40 to 76  living in the largest outbreak areas at the time of the survey based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea  Path analysis was conducted  RESULTS  Stress related to COVID-19 and loneliness were positively associated with anxiety  However  family cohesion  resilience  health  and being married were negatively associated with anxiety  Also  family cohesion  resilience  income  and being married were negatively associated with loneliness among middle-aged and older adults in the largest outbreak areas in South Korea  CONCLUSION  As postulated by the Stress Process Model  stress related to COVID-19 may have increased loneliness and anxiety among middle-aged and older adults in the largest outbreak areas in South Korea  however  resilience and family cohesion reduced these negative consequences both directly and indirectly  Findings are discussed and implications are addressed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935533
693,OBJECTIVE  The direct and indirect mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are considerable  However  it is unclear how suicidal ideation was affected in communities during the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic  and over the longer-term  This study provides longitudinal data on the prevalence of  and risk factors for  suicidal ideation in the Australian national population  during the pandemic  METHOD  The Australian National COVID-19 Mental Health and Risk Communication Survey assessed a nationally representative sample of Australian adults  N   1296  fortnightly for 12 weeks from late-March to June 2020  7 waves   and again in March 2021  wave 8   Cox proportional hazards models examined demographic and pandemic-related risk factors for suicidal ideation over time  RESULTS  Prevalence of suicidal ideation was high but steady at approximately 18  across the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic  and 16 2  in March 2021  People who had direct experience with COVID-19  tested  diagnosed  or contact with someone who was diagnosed  had increased risk for suicidal ideation  Higher pandemic-related work and social impairment  recent adversity  loneliness  and being younger were also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation over time  CONCLUSION  Both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 were associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation over time  although prevalence did not vary over time  The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in our sample flags a critical need for accessible mental health support  and findings provide insights into the factors placing people at risk during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995704
8779,Background  Brazil has faced two simultaneous problems related to respiratory health  forest fires and the high mortality rate due to COVID-19 pandemics  The Amazon rain forest is one of the Brazilian biomes that suffers the most with fires caused by droughts and illegal deforestation  These fires can bring respiratory diseases associated with air pollution  and the State of Para in Brazil is the most affected  COVID-19 pandemics associated with air pollution can potentially increase hospitalizations and deaths related to respiratory diseases  Here  we aimed to evaluate the association of fire occurrences with the COVID-19 mortality rates and general respiratory diseases hospitalizations in the State of Para  Brazil  Methods  We employed machine learning technique for clustering k-means accompanied with the elbow method used to identify the ideal quantity of clusters for the k-means algorithm  clustering 10 groups of cities in the State of Para where we selected the clusters with the highest and lowest fires occurrence from the 2015 to 2019  Next  an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average Exogenous  ARIMAX  model was proposed to study the serial correlation of respiratory diseases hospitalizations and their associations with fire occurrences  Regarding the COVID-19 analysis  we computed the mortality risk and its confidence level considering the quarterly incidence rate ratio in clusters with high and low exposure to fires  Findings  Using the k-means algorithm we identified two clusters with similar DHI  Development Human Index  and GDP  Gross Domestic Product  from a group of ten clusters that divided the State of Para but with diverse behavior considering the hospitalizations and forest fires in the Amazon biome  From the auto-regressive and moving average model  ARIMAX   it was possible to show that besides the serial correlation  the fires occurrences contribute to the respiratory diseases increase  with an observed lag of six months after the fires for the case with high exposure to fires  A highlight that deserves attention concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and deaths  Historically  the risk of mortality by respiratory diseases is higher  about the double  in regions and periods with high exposure to fires than the ones with low exposure to fires  The same pattern remains in the period of the COVID-19 pandemic  where the risk of mortality for COVID-19 was 80  higher in the region and period with high exposure to fires  Regarding the SARS-COV-2 analysis  the risk of mortality related to COVID-19 is higher in the period with high exposure to fires than in the period with low exposure to fires  Another highlight concerns the relationship between fire occurrences and COVID-19 deaths  The results show that regions with high fire occurrences are associated with more cases of COVID deaths  Interpretation  The decision-make process is a critical problem mainly when it involves environmental and health control policies  Environmental policies are often more cost-effective as health measures than the use of public health services  This highlight the importance of data analyses to support the decision making and to identify population in need of better infrastructure due to historical environmental factors and the knowledge of associated health risk  The results suggest that The fires occurrences contribute to the increase of the respiratory diseases hospitalization  The mortality rate related to COVID-19 was higher for the period with high exposure to fires than the period with low exposure to fires  The regions with high fire occurrences is associated with more COVID-19 deaths  mainly in the months with high number of fires  Funding  No additional funding source was required for this study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870262

9242,BACKGROUND  Despite the clear benefits of vaccination  their uptake against common infectious diseases is suboptimal  In December 2020  vaccines against COVID-19 became available  PURPOSE  To determine factors that predict who will take the COVID-19 vaccine based on a conceptual model  METHODS  An online survey was administered twice  prior to public vaccination  and after vaccinations were available  Participants were 309 Israelis with initial data and 240 at follow-up  Baseline questionnaires measured intentions to be vaccinated and hypothesized predictors clustered in four categories  background  COVID-19  vaccination  and social factors  Self-reported vaccination uptake was measured at follow-up  RESULTS  Sixty-two percent of the sample reported having been vaccinated  Intentions were strongly associated with vaccination uptake and mediated the effects of other predictors on behavior  Eighty-six percent of the variance in vaccination intentions was explained by attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination  regret for having declined vaccination  trust in vaccination  vaccination barriers  past flu vaccination  perceived social norms  and COVID-19 representations  CONCLUSIONS  Beliefs related directly to the COVID-19 vaccine explained most of the variance in intentions to vaccinate  which in turn predicted vaccination uptake,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864833
9798,BACKGROUND  In the past months  several lung ultrasonography  LUS  protocols have been proposed  mainly on previously validated schemes independent of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   OBJECTIVES  The main purpose of this study was to determine the impact and accuracy of different LUS protocols proposed in COVID-19  METHODS  Patients were evaluated with a standard sequence of LUS scans in 72 intercostal spaces along 14 anatomic lines in the chest  A scoring system of LUS findings was reported and then analyzed separately according to each proposed LUS protocol zones  This score was then correlated to a validated Pulmonary Inflammation Index  PII  on chest Computed Tomography  CT   RESULTS  Thirty-two patients were enrolled  The most frequent pattern was ground-glass opacities in the chest X-ray  53 1    chest CT  59 1   and subpleural or lobar consolidations  40 8   in the posteroinferior areas  p < 0 001  on LUS  The Interclass Correlation Coefficient  ICC  was significantly correlated with almost every protocol analyzed except the 8-zone  p   0 119  and the 10-zone protocol that only included one posterior point  p   0 052   The highest ICC was obtained with a 12-zone protocol  ICC 0 500  p   0 027  and decreased as more points were included  CONCLUSIONS  In conclusion  our study results suggest that performing an ultrasound protocol with 12-zone scanning  including the superior and inferior areas of the anterior  lateral and posterior regions of the chest was consistent with higher ICC and higher degree of concordance with CT  We emphasize the need of a more standardization technique to further implement and develop this imaging modality in COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855187
3412,The Covid-19 pandemic has caused millions of deaths worldwide  Although vaccines have been developed  patients on immunosuppressive therapy are less likely to respond  This study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of a Covid-19 vaccine  Pfizer-BioNTech  in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies  Only 1 of 28 lymphoma patients  3 6   developed a seropositive response  compared with 100   28 28  of the healthy volunteers  The low levels of CD19    lymphocytes among the lymphoma patients suggest that anti-CD20 treatment prevents the seropositive response to the vaccine  An additional vaccination might be indicated in these patients once B cells are repopulated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952139
3233,The social distancing required during Covid-19 times tended to make people feel lonelier than usual  Those with pets might  however  have experienced this less  because pets are known for fostering their owners  subjective well-being  Building on a recently published structural equation model  our study enhances the understanding of subjective well-being by including the construct social distancing during Covid-19 times  In order to answer our research question-How does human-pet relationship need support influence subjective well-being by considering social isolation during Covid-19 times -we build on the basic needs theory  assuming that humans as well as their pets have an inherent need of autonomy  relatedness  and competence  Using a multivariate data analysis method  namely partial least squares structural equation modeling  PLS-SEM   we establish a path model and examine the relationship between human-pet relationship need support and subjective well-being by including psychological distress and social isolation during Covid-19 times as mediators  We operationalize subjective well-being as a three-dimensional construct consisting of positive affect  happiness  and life satisfaction  In a sample of 215 pet owners in the USA  supporting their need increases subjective well-being  and decreases the psychological distress and loneliness caused by social isolation during Covid-19 times  Furthermore  psychological distress decreases subjective well-being  whereas perceived loneliness during Covid-19 times does not  Our main contributions are to not only enhance our knowledge on the importance of human-pet relationships in critical times  but also to provide policy makers with insights into what influences people s subjective well-being  which is closely related to their psychological health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955563
6373,BACKGROUND  Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination may display subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography  which can appear suspicious for malignancy  leading to additional diagnostic evaluation  PURPOSE  To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy  sLAD  on screening mammogram in women who received either the first or second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech  Pfizer  or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines compared to women who have not  MATERIALS AND METHODS  In this IRB-approved  HIPAA complaint study from 12 14 2020 to 4 14 2021  1027 patients presented for screening mammography and met study inclusion criteria  Patients with history of baseline lymphadenopathy or prior cancer diagnosis were excluded  RESULTS  Of the 1027 women  43 were recalled for unilateral sLAD  34 women received a COVID-19 vaccination ipsilateral to the sLAD  Pfizer n 19  44 2   Moderna n 15  34 9    9 did not  20 9    Incidence of unilateral axillary sLAD was significantly higher  p-value<0 01  in those who received a COVID-19 vaccination within approximately 7 weeks preceding screening mammogram  13 2  of patients who received the Pfizer vaccine and 9 5  of patients who received the Moderna vaccine developed sLAD  Moderna s vaccine elicited a more robust reaction in the elderly  Moderna 63 7 years vs  Pfizer 59 7 years   For both vaccines  sLAD resolved on average 46 5 days after the last COVID-19 vaccine  p 0 44   CONCLUSION  Women who have received either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may benefit from scheduling their screening mammogram before vaccination or consider delaying screening mammography 8 weeks  While Pfizer may have an overall more robust immune response  Moderna may elicit a stronger immune response in elderly women  SUMMARY  Women who received a COVID-19 vaccination before screening mammography were significantly more likely to present with subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy than women who did not receive the vaccine  KEY RESULTS  13 2  of women who received a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine exhibited subclinical axillary lymphadenopathy compared to 9 5  of those who received the Moderna vaccine  Only 1 2   of those who did not receive a vaccine presented with subclinical unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy  The average time of resolution of the lymphadenopathy on diagnostic mammogram was 46 5 days overall  with Pfizer-BioNTech taking 50 7 days and Moderna 41 5 days,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906409
8398,OBJECTIVES  To investigate whether calcium derangement was a specific feature of COVID-19 that distinguishes it from other infective pneumonias  and its association with disease severity  DESIGN  A retrospective observational case-control study looking at serum calcium on adult patients with COVID-19  and community-acquired pneumonia  CAP  or viral pneumonia  VP   SETTING  A district general hospital on the outskirts of London  UK  PARTICIPANTS  506 patients with COVID-19  95 patients with CAP and 152 patients with VP  OUTCOME MEASURES  Baseline characteristics including hypocalcaemia in patients with COVID-19  CAP and VP were detailed  For patients with COVID-19  the impact of an abnormally low calcium level on the maximum level of hospital care  as a surrogate of COVID-19 severity  was evaluated  The primary outcome of maximal level of care was based on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale for COVID-19  RESULTS  Hypocalcaemia was a specific and common clinical finding in patients with COVID-19 that distinguished it from other respiratory infections  Calcium levels were significantly lower in those with severe disease  Ordinal regression of risk estimates for categorised care levels showed that baseline hypocalcaemia was incrementally associated with OR of 2 33  95  CI 1 5 to 3 61  for higher level of care  superior to other variables that have previously been shown to predict worse COVID-19 outcome  Serial calcium levels showed improvement by days 7-9 of admission  only in survivors of COVID-19  CONCLUSION  Hypocalcaemia is specific to COVID-19 and may help distinguish it from other infective pneumonias  Hypocalcaemia may independently predict severe disease and warrants detailed prognostic investigation  The fact that decreased serum calcium is observed at the time of clinical presentation in COVID-19  but not other infective pneumonias  suggests that its early derangement is pathophysiological and may influence the deleterious evolution of this disease  TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER  20 HRA 2344,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876435
8466,BACKGROUND  Telogen Effluvium  TE  in a post-Covid-19 patient causes excessive shedding of hair  No definite treatment is available till now  Past studies demonstrates that QR678Neo  R   has shown promising results in various types of Alopecia  AIM  In this study  we aim to establish efficacy of QR678 Neo  R   hair growth factor formulation administration in Covid-19-induced persistent TE for treatment of hair loss and for hair regrowth  MATERIAL   METHOD  Twenty adult patients  all females  presenting with persistent TE starting few weeks after recovery from Covid-19 infection  and continuing beyond 6 months were included for the study  A 1 5 mL solution of QR678 Neo  R   hair growth factor formulation was administered in the scalp per session  A total of 8 sessions  one session every 4 weeks  were done  The results were assessed at the baseline  after 4thsession  and 1 month after 8th session  RESULTS  Most of the patients showed significant reduction in hair fall  89  patients showed excellent hair growth  Global photographic assessment score showed marked improvement  which maintained even post therapy  Videomicroscopic assessment showed increase in the hair count  mean  29 32  after 8th session  that further improved even post therapy  The subjective assessment scores for overall hair growth  appearance of hair  reduction in visibility of the scalp  and hair loss were 4  4 5  4 25  and 5  respectively  CONCLUSION  Management of Covid-19-induced persistent Telogen Effluvium has been unclear and futile so far  Intra-dermal administration of QR678 Neo  R   hair growth factor formulation in the scalp  reduces hair fall  improves hair regrowth  and increases the hair density,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875139

5140,We assess the detectability of COVID-like emissions reductions in global atmospheric CO2 concentrations using a suite of large ensembles conducted with an Earth system model  We find a unique fingerprint of COVID in the simulated growth rate of CO2 sampled at the locations of surface measurement sites  Negative anomalies in growth rates persist from January 2020 through December 2021  reaching a maximum in February 2021  However  this fingerprint is not formally detectable unless we force the model with unrealistically large emissions reductions  2 or 4 times the observed reductions   Internal variability and carbon-concentration feedbacks obscure the detectability of short-term emission reductions in atmospheric CO2  COVID-driven changes in the simulated  column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 are eclipsed by large internal variability  Carbon-concentration feedbacks begin to operate almost immediately after the emissions reduction  these feedbacks reduce the emissions-driven signal in the atmosphere carbon reservoir and further confound signal detection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924639
841,SARS-CoV-2  the virus that causes coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19   is associated with a bewildering array of cardiovascular manifestations  including myocardial infarction and stroke  myocarditis and heart failure  atrial and ventricular arrhythmias  venous thromboembolism  and microvascular disease  Accumulating evidence indicates that a profound disturbance of endothelial homeostasis contributes to these conditions  Furthermore  the pulmonary infiltration and edema  and later pulmonary fibrosis  in patients with COVID-19 is promoted by endothelial alterations including the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules and chemokines  increased intercellular permeability  and endothelial-to-mesenchyme transitions  The cognitive disturbance occurring in this disease may also be due in part to an impairment of the blood-brain barrier  Venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism are most likely associated with an endothelial defect caused by circulating inflammatory cytokines and or direct endothelial invasion by the virus  Endothelial-targeted therapies such as statins  nitric oxide donors  and antioxidants may be useful therapeutic adjuncts in COVID-19 by restoring endothelial homeostasis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992723
6634,PURPOSE  In this study we aimed to leverage deep learning to develop a computer aided diagnosis  CAD  system toward helping radiologists in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus syndrome on Lung ultrasonography  LUS   METHOD  A CAD system is developed based on a transfer learning of a residual network  ResNet  to extract features on LUS and help radiologists to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 virus syndrome from healthy and non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia  A publicly available LUS dataset for SARS-CoV-2 virus syndrome consisting of 3909 images has been employed  Six radiologists with different experiences participated in the experiment  A comprehensive LUS data set was constructed and employed to train and verify the proposed method  Several metrics such as accuracy  recall  precision  and F1-score  are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed CAD approach  The performances of the radiologists with and without the help of CAD are also evaluated quantitively  The p-values of the t-test shows that with the help of the CAD system  both junior and senior radiologists significantly improve their diagnosis performance on both balanced and unbalanced datasets  RESULTS  Experimental results indicate the proposed CAD approach and the machine features from it can significantly improve the radiologists  performance in the SARS-CoV-2 virus syndrome diagnosis  With the help of the proposed CAD system  the junior and senior radiologists achieved F1-score values of 91 33  and 95 79  on balanced dataset and 94 20  and 96 43  on unbalanced dataset  The proposed approach is verified on an independent test dataset and reports promising performance  CONCLUSIONS  The proposed CAD system reports promising performance in facilitating radiologists  diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 virus syndrome and might assist the development of a fast  accessible screening method for pulmonary diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902668
1614,OBJECTIVE  The primary objective of the study was to compare the challenges in implementing various COVID-19-related public health strategies and activities between the selected high health index and low health index states  The secondary objective was to identify the differently managed mechanisms adopted by the health-care delivery system across the states to maintain their functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic  SETTING  Eight states were divided into two groups  based on their health index and vulnerability index ranking-Kerala  Maharashtra  Gujarat  and Karnataka in top four  Group 1  and Delhi  Tripura  Rajasthan  and Orissa in bottom four states  Group 2   RESULTS  There was lack of private sector involvement in both the groups of the states  more so in Group 2  Although transport-related issues were similar in both groups  lack of provision of vehicles for transport for carrying out various COVID and non-COVID activities seemed to be more prominent in Group 2  More obstacles related to infrastructure were observed in Group 1 states  In terms of innovations  commonalities lay in convergence of multiple departments for monitoring  contact tracing  essential supplies  and transportation  Both groups managed routine health services and fund allocation with nearly equal vigour  Major challenges faced were related to human resource  policy management  transportation  routine health services  data management  and infrastructure  HR-related challenges in top four states included confusion due to frequent change in guidelines  unclear micro-containment  and testing guidelines  Discharge guidelines and SOPs related to home isolation of slum dwellers  inter-departmental cooperation and coordination issues faced in greater proportion in top four states  issues with fund allocation for local needs were faced by the Group 2 states  Innovations implemented to meet hurdles faced during the pandemic could be categorized under heads of  human resource    community actions    policy management    inter-departmental coordination    use of technology and media   and  fund allocations   There was private-public partnership  use of other human resource for health-care delivery  use of technology for health-care delivery was seen in all states but more so in Group 1 states  CONCLUSION  States with higher health index and lower vulnerability index  i e   Group 1 states faced fewer challenges than those in Group 2  Innovative measures taken at local level to tackle problems posed by the pandemic were unique to the situations presented to them and helped control the disease as effectively as they could,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978706

3316,SARS-CoV-2 is the RNA virus responsible for COVID-19  the prognosis of which has been found to be slightly worse in men  The present study aimed to analyze the expression of different mRNAs and their regulatory molecules  miRNAs and lncRNAs  to consider the potential existence of sex-specific expression patterns and COVID-19 susceptibility using bioinformatics analysis  The binding sites of all human mature miRNA sequences on the SARS-CoV-2 genome nucleotide sequence were predicted by the miRanda tool  Sequencing data was excavated using the Galaxy web server from GSE157103  and the output of feature counts was analyzed using DEseq2 packages to obtain differentially expressed genes  DEGs   Gene set enrichment analysis  GSEA  and DEG annotation analyses were performed using the ToppGene and Metascape tools  Using the RNA Interactome Database  we predicted interactions between differentially expressed lncRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs  Finally  their networks were constructed with top miRNAs  We identified 11 miRNAs with three to five binding sites on the SARS-COVID-2 genome reference  MiR-29c-3p  miR-21-3p  and miR-6838-5p occupied four binding sites  and miR-29a-3p had five binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome  Moreover  miR-29a-3p  and miR-29c-3p were the top miRNAs targeting DEGs  The expression levels of miRNAs  125  181b  130a  29a  b  c  212  181a  133a  changed in males with COVID-19  in whom they regulated ACE2 expression and affected the immune response by affecting phagosomes  complement activation  and cell-matrix adhesion  Our results indicated that XIST lncRNA was up-regulated  and TTTY14  TTTY10  and ZFY-AS1 lncRN as were down-regulated in both ICU and non-ICU men with COVID-19  Dysregulation of noncoding-RNAs has critical effects on the pathophysiology of men with COVID-19  which is why they may be used as biomarkers and therapeutic agents  Overall  our results indicated that the miR-29 family target regulation patterns and might become promising biomarkers for severity and survival outcome in men with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954105
8771,To better understand the mechanisms at the basis of neutrophil functions during SARS-CoV-2  we studied patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia  They had high blood proportion of degranulated neutrophils and elevated plasma levels of myeloperoxidase  MPO   elastase  and MPO-DNA complexes  which are typical markers of neutrophil extracellular traps  NET   Their neutrophils display dysfunctional mitochondria  defective oxidative burst  increased glycolysis  glycogen accumulation in the cytoplasm  and increase glycogenolysis  Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha  EtaIotaF-1alpha  is stabilized in such cells  and it controls the level of glycogen phosphorylase L  PYGL   a key enzyme in glycogenolysis  Inhibiting PYGL abolishes the ability of neutrophils to produce NET  Patients displayed significant increases of plasma levels of molecules involved in the regulation of neutrophils  function including CCL2  CXCL10  CCL20  IL-18  IL-3  IL-6  G-CSF  GM-CSF  IFN-gamma  Our data suggest that metabolic remodelling is vital for the formation of NET and for boosting neutrophil inflammatory response  thus  suggesting that modulating EtaIotaF-1alpha or PYGL could represent a novel approach for innovative therapies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870329
4489,The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased attention to the critical mathematical literacy of citizens in the United States and around the world  A statistically and mathematically literate society is crucial for ensuring that citizens are able to sift through political rhetoric to maintain life-saving procedures such as social distancing and other infection dampening efforts  Additionally  recent civil unrest due to the disproportionate killings of Black men by police provokes investigation into the public s mathematical literacy  In this paper  we investigate adolescent students  critical mathematics consciousness and mathematics literacy as they reason through two interview tasks on the coronavirus and police shooting data  Drawing on Frankenstein s program of Critical Mathematics Education  we introduce an analytic framework for documenting the critical mathematics consciousness of adolescent students  We interviewed fifteen 14- to 16-year-old students as they solved five tasks designed to elicit their critical and ethical mathematical awareness  Our findings indicate that students exhibit very little critical mathematics consciousness in the context of the police problem but show awareness that data can be presented in ways that manipulate the public s emotions in the coronavirus problem  We conclude the paper with a discussion of implications for designing future instruction to support students  growth in critical mathematics consciousness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934232
2602,The COVID-19 pandemic is going into its third year with Europe again being the focus of major epidemic activity  The present review tries to answer the question whether one can come to grip with the pandemic by a combination of vaccinations and non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs   Several COVID-19 vaccines are of remarkable efficacy and achieve high protection rates against symptomatic disease  especially severe disease  but mathematical models suggest that the current vaccination coverage in many countries is insufficient to achieve pandemic control  NPIs are needed as complementary measures because recent research has also revealed the limits of vaccination alone  Here  we review the evidence for efficacy of face mask wearing in various settings  Overall pooled analysis showed significant reduction in COVID-19 incidence with mask wearing  although heterogeneity between studies was substantial  Controlled trials of mask wearing are difficult to conduct  separating mask wearing effects in population studies from the impact of other NPIs is challenging and the efficacy of masks depend on mask material and mask fit  The combination of vaccination and mask wearing is potentially synergistic since vaccination protects so far well from disease development  the omicron variant is currently an unknown  but immunity from infection wanes over few months after vaccination  In comparison  masks interfere with the virus transmission process at a level of a physical barrier independent of coronavirus variant  Vaccination and masks are much less costly to apply than other NPI measures which are associated with high economic and social costs  but paradoxically both measures are the target of a vocal opposition by a sizable minority of the society  In parallel with biomedical research  we need more social science research into this opposition to guide political decisions on how to end the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962710
881,The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century with more than 257 million cases and over 5 17 million deaths reported worldwide  as of November 23  2021  Various agents were initially proclaimed to be effective against SARS-CoV-2  the etiological agent of COVID-19  Hydroxychloroquine  lopinavir ritonavir  and ribavirin are all examples of therapeutic agents  whose efficacy against COVID-19 was later disproved  Meanwhile  concentrated efforts of researchers and clinicians worldwide have led to the identification of novel therapeutic options to control the disease including PAXLOVID  PF-07321332   Although COVID-19 cases are currently treated using a comprehensive approach of anticoagulants  oxygen  and antibiotics  the novel Pfizer agent PAXLOVID  PF-07321332   an investigational COVID-19 oral antiviral candidate  significantly reduced hospitalization time and death rates  based on an interim analysis of the phase 2 3 EPIC-HR  Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients  randomized  double-blind study of non-hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19  who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness  The scheduled interim analysis demonstrated an 89   reduction in risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause compared to placebo in patients treated within three days of symptom onset  primary endpoint   However  there still exists a great need for the development of additional treatments  as the recommended therapeutic options are insufficient in many cases  Thus far  mRNA and vector vaccines appear to be the most effective modalities to control the pandemic  In the current review  we provide an update on the progress that has been made since April 2020 in clinical trials concerning the effectiveness of therapies available to combat COVID-19  We focus on currently recommended therapeutic agents  including steroids  various monoclonal antibodies  remdesivir  baricitinib  anticoagulants and PAXLOVID summarizing the latest original studies and meta-analyses  Moreover  we aim to discuss other currently and previously studied agents targeting COVID-19 that either show no or only limited therapeutic activity  The results of recent studies report that hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma demonstrate no efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection  Lastly  we summarize the studies on various drugs with incoherent or insufficient data concerning their effectiveness  such as amantadine  ivermectin  or niclosamide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34991982

8546,Lipidoid nanoparticles  LNPs  are the delivery platform in Onpattro  the first FDA-approved siRNA drug  LNPs are also the carriers in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines  While these applications have demonstrated that LNPs effectively deliver nucleic acids to hepatic and muscle cells  it is unclear if LNPs could be used for delivery of siRNA to neural cells  which are notoriously challenging delivery targets  Therefore  the purpose of this study was to determine if LNPs could efficiently deliver siRNA to neurons  Because of their potential delivery utility in either applications for the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system  we used both cortical neurons and sensory neurons  We prepared siRNA-LNPs using C12-200  a benchmark ionizable cationic lipidoid along with helper lipids  We demonstrated using dynamic light scattering that the inclusion of both siRNA and PEG-lipid provided a stabilizing effect to the LNP particle diameters and polydispersity indices by minimizing aggregation  We found that siRNA-LNPs were safely tolerated by primary dorsal root ganglion neurons  Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Cy5 siRNA delivered via LNPs into rat primary cortical neurons showed uptake levels similar to Lipofectamine RNAiMAX-the gold standard commercial transfection agent  However  LNPs demonstrated a superior safety profile  whereas the Lipofectamine-mediated uptake was concomitant with significant toxicity  Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated a time-dependent increase in the uptake of LNP-delivered Cy5 siRNA in a human cortical neuron cell line  Overall  our results suggest that LNPs are a viable platform that can be optimized for delivery of therapeutic siRNAs to neural cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873640
6521,The speed by which the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world makes the emergency services unprepared to answer all the patients  requests  The Tunisian ministry of health established a protocol planning the sample collection from the patients at their location  A triage score is first assigned to each patient according to the symptoms he is showing  and his health conditions  Then  given the limited number of the available ambulances in each area  the location of the patients and the capacity of the nearby hospitals for receiving the testing samples  an ambulance scheduling and routing plan needs to be established so that specimens can be transferred to hospitals in short time  In this paper  we propose to model this problem as a Multi-Origin-Destination Team Orienteering Problem  MODTOP   The objective is to find the optimal one day tour plan for the available ambulances that maximizes the collected scores of visited patients while respecting duration and capacity constraints  To solve this NP-hard problem  two highly effective approaches are proposed which are Hybrid Genetic Algorithm  HGA  and Memetic Algorithm  MA   The HGA combines  i  a k-means construction method for initial population generation and  ii  a one point crossover operator for solution recombination  The MA is an improvement of HGA that integrates an effective local search based on three different neighborhood structures  Computational experiments  supported by a statistical analysis on benchmark data sets  illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approaches  HGA and MA reached the best known solutions in 54 7  and 73 5  of instances  respectively  Likewise  MA reached a relative error of 0 0675  and performed better than four existing approaches  Real-case instances derived from the city of Tunis were also solved and compared with the results of an exact solver Cplex to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903957
1123,We developed a dual-mode surface-enhanced Raman scattering  SERS -based aptasensor that can accurately diagnose and distinguish severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and influenza A H1N1 at the same time  Herein  DNA aptamers that selectively bind to SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A H1N1 were immobilized together on Au nanopopcorn substrate  Raman reporters  Cy3 and RRX   attached to the terminal of DNA aptamers  could generate strong SERS signals in the nanogap of the Au nanopopcorn substrate  Additionally  the internal standard Raman reporter  4-MBA  was immobilized on the Au nanopopcorn substrate along with aptamer DNAs to reduce errors caused by changes in the measurement environment  When SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus approaches the Au nanopopcorn substrate  the corresponding DNA aptamer selectively detaches from the substrate due to the significant binding affinity between the corresponding DNA aptamer and the virus  As a result  the related SERS intensity decreases with increasing target virus concentration  Thus  it is possible to determine whether a suspected patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A using this SERS-based DNA aptasensor  Furthermore  this sensor enables a quantitative evaluation of the target virus concentration with high sensitivity without being affected by cross-reactivity  Therefore  this SERS-based diagnostic platform is considered a conceptually new diagnostic tool that rapidly discriminates against these two respiratory diseases to prevent their spread,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987275
6325,We demonstrate that finite impulse response  FIR  models can be applied to analyze the time evolution of an epidemic with its impact on deaths and healthcare strain  Using time series data for COVID-19-related cases  ICU admissions and deaths from Sweden  the FIR model gives a consistent epidemiological trajectory for a simple delta filter function  This results in a consistent scaling between the time series if appropriate time delays are applied and allows the reconstruction of cases for times before July 2020  when RT-PCR testing was not widely available  Combined with randomized RT-PCR study results  we utilize this approach to estimate the total number of infections in Sweden  and the corresponding infection-to-fatality ratio  IFR   infection-to-case ratio  ICR   and infection-to-ICU admission ratio  IIAR   Our values for IFR  ICR and IIAR are essentially constant over large parts of 2020 in contrast with claims of healthcare adaptation or mutated virus variants importantly affecting these ratios  We observe a diminished IFR in late summer 2020 as well as a strong decline during 2021  following the launch of a nation-wide vaccination program  The total number of infections during 2020 is estimated to 1 3 million  indicating that Sweden was far from herd immunity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907208
5328,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is an infectious disease that can present as an uncontrolled  hyperactive immune response  causing severe immunological injury  Existing rodent models do not recapitulate the sustained immunopathology of patients with severe disease  Here we describe a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 that uses adeno-associated virus to deliver human ACE2 to the lungs of humanized MISTRG6 mice  This model recapitulates innate and adaptive human immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection up to 28 days after infection  with key features of chronic COVID-19  including weight loss  persistent viral RNA  lung pathology with fibrosis  a human inflammatory macrophage response  a persistent interferon-stimulated gene signature and T cell lymphopenia  We used this model to study two therapeutics on immunopathology  patient-derived antibodies and steroids and found that the same inflammatory macrophages crucial to containing early infection later drove immunopathology  This model will enable evaluation of COVID-19 disease mechanisms and treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921308

3463,Purpose Over the last two years  the artificial intelligence  AI  community has presented several automatic screening tools for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  based on chest radiography  CXR   with reported accuracies often well over 90   However  it has been noted that many of these studies have likely suffered from dataset bias  leading to overly optimistic results  The purpose of this study was to thoroughly investigate to what extent biases have influenced the performance of a range of previously proposed and promising convolutional neural networks  CNNs   and to determine what performance can be expected with current CNNs on a realistic and unbiased dataset  Methods Five CNNs for COVID-19 positive negative classification were implemented for evaluation  namely VGG19  ResNet50  InceptionV3  DenseNet201 and COVID-Net  To perform both internal and cross-dataset evaluations  four datasets were created  The first dataset  BIMCV  followed strict reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  test criteria and was created from a single reliable open access databank  while the second dataset  COVIDxB8  was created through a combination of six online CXR repositories  The third and fourth dataset were created by combining the opposing classes from the BIMCV and COVIDxB8 datasets  To decrease inter-dataset variability  a pre-processing workflow of resizing  normalization and histogram equalization was applied to all datasets  Classification performance was evaluated on unseen test sets using precision and recall  A qualitative sanity check was performed by evaluating saliency maps displaying the top 5   10  and 20  most salient segments in the input CXRs  to evaluate whether the CNNs were using relevant information for decision making  In an additional experiment and to further investigate the origin of potential dataset bias  all pixel values outside the lungs were set to zero through automatic lung segmentation before training and testing  Results When trained and evaluated on the single online source dataset  BIMCV   performance of all CNNs is relatively low  precision  0 65-0 72  recall  0 59-0 71   but remains relatively consistent during external evaluation  precision  0 58-0 82  recall  0 57-0 72   To the contrary  when trained and internally evaluated on the combinatory datasets  all CNNs performed well across all metrics  precision  0 94-1 00  recall  0 77-1 00   However  when subsequently evaluated cross-dataset  results dropped substantially  precision  0 10-0 61  recall  0 04-0 80   For all datasets  saliency maps revealed the CNNs rarely focus on areas inside the lungs for their decision making  However  even when setting all pixel values outside the lungs to zero  classification performance does not change and dataset bias remains  Conclusions Results in this study confirm that when trained on a combinatory dataset  CNNs tend to learn the origin of the CXRs rather than the presence or absence of disease  a behavior known as short-cut learning  The bias is shown to originate from differences in overall pixel values rather than embedded text or symbols  despite consistent image pre-processing  When trained on a reliable  and realistic single-source dataset in which non-lung pixels have been masked  CNNs currently show limited sensitivity  < 70   for COVID-19 infection in CXR  questioning their use as a reliable automatic screening tool  HIGHLIGHTS Quantitative and qualitative analysis confirm many deep learning-based screening tools for COVID-19 based on chest radiography have likely suffered from dataset bias Generation of saliency maps shows that good performance in external evaluation does not guarantee reliable neural network performance Lung segmentation shows dataset bias is due to differences in overall intensities between datasets  despite normalization and histogram equalization  rather than embedded text symbols COVID-19 sensitivity and precision with current neural network architectures in case of no dataset bias and reliable imaging data is below 70  This article is protected by copyright  All rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951033
6603,A new platform for creating anti-coronavirus epitope vaccines has been developed  Two loop-like epitopes with lengths of 22 and 42 amino acid residues were selected from the receptor-binding motif of the Spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that participate in a large number of protein-protein interactions in the complexes with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies  Two types of hybrid proteins  including one of the two selected epitopes  were constructed  To fix conformation of the selected epitopes  an approach using protein scaffolds was used  The homologue of Rop protein from the Escherichia coli ColE1 plasmid containing helix-turn-helix motif was used as an epitope scaffold for the convergence of C- and N-termini of the loop-like epitopes  Loop epitopes were inserted into the turn region  The conformation was additionally fixed by a disulfide bond formed between the cysteine residues present within the epitopes  For the purpose of multimerization  either aldolase from Thermotoga maritima  which forms a trimer in solution  or alpha-helical trimerizer of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2  was attached to the epitopes incorporated into the Rop-like protein  To enable purification on the heparin-containing sorbents  a short fragment from the heparin-binding hemagglutinin of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was inserted at the C-terminus of the hybrid proteins  All the obtained proteins demonstrated high level of immunogenicity after triplicate parenteral administration to mice  Sera from the mice immunized with both aldolase-based hybrid proteins and the Spike protein SARS-CoV-2 trimerizer-based protein with a longer epitope interacted with both the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Spike protein receptor-binding domain at high titers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903153
6551,Short-term forecasts of traditional streams from public health reporting  such as cases  hospitalizations  and deaths  are a key input to public health decision-making during a pandemic  Since early 2020  our research group has worked with data partners to collect  curate  and make publicly available numerous real-time COVID-19 indicators  providing multiple views of pandemic activity in the United States  This paper studies the utility of five such indicators-derived from deidentified medical insurance claims  self-reported symptoms from online surveys  and COVID-related Google search activity-from a forecasting perspective  For each indicator  we ask whether its inclusion in an autoregressive  AR  model leads to improved predictive accuracy relative to the same model excluding it  Such an AR model  without external features  is already competitive with many top COVID-19 forecasting models in use today  Our analysis reveals that 1  inclusion of each of these five indicators improves on the overall predictive accuracy of the AR model  2  predictive gains are in general most pronounced during times in which COVID cases are trending in  flat  or  down  directions  and 3  one indicator  based on Google searches  seems to be particularly helpful during  up  trends,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903655
7100,The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 led to explosive growth in scientific research  Alas  much of the research in the literature lacks conditions to be reproducible  and recent publications on the association between population density and the basic reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 are no exception  Relatively few papers share code and data sufficiently  which hinders not only verification but additional experimentation  In this article  an example of reproducible research shows the potential of spatial analysis for epidemiology research during COVID-19  Transparency and openness means that independent researchers can  with only modest efforts  verify findings and use different approaches as appropriate  Given the high stakes of the situation  it is essential that scientific findings  on which good policy depends  are as robust as possible  as the empirical example shows  reproducibility is one of the keys to ensure this,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898693
3312,The classic Wells-Riley model is widely used for estimation of the transmission risk of airborne pathogens in indoor spaces  However  the predictive capability of this zero-dimensional model is limited as it does not resolve the highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of airborne pathogens  and the infection risk is poorly quantified for many pathogens  In this study we address these shortcomings by developing a novel spatiotemporally resolved Wells-Riley model for prediction of the transmission risk of different COVID-19 variants in indoor environments  This modelling framework properly accounts for airborne infection risk by incorporating the latest clinical data regarding viral shedding by COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infecting human cells  The spatiotemporal distribution of airborne pathogens is determined via computational fluid dynamics  CFD  simulations of airflow and aerosol transport  leading to an integrated model of infection risk associated with the exposure to SARS-CoV-2  which can produce quantitative 3D infection risk map for a specific SARS-CoV-2 variant in a given indoor space  Application of this model to airborne COVID-19 transmission within a hospital ward demonstrates the impact of different virus variants and respiratory PPE upon transmission risk  With the emergence of highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the Delta and Omicron strains  respiratory PPE alone may not provide effective protection  These findings suggest a combination of optimal ventilation and respiratory PPE must be developed to effectively control the transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare settings and indoor spaces in general  This generalised risk estimation framework has the flexibility to incorporate further clinical data as such becomes available  and can be readily applied to consider a wide range of factors that impact transmission risk  including location and movement of infectious persons  virus variant and stage of infection  level of PPE and vaccination of infectious and susceptible individuals  impacts of coughing  sneezing  talking and breathing  and natural and mechanised ventilation and filtration,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954184
6005,Background  Delta has outcompeted most preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2  becoming the globally predominant lineage by mid-2021  Its subsequent evolution has led to emergence of multiple sublineages  many of which are well-mixed between countries  Aim  Here  we aim to study the emergence and spread of the Delta lineage in Russia  Methods  We use a phylogeographic approach to infer imports of Delta sublineages into Russia  and phylodynamic models to assess the rate of their spread  Results  We show that nearly the entire Delta epidemic in Russia has probably descended from a single import event despite genetic evidence of multiple Delta imports  Indeed  over 90  of Delta samples in Russia are characterized by the nsp2 K81N ORF7a P45L pair of mutations which is rare outside Russia  putting them in the AY 122 sublineage  The AY 122 lineage was frequent in Russia among Delta samples from the start  and has not increased in frequency in other countries where it has been observed  suggesting that its high prevalence in Russia has probably resulted from a random founder effect  Conclusion  The apartness of the genetic composition of the Delta epidemic in Russia makes Russia somewhat unusual  although not exceptional  among other countries,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909799
7334,Children  especially girls  are more vulnerable during crises  who need to acquire skills such as social self-efficacy to meet the challenges of the environment  Given that  much progress has been made in e-learning  its capabilities can be used to promote children s health  This study aimed to determine the effect of virtual resilience training on the social self-efficacy of elementary school girls  This experimental study was performed on primary school girls aged 9-10 years in southeastern Iran  Students were selected by convenience sampling and divided into intervention  n   40  and control  n   37  groups by using randomized allocation  The Children s Social Self-Efficacy in Peer Interaction Scale was used for data collection before  immediately  and one month after the intervention  No significant difference was found between the two groups of intervention and control in the score of social self-efficacy before the intervention  However  the score of students in the intervention group improved immediately and one month after the intervention  and a significant difference was observed between the two groups  p    0001   Virtual resilience training has improved the social self-efficacy of elementary school girls and facing challenges is inevitable in today s world  so resilience training seems necessary to prevent social and psychological harm in such children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894781
3027,Background   objectives  Race plays an important role in healthcare disparities  often resulting in worse health outcomes  It is unclear if other patient factors and race interactions may influence mortality in patients with COVID-19  We aimed to evaluate how multiple determinants of all-cause in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 were linked to race  Methods  A retrospective observational study was conducted at two hospitals in metropolitan Detroit  We identified patients aged >  18 years-old who had tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted between March 9 through May 16  2020  Multivariable logistic regression was performed assessing predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality in COVID-19  Results  We identified 1064 unique patients  74  were African Americans  AA   The all-cause in-hospital mortality was 21 7   with the majority of deaths seen in AA  65 4   P   0 002  and patients 80 years or older  52   P < 0 0001   AA women had lower all-cause mortality than AA men  white women  and white men based on race-gender interactions  In multivariable logistic regression analysis  older age  >80-year-old   dementia  and chronic kidney disease were associated with worse all-cause in-hospital mortality  Adjusted for race and body mass index  BMI   the main odds ratios  OR  and 95  confidence intervals  CI  are  Age 80 and older vs < 60 in females  OR   7 4  95  CI  2 9  18 7  in males OR   7 3  95  CI  3 3  16 2  Chronic Kidney Disease  CKD   OR   1 7  95  CI  1 2  2 6  Dementia  OR   2 2  95  CI  1 5  3 3  Conclusion  Gender significantly modified the association of race and COVID-19 mortality  African American females had the lowest all-cause in-hospital mortality risk compared to other gender-race groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957338
3889,Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide  Aging and or metabolic stress directly impact the cardiovascular system  Over the last few years  the contributions of altered nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide  NAD   metabolism to aging and other pathological conditions closely related to cardiovascular diseases have been intensively investigated  NAD  bioavailability decreases with age and cardiometabolic conditions in several mammalian tissues  Compelling data suggest that declining tissue NAD  is commonly related to mitochondrial dysfunction and might be considered as a therapeutic target  Thus  NAD  replenishment by either genetic or natural dietary NAD -increasing strategies has been recently demonstrated to be effective for improving the pathophysiology of cardiac and vascular health in different experimental models  as well as human health  to a lesser extent  Here  we review and discuss recent experimental evidence illustrating that increasing NAD  bioavailability  particularly by the use of natural NAD  precursors  may offer hope for new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943043

8732,In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  simple  rapid  point-of-care tests not requiring trained personnel for primary care testing are essential  Saliva-based antigen rapid tests  ARTs  can fulfil this need  but these tests require overnight-fasted samples  without which independent studies have demonstrated sensitivities of only 11 7 to 23 1   Herein  we report an Amplified Parallel ART  AP-ART  with sensitivity above 90   even with non-fasted samples  The virus was captured multimodally  using both anti-spike protein antibodies and Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2  ACE2  protein  It also featured two parallel flow channels  The first contained spike protein binding gold nanoparticles which produced a visible red line upon encountering the virus  The second contained signal amplifying nanoparticles that complex with the former and amplify the signal without any linker  Compared to existing dual gold amplification techniques  a limit of detection of one order of magnitude lower was achieved  0 0064 ng mL -  1    AP-ART performance in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva of COVID-19 patients was investigated using a case-control study  139 participants enrolled and 162 saliva samples tested   Unlike commercially available ARTs  the sensitivity of AP-ART was maintained even when non-fasting saliva was used  Compared to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing on nasopharyngeal samples  non-fasting saliva tested on AP-ART showed a sensitivity of 97 0   95  CI  84 7-99 8   without amplification  the sensitivity was 72 7   95  CI  83 7-94 8   Thus  AP-ART has the potential to be developed for point-of-care testing  which may be particularly important in resource-limited settings  and for early diagnosis to initiate newly approved therapies to reduce COVID-19 severity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870771

1392,OBJECTIVES  Italy was affected greatly by Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   emerging mainly in the Italian province of Lombardy  This outbreak led to profound governmental interventions along with a strict quarantine  This quarantine may have psychosocial impact on children and parents in particular  The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 8 weeks COVID-19 quarantine on psychosocial functioning of Italian parents and their children  METHODS  In this cross-sectional survey  we included parents and children resided in Italy during the 8 weeks COVID-19 quarantine  We evaluated social and emotional functioning  clinical symptoms possibly related to emotional distress  and change in perspectives using a questionnaire  RESULTS  The majority of 2315 parents  98  mothers  frequently experienced fear of getting ill  92   and fluctuating moods  84    the latter showing correlation to experiencing stress due to being in continuous close vicinity to their children  77   r   0 33   Parents reported a positive effect on the relationship with their partner  79   and their children  89    Irritability in children was frequent  74   and correlated to parental fluctuating moods  r   0 40   The vast majority of the participants  91   reported that their perspectives for the future had changed  CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE  Our findings suggest a profound impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on emotional functioning of parents and their children in Italy  Despite the protective measure of quarantine against national viral spread and subsequent infection  health care professionals should be aware of this emotional impact  in order to develop protective or therapeutic interventions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982331
6449,Lipid nanoparticles  LNPs  have been established as an essential platform for nucleic acid delivery  Efforts have led to the development of vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection using LNPs to deliver messenger RNA  mRNA  coding for the viral spike protein  Out of the four essential components that comprise LNPs  phospholipids represent an underappreciated opportunity for fundamental and translational study  We investigated this avenue by systematically modulating the identity of the phospholipid in LNPs with the goal of identifying specific moieties that directly enhance or hinder delivery efficacy  Results indicate that phospholipid chemistry can enhance mRNA delivery by increasing membrane fusion and enhancing endosomal escape  Phospholipids containing phosphoethanolamine  PE  head groups likely increase endosomal escape due to their fusogenic properties  Additionally  it was found that zwitterionic phospholipids mainly aided liver delivery  whereas negatively charged phospholipids changed the tropism of the LNPs from liver to spleen  These results demonstrate that the choice of phospholipid plays a role intracellularly by enhancing endosomal escape  while also driving organ tropism in vivo  These findings were then applied to Selective Organ Targeting  SORT  LNPs to manipulate and control spleen-specific delivery  Overall  selection of the phospholipid in LNPs provides an important handle to design and optimize LNPs for improved mRNA delivery and more effective therapeutics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904974

7166,Despite the worldwide vaccination  the COVID-19 pandemic continues as SARS-CoV-2 evolves into numerous variants  Since the first identification of the novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern  VOC  Omicron on November 24th  2021  from an immunocompromised patient in South Africa  the variant has overtaken Delta as the predominant lineage in South Africa and has quickly spread to over 40 countries  Here  we provide an initial molecular characterization of the Omicron variant through analyzing a large number of mutations  especially in the spike protein receptor-binding domain with their potential effects on viral infectivity and host immunity  Our analysis indicates that the Omicron variant has two subclades and may evolve from clade 20B instead of the currently dominant Delta variant  In addition  we have also identified mutations that may affect the ACE2 receptor and or antibody bindings  Our study has raised additional questions on the evolution  transmission  virulence  and immune escape properties of this new Omicron variant,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897752
2344,BACKGROUND  Network propagation has been widely used for nearly 20 years to predict gene functions and phenotypes  Despite the popularity of this approach  little attention has been paid to the question of provenance tracing in this context  e g   determining how much any experimental observation in the input contributes to the score of every prediction  RESULTS  We design a network propagation framework with 2 novel components and apply it to predict human proteins that directly or indirectly interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins  First  we trace the provenance of each prediction to its experimentally validated sources  which in our case are human proteins experimentally determined to interact with viral proteins  Second  we design a technique that helps to reduce the manual adjustment of parameters by users  We find that for every top-ranking prediction  the highest contribution to its score arises from a direct neighbor in a human protein-protein interaction network  We further analyze these results to develop functional insights on SARS-CoV-2 that expand on known biology such as the connection between endoplasmic reticulum stress  HSPA5  and anti-clotting agents  CONCLUSIONS  We examine how our provenance-tracing method can be generalized to a broad class of network-based algorithms  We provide a useful resource for the SARS-CoV-2 community that implicates many previously undocumented proteins with putative functional relationships to viral infection  This resource includes potential drugs that can be opportunistically repositioned to target these proteins  We also discuss how our overall framework can be extended to other  newly emerging viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966926
9186,BACKGROUND  Approval of novel vaccines for COVID-19 had brought hope and expectations  but not without additional challenges  One central challenge was understanding how to appropriately prioritize the use of limited supply of vaccines  This study examined the efficacy of the various vaccine prioritization strategies using the vaccination campaign underway in the U S  METHODS  The study developed a granular agent-based simulation model for mimicking community spread of COVID-19 under various social interventions including full and partial closures  isolation and quarantine  use of face mask and contact tracing  and vaccination  The model was populated with parameters of disease natural history  as well as demographic and societal data for an urban community in the U S  with 2 8 million residents  The model tracks daily numbers of infected  hospitalized  and deaths for all census age-groups  The model was calibrated using parameters for viral transmission and level of community circulation of individuals  Published data from the Florida COVID-19 dashboard was used to validate the model  Vaccination strategies were compared using a hypothesis test for pairwise comparisons  RESULTS  Three prioritization strategies were examined  a minor variant of CDC s recommendation  an age-stratified strategy  and a random strategy  The impact of vaccination was also contrasted with a no vaccination scenario  The study showed that the campaign against COVID-19 in the U S  using vaccines developed by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna 1  reduced the cumulative number of infections by 10  and 2  helped the pandemic to subside below a small threshold of 100 daily new reported cases sooner by approximately a month when compared to no vaccination  A comparison of the prioritization strategies showed no significant difference in their impacts on pandemic mitigation  CONCLUSIONS  The vaccines for COVID-19 were developed and approved much quicker than ever before  However  as per our model  the impact of vaccination on reducing cumulative infections was found to be limited  10   as noted above   This limited impact is due to the explosive growth of infections that occurred prior to the start of vaccination  which significantly reduced the susceptible pool of the population for whom infection could be prevented  Hence  vaccination had a limited opportunity to reduce the cumulative number of infections  Another notable observation from our study is that instead of adhering strictly to a sequential prioritizing strategy  focus should perhaps be on distributing the vaccines among all eligible as quickly as possible  after providing for the most vulnerable  As much of the population worldwide is yet to be vaccinated  results from this study should aid public health decision makers in effectively allocating their limited vaccine supplies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865617
4035,The current COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for pathogen detection methods that combine low detection limits with rapid results  Despite the significant progress in methods and devices for nucleic acid amplification  immunochemical methods are still preferred for mass testing without specialized laboratories and highly qualified personnel  The most widely used immunoassays are microplate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  with photometric detection and lateral flow immunoassay  LFIA  with visual results assessment  However  the disadvantage of ELISA is its considerable duration  and that of LFIA is its low sensitivity  In this study  the modified LFIA of a specific antigen of the causative agent of COVID-19  spike receptor-binding domain  was developed and characterized  This modified LFIA includes the use of gold nanoparticles with immobilized antibodies and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid as surface-enhanced Raman scattering  SERS  nanotag and registration of the nanotag binding by SERS spectrometry  To enhance the sensitivity of LFIA-SERS analysis  we determined the optimal compositions of SERS nanotags and membranes used in LFIA  For benchmark comparison  ELISA and conventional colorimetric LFIA were used with the same immune reagents  The proposed method combines a low detection limit of 0 1 ng mL  at 0 4 ng mL for ELISA and 1 ng mL for qualitative LFIA  with a short assay time equal to 20 min  at 3 5 h for ELISA and 15 min for LFIA   The results obtained demonstrate the promise of using the SERS effects in membrane immuno-analytical systems,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940267
88,In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic  digital health tools have been deployed by governments around the world to advance clinical and population health objectives  Few interventions have been successful or have achieved sustainability or scale  In India  government agencies are proposing sweeping changes to India s digital health architecture  Underpinning these initiatives is the assumption that mobile health solutions will find near universal acceptance and uptake  though the observed reticence of clinicians to use electronic health records suggests otherwise  In this practice article  we describe our experience with implementing a digital surveillance tool at a large mass gathering  attended by nearly 30 million people  Deployed with limited resources and in a dynamic chaotic setting  the adherence to human-centered design principles resulted in near universal adoption and high end-user satisfaction  Through this use case  we share generalizable lessons in the importance of contextual relevance  stakeholder participation  customizability  and rapid iteration  while designing digital health tools for individuals or populations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006088

9210,BACKGROUND  Health care workers  HCWs  report frequent adverse skin reactions  ASRs  due to face personal protective equipment  F-PPE  use during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  OBJECTIVES  To describe self-reported ASRs among HCWs using F-PPE  investigate background factors  such as chronic skin diseases and skin types  dry  oily  combination  sensitive   and determine whether HCWs took preventive methods against ASRs  METHODS  An online questionnaire was distributed to 22 993 HCWs at hospitals  RESULTS  The prevalence of ASRs was 61 9  based on 10 287 responders  Different types of F-PPE caused different reactions  The most common ASRs from surgical masks were spots and pimples  37 2   and from FFP3 masks was red and irritated skin  27 3    A significantly higher proportion of HCWs with chronic skin diseases had ASRs  71 6   than those without chronic skin diseases  59 7    P <  001   Some skin types were more prone to ASRs  sensitive skin  78 8   vs dry skin  54 3    P    001   HCWs using F-PPE for >6 hours versus <3 hours per day had a four times higher ASR risk  P   < 001   Nearly all HCWs used preventive and or counteractive methods  94 2    CONCLUSIONS  It is important to consider background factors  such as chronic skin diseases and skin types  to prevent and counteract ASRs due to F-PPE use  HIGHLIGHTS  Daily long-term use of face protective equipment increased the risk of adverse skin reaction by four times  Health care workers  HCWs  with chronic skin diseases had significantly more skin reactions than those without  Sensitive skin types were more prone to skin reactions  The skin reactions were higher in HCWs in intensive care units than HCWs in in-patient clinics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865243
496,SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is known to induce antibodies that recognize also variants of concerns  VoCs  of the virus  However  epidemiological and laboratory evidences indicate that these antibodies have a reduced neutralization ability against VoCs  We studied binding and neutralizing antibodies against the Spike protein domains and subunits of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus and its alpha  beta  delta VoCs and of seasonal betacoronaviruses  HKU1 and OC43  in a cohort of 31 health care workers prospectively followed post-vaccination with BNT162b2-Comirnaty  The study of sequential samples collected up to 64 days post-vaccination showed that serological assays measuring IgG against Wuhan-Hu-1 antigens were a poor proxy for VoC neutralization  In addition  in subjects who had asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 prior to vaccination  the loss of nAbs following disease could be rapid and accompanied by post-vaccination antibody levels similar to those of naive vaccinees  Interestingly  in health care workers naive for SARS-CoV-2 infection  vaccination induced a rapid and transient reactivation of pre-existing seasonal coronaviruses IgG responses that was associated with a subsequent reduced ability to neutralize alpha and beta VoCs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000058
1502,To draw real-world evidence about the comparative effectiveness of multiple time-varying treatment regimens on patient survival  we develop a joint marginal structural proportional hazards model and novel weighting schemes in continuous time to account for time-varying confounding and censoring  Our methods formulate complex longitudinal treatments with multiple   start stop   switches as the recurrent events with discontinuous intervals of treatment eligibility  We derive the weights in continuous time to handle a complex longitudinal dataset on its own terms  without the need to discretize or artificially align the measurement times  We further propose using machine learning models designed for censored survival data with time-varying covariates and the kernel function estimator of the baseline intensity to efficiently estimate the continuous-time weights  Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage probability when analyzing observational longitudinal survival data with irregularly spaced time intervals  compared to conventional methods that require aligned measurement time points  We apply the proposed methods to a large-scale COVID-19 dataset to estimate the causal effects of several COVID-19 treatment strategies on in-hospital mortality or ICU admission  and provide new insights relative to findings from randomized trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981032
5960,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus disease  which initially appeared in Wuhan  China during the month of December 2019  very quickly spread and became a worldwide pandemic  The African continent was not spared  The poor health system and low socioeconomic status in some regions has raised concern on the risk of an epidemic disaster due to the rapid transmission of the virus  This study therefore aims to determine the relationship between the modifications of complete blood count parameters  CRP  and the severity and outcome of SARS-CoV2 infection in the first patients hospitalized at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Libreville  Libreville University Hospital Center  in Gabon  METHODS  This is a prospective study led from April to July 2020 in the COVID infectious department  SICov  of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Libreville  CHUL   RESULTS  In total  184 patients participated in the study  The median age was 47  37 - 54  years  Male subjects predominated  The median number of leucocytes was 5 6  4 4 - 7 45  x 109 L  It was significantly higher in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and in intensive care units  ICU  compared to pauci-symptomatic cases  p < 0 01   Factors associated with death were leukocytosis  crude OR 37 1  8 3 - 98 4  p < 0 01   neutrophilia  OR 20 1  4 6 - 89 0  p < 0 01   NRL >   9  OR 13 5  2 7 - 67 4   p < 0 01  and CRP > 100 mg L  OR 17 8  2 0 - 154 0  p   0 02   CONCLUSIONS  The hematological profile of patients with COVID-19 varies according to the severity of the disease  Leukocytosis  neutrophilia  a NLR above 6 and a CRP higher than 100 mg L were associated with the severity of the infection and death in Gabonese patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910426
6515,The recent prevalence of novel  coronavirus disease 2019  has expanded quickly globally  causing a universal pandemic  Herein  an effort was constructed to design a potent drug to inhibit the main protease of SARS-Cov-2  3CLp  by means of structure-based drug design  A large library of the compounds was used for virtual screening  After molecular docking and ADME studies  we selected a compound with a better binding affinity to the 3CLp active site and acceptable ADME properties compared to the selected positive control drug  Molecular dynamic  MD  simulation  200 ns  and Molecular Mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann Surface Area  MM-PBSA  were used for further analysis  MD simulation outcomes have proved that the 3CLp-ZINC31157475 complex possesses a considerable value of dynamic properties such as flexibility  stability  compactness  and binding energy  Our MM-PBSA computation illustrates that ZINC31157475 is more potent  -88 03 kcal mol -1   than nelfinavir  -19 54 kcal mol -1   against COVID-19 3CLp  Further  we have determined that the main residues of the 3CLp interact with ligands from per-residue binding energy  In conclusion  we suggest that ZINC31157475 can potentially treat COVID-19 by inhibition of the 3CLp  However  in-vitro and in-vivo study is essential for approval of this suggestion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903997
1413,The raging COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented demand for frequent and widespread testing to limit viral transmission  Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  has emerged as a promising diagnostic platform for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2  in part because it can be performed with simple instrumentation  However  isothermal amplification methods frequently yield spurious amplicons even in the absence of a template  Consequently  RT-LAMP assays can produce false positive results when they are based on generic intercalating dyes or pH-sensitive indicators  Here  we report the development of a sensitive RT-LAMP assay that leverages on a novel sequence-specific probe to guard against spurious amplicons  We show that our optimized fluorescent assay  termed LANTERN  takes only 30 min to complete and can be applied directly on swab or saliva samples  Furthermore  utilizing clinical RNA samples from 52 patients with COVID-19 infection and 21 healthy individuals  we demonstrate that our diagnostic test exhibits a specificity and positive predictive value of 95  with a sensitivity of 8 copies per reaction  Hence  our new probe-based RT-LAMP assay can serve as an inexpensive method for point-of-need diagnosis of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981924
8593,Purpose  With the COVID-19 pandemic  more and more articles have been published to explore the role of physical therapy on COVID-19  In order to analyze the research hotspots and the trends of physical therapy and COVID-19  we conducted bibliometric and visual analysis   Methods  Data were collected from the Science Citation Index Expanded  SCI-EXPANDED  and Social Sciences Citation Index  SSCI  of the Web of Science Core Collect  WoSCC  from 2019 to 2021  CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to perform the visual analysis of keywords and references to help quickly get key information   Results  A total of 466 publications were retrieved  Exercise  sedentary behavior  and mental health were research hotspots  The relationship between exercise and immunity  as well as the management of COVID-19 patients after discharge were the research trends   Conclusion  This study provided relevant information for future research  Findings suggested that physical therapy is beneficial for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during isolation  It is hoped that academic exchanges can be quickly established in the face of infectious diseases  And in the future  we should focus on the rehabilitation of discharged patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873371
9938,This study uses structured literature mapping to review worldwide trends in traffic safety following the phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic  Motivated by dissimilar findings globally and a lack of evidence from emerging nations which have been significantly more affected by road traffic crashes  the study examines the impact of the pandemic-induced lockdown on road traffic deaths and injuries in Tamil Nadu  India  Using a holistic approach  methods such as ARIMA  Holt-Winters  Bayesian Structural Time Series  and Generalized Additive Model are employed for counterfactual prediction  to draw a causal inference of lockdown on traffic safety  In line with global studies  a substantial reduction in traffic crashes  injuries  and fatalities during lockdowns has been found  However  the comparison of relative differences shows that the number of grievous injuries reduced more than minor injuries  crashes  or fatalities  Furthermore  these relative differences were sustained even when metrics returned to normalcy in the post-lockdown phases  Further spatial stratification at two levels  cities and districts  shows that the macroscopic state-level trends are also broadly seen in the sub-units  This validates the consistency of trends across rural-urban differences and shows that  despite variations in the degree of enforcement of the lockdown within Chennai city  contrary to expectation  increased police presence did not have a differential impact on road crashes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852726

108,The SARS-CoV-2 virus  which causes the COVID-19 pandemic  has had an unprecedented impact on healthcare requiring multidisciplinary innovation and novel thinking to minimize impact and improve outcomes  Wide-ranging disciplines have collaborated including diverse clinicians  radiology  microbiology  and critical care   who are working increasingly closely with data-science  This has been leveraged through the democratization of data-science with the increasing availability of easy to access open datasets  tutorials  programming languages  and hardware which makes it significantly easier to create mathematical models  To address the COVID-19 pandemic  such data-science has enabled modeling of the impact of the virus on the population and individuals for diagnostic  prognostic  and epidemiological ends  This has led to two large systematic reviews on this topic that have highlighted the two different ways in which this feat has been attempted  one using classical statistics and the other using more novel machine learning techniques  In this review  we debate the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method toward the specific task of predicting COVID-19 outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35005694
6000,OBJECTIVE  The purpose of this study was to inspect return and readmission reasons and rates of discharged patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   METHODS  This is an observational descriptive retrospective study that was conducted with patients who had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosed with severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  polymerase chain reaction  PCR  and hospitalized between April 2020 and June 2021 in a tertiary care university hospital  Patients returning to the hospital after treatment for COVID-19  with symptoms related to COVID-19 within 30 days  were included  Patients under 18 years of age and who were hospitalized in the intensive care unit were excluded  RESULTS  It was determined that of 369 discharged patients  87  23 5   returned to the hospital  9  2 4   were readmitted  and 1  0 02   was deceased within 30 days  The most frequent reasons for returning to the hospital were dyspnea and cough complaints  Existence of pneumonia at first admission  levels of aspartate aminotransferase  lactate dehydrogenase  C-reactive protein  D-dimer  neutrophil counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratios were found to be higher in patients who returned to hospital  compared with the patients who did not return  CONCLUSIONS  Return rate of patients to hospital after discharge with COVID-19 was comparatively high  but readmissions to hospital and mortality rate were low  Comparatively  the higher rate of return to hospital within 30 days of discharge was thought to be resulting from prolonged signs and symptoms related to COVID-19  Since COVID-19 is a new and enigmatic disease and its long-term effects still need to be elucidated  long-term follow-ups of discharged patients will be adequate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909887
4661,Low rates of vaccination  emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2  and increasing transmission relating to seasonal changes leave many U S  communities at risk for surges of COVID-19 during the winter and spring of 2022 that might strain hospital capacity  as in previous waves  The trajectories of COVID-19 hospitalizations during this period are expected to differ across communities depending on their age distributions  vaccination coverage  cumulative incidence  and adoption of risk mitigating behaviors  Yet  existing predictive models of COVID-19 hospitalizations are almost exclusively focused on national- and state-level predictions  This leaves local policymakers in urgent need of tools that can provide early warnings about the possibility that COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise to levels that exceed local capacity  In this work  we develop simple decision rules to predict whether COVID-19 hospitalization will exceed the local hospitalization capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating strategies are implemented during this time  These decision rules use real-time data related to hospital occupancy and new hospitalizations associated with COVID-19  and when available  genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2  We showed that these decision rules present reasonable accuracy  sensitivity  and specificity  all a per thousand yen80   in predicting local surges in hospitalizations under numerous simulated scenarios  which capture substantial uncertainties over the future trajectories of COVID-19 during the winter and spring of 2022  Our proposed decision rules are simple  visual  and straightforward to use in practice by local decision makers without the need to perform numerical computations  Significance Statement  In many U S  communities  the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity during the winter and spring of 2022 remains substantial since COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise due to seasonal changes  low vaccination coverage  and the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2  such as the omicron variant  Here  we provide simple and easy-to-communicate decision rules to predict whether local hospital occupancy is expected to exceed capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating measures are implemented  These decision rules can serve as an alert system for local policymakers to respond proactively to mitigate future surges in the COVID-19 hospitalization and minimize risk of overwhelming local healthcare capacity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931196
2726,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a huge number of deaths from 2020 to 2021  however  effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 are currently under development  Recent studies have demonstrated that green tea polyphenols  particularly EGCG  inhibit coronavirus enzymes as well as coronavirus replication in vitro  Herein  we examined the inhibitory effect of green tea polyphenols on coronavirus replication in a mouse model  We used epigallocatechin gallate  EGCG  and green tea polyphenols containing more than 60  catechin  GTP60  and human coronavirus OC43  HCoV-OC43  as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2  Scanning electron microscopy analysis results showed that HCoV-OC43 infection resulted in virion particle production in infected cells  EGCG and GTP60 treatment reduced coronavirus protein and virus production in the cells  Finally  EGCG- and GTP60-fed mice exhibited reduced levels of coronavirus RNA in mouse lungs  These results demonstrate that green tea polyphenol treatment is effective in decreasing the level of coronavirus in vivo,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960802

347,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   It may cause serious ailments in infected individuals and complications may lead to death  X-rays and Computed Tomography  CT  scans can be used for the diagnosis of the disease  In this context  various methods have been proposed for the detection of COVID-19 from radiological images  In this work  we propose an end-to-end framework consisting of deep feature extraction followed by FS for the detection of COVID-19 from CT scan images  For feature extraction  we utilize three deep learning based Convolutional Neural Networks  CNNs   For FS  we use a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm  Harmony Search  HS   combined with a local search method  Adaptive beta -Hill Climbing  A beta HC  for better performance  We evaluate the proposed approach on the SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan Dataset consisting of 2482 CT scan images and an updated version of the previous dataset containing 2926 CT scan images  For comparison  we use a few state-of-the-art optimization algorithms  The best accuracy scores obtained by the present approach are 97 30  and 98 87  respectively on the said datasets  which are better than many of the algorithms used for comparison  The performances are also at par with some recent works which use the same datasets  The codes for the FS algorithms are available at  https   github com khalid0007 Metaheuristic-Algorithms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002099
8370,Amidst a pandemic  operators of emergency medical service  EMS  systems aim at upholding service at sufficiently low response times while reducing the infection probability of their personnel  Designating ambulances to serve only infected patients and suspected cases may reduce the outage probabilities of ambulances and consequently the response times of the EMS  We investigate the benefits that EMS personnel and patients can gain from such a split  As a solution method to quantify these benefits  we apply a two-stage approach  First  we run a first-stage optimization model to pre-select ambulance splits with the highest emergency call coverage  Second  we solve the approximate Hypercube Queuing Model  AHQM  to evaluate the performance of the pre-selected ambulance splits at the second stage  We contribute to the existing literature by including multiple incident categories and outages of ambulances in the AHQM and combining it with the first-stage optimization model  Further  we conduct a case study for the Coronavirus Disease 2019  Covid-19  pandemic to draw conclusions on the benefits of splitting  We observe that an ambulance split would not reduce the average response time for the examined data set since the Covid-related call volume in Munich and the infection probability are too low  However  a sensitivity analysis shows that long isolation times and high infection probabilities make an ambulance split beneficial for patients and EMS personnel  as an ambulance split reduces the average response time without significantly increasing the mean infection probability for EMS personnel,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876776
7749,OBJECTIVES  Adolescents and young adults  AYAs  face difficulties accessing sexual and reproductive health services  These difficulties were exacerbated for a variety of reasons by the COVID-19 pandemic  We document strategies and outcomes implemented at an urban youth sexual health clinic in Florida that allowed uninterrupted provision of services while protecting against spread of COVID-19  METHODS  The plan-do-study-act  PDSA  model was used to implement COVID-19 interventions designed to allow continued service delivery while protecting the health and safety of staff and patients  This method was applied to clinic operations  community referral systems and community outreach to assess and refine interventions within a quick-paced feedback loop  RESULTS  During the COVID-19 pandemic  changes made via PDSA cycles to clinical navigation services  health communications and youth outreach engagement effectively responded to AYA needs  Although overall numbers of youth served decreased  all youth contacting the clinic for services were able to be accommodated  Case finding rates for chlamydia  gonorrhoea  syphilis and HIV were similar to pre-pandemic levels  CONCLUSIONS  Quality improvement PDSA initiatives at AYA sexual health clinics  particularly those for underserved youth  can be used to adapt service delivery when normal operating models are disrupted  The ability for youth sexual health clinics to adapt to a changing healthcare landscape will be crucial in ensuring that under-resourced youth are able to receive needed services and ambitious Ending the HIV Epidemic goals are achieved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887351
6771,Although lung fibrosis has a major impact in COVID-19 disease  its pathogenesis is incompletely understood  In particular  no direct evidence of pleura implication in COVID-19-related fibrotic damage has been reported so far  In this study  the expression of epithelial cytokeratins and Wilms tumor 1  WT1   specific markers of mesothelial cells  MCs   was analyzed in COVID-19 and unrelated pleura autoptic samples  SARS-CoV-2 replication was analyzed by RT-PCR and confocal microscopy in MeT5A  a pleura MC line  SARS-CoV-2 receptors were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blot  Inflammatory cytokines from the supernatants of SARS-CoV-2-infected MeT5A cells were analysed by Luminex and ELLA assays  Immunohistochemistry of COVID-19 pleura patients highlighted disruption of pleura monolayer and fibrosis of the sub-mesothelial stroma  with the presence of MCs with fibroblastoid morphology in the sub-mesothelial stroma  but no evidence of direct infection in vivo  Interestingly  we found evidence of ACE2 expression in MCs from pleura of COVID-19 patients  In vitro analysis shown that MeT5A cells expressed ACE2  TMPRSS2  ADAM17 and NRP1  plasma membrane receptors implicated in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infectivity  Moreover  MeT5A cells sustained SARS-CoV-2 replication and productive infection  Infected MeT5A cells produced interferons  inflammatory cytokines and metalloproteases  Overall  our data highlight the potential role of pleura MCs as promoters of the fibrotic reaction and regulators of the immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901152
4885,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  VOCs  requires continued development of effective therapeutics  Recently  we identified high-affinity neutralizing nanobodies  Nbs  specific for the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of SARS-CoV-2  Taking advantage of detailed epitope mapping  we generate two biparatopic Nbs  bipNbs  targeting a conserved epitope outside and two different epitopes inside the RBD ACE2 interface  Both bipNbs bind all currently circulating VOCs with high affinities and are capable to neutralize cellular infection with VOC B 1 351  Beta  and B 1 617 2  Delta  in vitro  To assess if the bipNbs NM1267 and NM1268 confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo  human ACE2 transgenic mice are treated intranasally before infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 B 1  B 1 351  Beta  or B 1 617 2  Delta   Nb-treated mice show significantly reduced disease progression and increased survival rates  Histopathological analyses further reveal a drastically reduced viral load and inflammatory response in lungs  These data suggest that both bipNbs are broadly active against a variety of emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and represent easily applicable drug candidates,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927793
6513,COVID-19 pandemic has created a global health challenge  Many pharmaceuticals have been repurposed as potential treatments  though many have not been promising  Due to the inflammatory and destructive effects of the virus on alveolar cells  the effect of exogenous surfactant was assessed as a potential treatment of lung dysfunction in COVID-19 patients  In this pilot study of the clinical trial  49 patients aged 35-80 years with COVID-19 admitted in ICU entered the study  22 patients intubated and 23 had face masks  4 patients in the control arm   The treatment arm patients received two consecutive doses of surfactant  P F ratio  based on serial blood gas analyses before and 12 hours after 2 doses of surfactant  and also  clinical outcomes were assessed in COVID-19 adult patients  surfactant significantly improved pulmonary P F ratio both in intubated and face mask COVID-19 patients  increasing from 119 2   - 51 7 to 179 4   - 115 5   The rate of extubation was much better than similar country-wide studies  Surfactant significantly alleviates the respiratory status in moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS with two consecutive 100 mg doses of surfactant  with 6 hours  interval  though previous studies have been controversial  regarding the effect of surfactant in general forms of ARDS  Higher doses might have better effects  mandating more trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904008

1156,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on health care systems worldwide  which has led to increased mortality of different diseases like myocardial infarction  This is most likely due to three factors  First  an increased workload per nurse ratio  a factor associated with mortality  Second  patients presenting with COVID-19-like symptoms are isolated  which also decreases survival in cases of emergency  And third  patients hesitate to see a doctor or present themselves at a hospital  To assess if this is also true for sepsis patients  we asked whether non-COVID-19 sepsis patients had an increased 30-day mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  This is a post hoc analysis of the SepsisDataNet NRW study  a multicentric  prospective study that includes septic patients fulfilling the SEPSIS-3 criteria  Within this study  we compared the 30-day mortality and disease severity of patients recruited pre-pandemic  recruited from March 2018 until February 2020  with non-COVID-19 septic patients recruited during the pandemic  recruited from March 2020 till December 2020   RESULTS  Comparing septic patients recruited before the pandemic to those recruited during the pandemic  we found an increased raw 30-day mortality in sepsis-patients recruited during the pandemic  33  vs  52   p   0 004   We also found a significant difference in the severity of disease at recruitment  SOFA score pre-pandemic  8  5 - 11  vs  pandemic  10  8 - 13   p < 0 001   When adjusted for this  the 30-day mortality rates were not significantly different between the two groups  52  vs  52  pre-pandemic and pandemic  p   0 798   CONCLUSIONS  This led us to believe that the higher mortality of non-COVID19 sepsis patients during the pandemic might be attributed to a more severe septic disease at the time of recruitment  We note that patients may experience a delayed admission  as indicated by elevated SOFA scores  This could explain the higher mortality during the pandemic and we found no evidence for a diminished quality of care for critically ill sepsis patients in German intensive care units,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986787
1180,BACKGROUND  During Feb-Apr  2020  many countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs   such as school closures and lockdowns  to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus  Overall  these interventions seem to have reduced the spread of the pandemic  We hypothesized that the official and effective start date of NPIs can be noticeably different  e g  due to slow adoption by the population  and that these differences can lead to errors in the estimation of the impact of NPIs  METHODS  SEIR models were fitted to case data from 12 regions to infer the effective start dates of interventions and contrast them with the official dates  The impact of NPIs was estimated from the inferred model parameters  RESULTS  We infer mostly late effective start dates of interventions  For example  Italy implemented a lockdown on Mar 11  but we infer the effective start date on Mar 17   3 05-2 01 days 95  CI   Moreover  we find that the impact of NPIs can be under-estimated if assuming they start at their official date  CONCLUSIONS  Differences between the official and effective start of NPIs are likely  Neglecting such differences can lead to under-estimation of the impact of NPIs  which could cause decision-makers to escalate interventions and guidelines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986406
2697,In the spring of 2020  the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the Covid-19 pandemic  bringing with it drastic changes and challenges for health systems and medical staff  Among the affected were obstetricians and midwives  whose close physical contact with pregnant women  women who recently gave birth  and their children was indispensable  In the obstetric setting  births cannot be postponed  and maternity staff had to adapt to assure obstetric safety while balancing evidence-based standards with the new challenges posed by the pandemic  This scoping review gives a comprehensive overview of the effecs the Covid-19 pandemic had on maternity staff  We followed the evidence-based approach described by Arksey   O Malley  we searched several databases for English and German articles published between January 2020 and January 2021 that discussed or touched upon the effects the pandemic had on maternity staff in OECD countries and China  We found that structural challenges caused by the crisis and its subjective effects on maternity staff fell into two main topic areas  Structural challenges  the first main topic  were divided into five subtopics  staff shortages and restructuring  personal protective equipment and tests  switching to virtual communication  handling women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection  and excluding accompanying persons  The pandemic also strongly affected the staff s mental health  the second main topic   Attempting to meet challenges posed by the pandemic while afraid of contamination  suffering overwork and exhaustion  and struggling to resolve ethical-moral dilemmas had severe negative subjective effects  Several studies indicated increased depression  anxiety  stress levels  and risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms  although the crisis also generated strong occupational solidarity  Care for pregnant  birthing  and breast-feeding women cannot be interrupted  even during a pandemic crisis that requires social distancing  Maternity staff sometimes had to abandon normal standards of obstetric care and were confronted with enormous challenges and structural adjustments that did not leave them unscathed  their mental health suffered considerably  Researchers should study maternity staff s experiences during the pandemic to prepare recommendations that will protect staff during future epidemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961510
9018,Starting with the COVID-19 pandemic  research intensively investigated the effects of school lockdowns on involved stakeholders  such as teachers  students and parents  However  as research projects had to be hurriedly conducted  in-depth and longitudinal studies are lacking  Therefore  the current study uses data from a longitudinal study to investigate the well-being of Austrian in-service teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic  In total 256 teachers took part at both measurement waves and participated in an online survey  Standardized questionnaires were used to assess teachers  perception of emotional experiences and job satisfaction before COVID-19  retrospective  t1   during the first  in situ  t2  and during the second school lockdown  in situ  t3   The results indicated that the vast majority of teachers generally felt a high level of job satisfaction  However  teachers  satisfaction decreased between regular teaching and school lockdowns  Similarly  positive emotional activation was reduced and negative activation increased  Further  results from a positive activation cross-lagged path model indicated that the lack of positive activation led to lower job satisfaction  For negative emotional activation  job satisfaction during the first school lockdown predicted negative activation at the second lockdown,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867585
964,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic  caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has substantially impacted healthcare utilization worldwide  The objective of this retrospective analysis of a large hospital discharge database was to compare all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations during the first six months of the pandemic in the United States with the same months in the previous four years  METHODS  Data were collected from all hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database  PHD  and PHD Special Release reporting hospitalizations from January through July for each year from 2016 through 2020  Hospitalization trends were analyzed stratified by age group  major diagnostic categories  MDCs   and geographic region  RESULTS  The analysis included 286 hospitals from all 9 US Census divisions  The number of all-cause hospitalizations per month was relatively stable from 2016 through 2019 and then fell by 21   57 281 fewer hospitalizations  between March and April 2020  particularly in hospitalizations for non-respiratory illnesses  From April onward there was a rise in the number of monthly hospitalizations per month  Hospitalizations per month  nationally and in each Census division  decreased for 20 of 25 MDCs between March and April 2020  There was also a decrease in hospitalizations per month for all age groups between March and April 2020 with the greatest decreases in hospitalizations observed for patients 50-64 and >  65 years of age  CONCLUSIONS  Rates of hospitalization declined substantially during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic  suggesting delayed routine  elective  and emergency care in the United States  These lapses in care for illnesses not related to COVID-19 may lead to increases in morbidity and mortality for other conditions  Thus  in the current stage of the pandemic  clinicians and public-health officials should work  not only to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission  but also to ensure that care for non-COVID-19 conditions is not delayed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34990489
