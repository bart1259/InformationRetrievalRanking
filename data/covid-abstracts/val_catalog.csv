3501,After the outburst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  a worldwide research effort has led to the uncovering of many aspects of the COVID-19  among which we can count the outstanding role played by inflammatory cytokine milieu in the disease progression  Despite that  molecular mechanisms that regulate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are still almost unidentified  In this study  we investigated whether the pro-inflammatory milieu of the host affects the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression  Our results indicated that the host inflammatory milieu favors SARS-CoV-2 infection by directly increasing TMPRSS2 expression  We unveiled the molecular mechanism that regulates this process and that can be therapeutically advantageously targeted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950146
8664,The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a rapid transformation in healthcare delivery  Ambulatory care abruptly shifted from in-person to telehealth visits with providers using digital video and audio tools to reach patients at home  Advantages to telehealth care include enhanced patient convenience and provider efficiencies  but financial  geographic  privacy  and access barriers to telehealth also exist  These are disproportionately greater for older adults and for those in rural areas  low-income communities  and communities of color  threatening to worsen preexisting disparities in tobacco use and health  Pandemic-associated regulatory changes regarding privacy and billing allowed many Cancer Center Cessation Initiative  C3I  programs in NCI-designated Cancer Centers to start or expand video-based telehealth care  Using 3 C3I programs as examples  we describe the methods used to shift to telehealth delivery  Although telephone-delivered treatment was already a core tobacco treatment modality with a robust evidence base  little research has yet compared the effectiveness of tobacco cessation treatment delivery by video versus phone or in-person modalities  Video-delivery has shown greater medication adherence  higher patient satisfaction  and better retention in care than phone-based delivery  and may improve cessation outcomes  We outline key questions for further investigation to advance telehealth for tobacco cessation treatment in cancer care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872049

5477,Background  The pandemic caused by COVID-19 is one of the main problems of public health around the world  Of the individuals with infection  a large amount corresponds to first-level health workers  Objective  To determine the relationship between length of stay in respiratory offices and SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers at a first-level health center  Material and methods  Cross-sectional analytic study in health workers of a first-level unit of San Luis Potosi  Mexico  who developed suspected symptomatology of SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 2020 to January 2021  Two groups were formed according to the result of the RT-PCR  Demographic variables  occupation  work area  work in respiratory area  hours of work accumulated within the respiratory area to develop symptomatology  and date of development of symptomatology were registered  Results  Of 350 health workers active  144 developed respiratory symptomatology  of these  66 had positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection  Working in an area with no respiratory patients but in contact with other patients confers an OR 2 49  1 04-6 26   when compared with working in a respiratory area  p 0 0446  The length in a filter for respiratory patients gives a protective OR of 0 3062  0 08-0 99  for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection  p 0 0608  Each hour accumulated in a respiratory area confers an OR 1 001  0 99-1 00  without statistical significance  p 0 3046  Conclusions  Working in a respiratory area and the accumulated hours of work in this place are not risk factors for developing COVID-19 in health workers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918890
8858,Background  Thrombosis is a characteristic complication in coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Since coagulopathy has been observed over the entire clinical course  thrombosis might be a clue to understanding the specific pathology in COVID-19  Currently  there is limited epidemiological data of COVID-19-associated thrombosis in the Japanese population and none regarding variant strains of SARS-CoV-2  Here  we elucidate the risk factors and the pattern of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients  Methods  The patients consecutively admitted to Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed  SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern interest  VOC VOI  carrying the spike protein mutants E484K  N501Y  or L452R were identified by PCR-based analysis  All thrombotic events were diagnosed by clinical symptoms  ultrasonography  and or radiological tests  Results  Among the 516 patients  32 patients experienced 42 thromboembolic events  Advanced age  severe respiratory conditions  and several abnormal laboratory markers were associated with the development of thrombosis  While thrombotic events occurred in 13  of the patients with a severe respiratory condition  those events still occurred in 2 5  of the patients who did not require oxygen therapy  Elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels on admission were independent risk factors of thrombosis  adjusted odds ratio 9 39 and 3 11  95  confidence interval 2 08-42 3  and 1 06-9 17  respectively   Of the thrombotic events  22 were venous  whereas 20 were arterial  While patients with thrombosis received anticoagulation and antiinflammatory therapies with a higher proportion  the mortality rate  organ dysfunctions  and bleeding complications in these patients were higher than those without thrombosis  The incidence of thrombosis in COVID-19 became less frequent over time  such as during the replacement of the earlier strains of SARS-CoV-2 by VOC VOI and during increased use of anticoagulatory therapeutics  Conclusion  This study elucidated that elevated D-dimer and ferritin levels are useful biomarkers of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients  The comparable incidence of arterial thrombosis with venous thrombosis and the development of thrombosis in less severe patients required further considerations for the management of Japanese patients with COVID-19  Further studies would be required to identify high-risk populations and establish appropriate interventions for thrombotic complications in COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869681
427,OBJECTIVE  The aim of this study was to evaluate patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and were consulted by neurology during their hospital stay  METHODS  All files of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital between March 11th and December 31st  2020 were retrospectively reviewed  and files of patients who consulted by neurology during their stay were included  Demographic and clinical characteristics  neurologic diagnosis  outcome and related laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed  Patients were categorized into the first wave and second wave according to the date of hospitalization  RESULTS  A total of 2257 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19  among them  127 were consulted by a neurologist during their hospital stay  Fifteen patients received a consultation for possible drug interactions  Among the remaining 112 patients  the reason for neurology consultation was i  exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity vs ii  new-onset neurological manifestations  The median age was 68 5   - 14 2 years  and 60 7  were men  Dementia and stroke were the leading neurological comorbidities  COVID-19 disease was more severe in the patients with the new-onset neurological comorbidity than in patients with exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity  p   0 07   Serum creatinine kinase levels were higher in the new-onset patient group  p < 0 05   Exacerbation of previous neurological disease or new neurological impairment were jointly and severely related to high mortality  overall 35 112 vs 275 2145  p < 0 001  exacerbation 12 45 vs 275 2145 p < 0 01  new-onset 23 67 vs 275 2145  p < 0 001   CONCLUSION  Serious neurological involvement is relatively uncommon in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and is associated with increased mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001325
3698,1  Background  The present study measures the fear of COVID-19 among hospital healthcare workers and identifies several factors associated with increasing fear of COVID-19   2  Methods  A cross-sectional  hospital-based survey was conducted on healthcare workforce recruited from the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases from 1 October 2021 and 20 October 2021  We selected the participants who have been directly involved in diagnosing  treating  or providing nursing care to patients with COVID-19  The primary data was collected via sending the invitation directly to the participants  utilizing structured self-completed questionnaires  The seven-item fear of COVID-19 scale was used to measure the data  The responses of 208 hospital healthcare workers were included in the final analysis   3  Results  Total score of COVID-19 fear was 19 62  SD   5 22   The COVID-19 fear score of 7 items ranged from 2 38  SD   0 83  to 3 21  SD   0 96   The lowest and highest scores were the item  My hands become clammy when I think about Corona  and the item  I am most afraid of corona  was the highest  respectively  Linear regression of the COVID-19 fear showed that the factors positively correlated with the fear of COVID-19 among hospital healthcare workers were  being influenced by the community  p   0 001   feeling at very high risk of COVID-19  p   0 03   and experiencing traumatic stress with an academic event  p   0 042    4  Conclusions  Although these findings merit further elaboration  these preliminary findings suggest relatively great fear of the COVID-19 pandemic among Vietnamese hospital healthcare workers and that social and personal connections are necessary for maintaining the mental wellbeing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946439
835,Background  The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a variety of stressors  Preliminary research has demonstrated that general public are experiencing a range of psychological problems  including stress-related disturbances  However  to date  there is not much research on the prevalence of adjustment disorder during the current pandemic  Objectives  This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder compared to posttraumatic symptoms  depression and generalized anxiety in a large sample of adult Poles  in the first phase of the current pandemic  Method  Self-report data from a web-based sample  N   1 742  was collected between March 25 and April 27  just after the introduction of nationwide quarantine measures in Poland  Results  The current COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful event for 75  of participants and the strongest predictor of adjustment disorder  Increased symptoms of adjustment disorder were reported by 49   and they were associated with female gender and not having a full-time job  However  after exclusion of co-occurring symptomatology  14  of the sample were finally qualified as meeting diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder  A substantial proportion of the sample screened also positive for generalized anxiety  44   and depression  26    the rate for presumptive PTSD diagnosis was 2 4   Conclusions  High rates of negative mental health outcomes were found in the Polish population in the first weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures  They indicate the intense current stress-related symptoms in the early phase of the pandemic and warrant further monitoring on population s mental health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992743
19,BACKGROUND  Intimate partner violence  IPV  affects one in three women and has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic  Although most injuries are to the head  face  and neck  the intersection of IPV and traumatic brain injury  TBI  remains largely unrecognized  This paper reports on COVID-19-related impacts  barriers  needs  and priorities to healthcare and support services for women survivors of IPV-TBI  METHODS  Using a participatory research model  we engaged 30 stakeholders in virtual meetings drawn from an IPV-TBI Knowledge to Practice  K2P  Network including women survivors  service providers  researchers  and decision makers  Data was gathered through small group breakout sessions facilitated by the research team using semi-structured discussion guides  Sessions were recorded  transcribed verbatim transcripts  and analysed using thematic analysis techniques  Stakeholders were given the opportunity to contribute to the analysis and knowledge transfer through member checking activities  Ethics approval was obtained through the University of Toronto  RESULTS  COVID-19 has increased rates and severity of IPV and barriers to services and help-seeking  These effects are exacerbated by infrastructure difficulties in rural and remote areas  including limited access to services  Implications of virtual care such as safety  privacy  and usability require careful consideration  Requests from survivors for peer support have increased significantly  indicating more formalized and better-supported peer roles are needed  An overwhelming lack of awareness of the intersection of IPV-TBI continues  Increasing education and awareness among healthcare and IPV service providers  survivors  and the public remains a priority  CONCLUSIONS  The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified IPV-TBI  increased challenges for women survivors  and accentuated the continued lack of IPV-TBI awareness  Key recommendations for healthcare and rehabilitation to address this priority are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007550
8187,BACKGROUND  To prevent the spread of coronavirus disease  COVID-19   it is important to avoid 3Cs  closed spaces  crowded places  and close-contact settings   However  the risk of contact with an unspecified number of people is inevitable while commuting to and from work  In this study  we investigated the relationship between commuting  and the risk of COVID-19 and COVID-19-induced anxiety  METHODS  An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain a dataset from 27 036 respondents  One-way commuting time was evaluated using a five-case method  The commuting distance was estimated using zip codes of the home and workplace  Logistic regression analysis was performed with the following outcomes  COVID-19 risk  close contact  infection anxiety  and infection anxiety due to commuting  Commuting distance and commuting time were analyzed separately in the model  We excluded participants with incalculable commuting distance  commuting distance exceeding 300 km  commuting distance of 0 km  or who telecommuted at least once a week  RESULTS  The total number of participants included in the analysis was 14 038  The adjusted odds ratios  aORs  of using public transportation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were 4 17  95  confidence interval  CI   2 51-6 93   commuting time  and 5 18  95  CI  3 06-8 78   commuting distance   The aOR of COVID-19 diagnosis decreased significantly with increasing commuting distance  The aORs of using public transportation to infection anxiety were 1 44  95  CI  1 31-1 59   commuting time  and 1 45  95  CI  1 32-1 60   commuting distance   The longer the commuting time  the more the aOR increased  CONCLUSIONS  COVID-19 risk  close contact  and infection anxiety were all associated with the use of public transportation during commuting  Both commuting distance and time were associated with infection anxiety due to commuting  and the strength of the association increased with increase in commuting time distance  Since transportation by commuting is associated with COVID-19 risk and anxiety  we recommend the use of telecommuting and other means of work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879866
1565,In 2020  a novel emerging infectious disease - COVID-19 - became a global pandemic and prompted unprecedented social distancing measures  We examined the associations of voluntary stay-at-home  SAH  orders during the COVID-19 pandemic with vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions  e g  social distancing  hand washing   A quasi-experimental study using an online adult sample was conducted in U S  states with and without voluntary SAH orders during the COVID-19 pandemic  Self-report surveys assessed vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions  Participants living in states with SAH orders showed inflated vulnerability assessments for contracting COVID-19  and this association was stronger for affect-laden than cognitively-based assessments  Moreover  only affect-laden vulnerability assessments were uniquely associated with precautionary intentions and accounted for the relationship between SAH orders and precautionary intentions  Our study was among the first to explore the impact of voluntary SAH orders on vulnerability assessments and precautionary intentions  Results are discussed in terms of their implications for health behavioral models and applications for promoting self-protective actions during a pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979833
6392,A cross-sectional field survey was conducted from November 2020 to January 2021 among 7259 participants to investigate the public perception  willingness  and information sources for COVID-19 vaccination  with the focus on the elderly and non-communicable chronic disease  NCD  population  Multiple logistic regressions were performed to identify associated factors of the vaccination willingness  The willingness rate of the elderly to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine  79 08   was lower than that of the adults aged 18-59  84 75    The multiple analysis didn t identify significant relationship between NCD status and the vaccination intention  The main reasons for vaccine hesitancy by the public were  concern for vaccine safety  low infection risk  waiting and seeing others getting vaccinated  concern of vaccine effectiveness and price  Their relative importance differed between adults aged 18-59 and the elderly  and between adults aged 18-59 with or without NCD  Perception for vaccination importance  vaccine confidence  and trust in health workers were significant predictors of the vaccination intention in both age groups  The elderly who perceived high infection risk or had trust in governments were more likely to accept the vaccine  Compared with the adults aged 18-59  the elderly used fewer sources for COVID-19 vaccination information and more trusted in traditional media and family  relatives  and friends for getting vaccination recommendations  To promote vaccine uptake  the vaccination campaigns require comprehensive interventions to improve vaccination attitude  vaccine accessibility and affordability  and tailor strategies to address specific concerns among different population groups and conducted via their trusted sources  especially for the elderly,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906026
7077,During the 2020 COVID-19 wave  the Australian Government made an additional  550 Coronavirus Supplement available for people receiving social security payments  and temporarily suspended mutual obligation requirements  By doing so  the government effectively gave people who had been long stigmatised and subject to punitive conditionality to compel them into the labour market  financial security and their time back  Drawing on survey responses from people who received the  550 Supplement and had their mutual obligation activities suspended or reduced  this research examines how people used their time during this period and whether it differed from pre-pandemic government policy  We find that the increase in payments through the Supplement and the suspension of mutual obligations impacted positively on people s lives including the  1  the ability of respondents to meet basic needs and improve their long-term financial security   2  improvements to physical and emotional well-being   3  increased labour market engagement and  4  engagement in other forms of unpaid productive work,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898752
3941,The Government of Pakistan has established Adult Vaccination Counters  AVCs  to immunize general population with COVID-19 vaccine  Different brands of COVID-19 vaccines have different protocols  It is important that the knowledge and skills of the vaccination staff at AVCs should be accurate  To assess this  a cross-sectional study was conducted in all 15 AVCs at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa s provincial capital in May 2021  using the simulated client approach  Structured open-ended and simulated scenario-based questions were used to collect data from the vaccination staff of AVCs  This study showed that 53 3  of the AVCs had at most three out of four brands of COVID-19 vaccines  60  of the AVCs did not have the mechanism to track client s vaccine first dose  date  and brand  Only 66 7  of the AVCs had a complete knowledge of all the available vaccines  86 7  and 80  of the AVCs knew the correct duration and administration of the same brand of COVID-19 vaccine s second dose respectively  At the client s end  6 7  were aware about the brand of administered COVID-19 vaccine  46 7  were advised about the date of the second shot of vaccination  Only 13 3  of the clients were informed about the procedure of getting an official vaccination certificate  It was concluded that the knowledge and skill of the vaccination staff at AVCs is inadequate  Every vaccine has a different protocol in terms of number of doses and duration  AVCs must have a tracking system to inoculate the second dose with the same brand as the first dose  There is a need for rigorous monitoring and training of the COVID-19 vaccination staff on various protocols of vaccine to prevent losing public s trust,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941905
6994,In March 2020  the UK was placed in lockdown following the spread of the Covid-19 virus  Just as legitimate workplaces made changes to enable their employees to work from home  the illicit drugs trade also made alternative arrangements  adapting its supply models to ensure continuity of operations  Based upon qualitative interviews with 46 practitioners  this paper assesses how front-line professionals have experienced and perceived the impact of Covid-19 on child criminal exploitation and County Lines drug supply in the UK  Throughout the paper  we highlight perceived adaptations to the County Lines supply model  the impact of lockdown restrictions on detection and law enforcement activities aimed at County Lines  and on efforts to safeguard children and young people from criminal exploitation  Our participants generally believed that the pandemic had induced shifts to County Lines that reflected an ongoing evolution of the drug supply model and changes in understanding or attention because of Covid-19 restrictions  rather than a complete reconstitution of the model itself  Practitioners perceived that Covid-19 has had  and continues to have  a significant impact on some young people s vulnerability to exploitation  on the way in which police and frontline practitioners respond to County Lines and child criminal exploitation  and on the way illegal drugs are being moved and sold,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898976
7632,BACKGROUND  Lockdowns and physical distancing have dramatically limited the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and other common communicable infections  However  little is known about their impact on head lice and scabies  AIM  To assess the impact of the 2020 French National lockdowns  17 March-11 May 2020  and 30 October-15 December 2020  and physical distancing recommendations  from February 2020  on the dynamics of head lice and scabies infestations  METHODS  The weekly sales of topical head lice treatments  topical scabies treatments and oral ivermectin were extracted from the database of the healthcare science company IQVIA  60  of all French retail pharmacies  and analysed over a 5-year period  March 2016-December 2020   A periodic regression model was fitted to drug sales before the COVID-19 period  2016-2019  and extrapolated to compare the observed sales in 2020 to the expected sales  RESULTS  A decrease of the sales of tracer topical treatments for head lice and scabies was observed from March 2020  synchronously with the first French national lockdown  For the period March-December 2020  the mean reduction in observed vs  expected sales for head lice and scabies topical treatments was 44  and 14   respectively  By contrast  although there was an observed decrease in oral ivermectin sales after March 2020  it was much lower  4    probably because of studies reporting the potential positive effects of this drug on COVID-19 infection  CONCLUSION  COVID-19 lockdown and physical distancing reduce circulation of head lice and scabies in France  Further studies are needed to assess the long-term impact of these social behaviour changes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888912

7420,BACKGROUND  Since the outbreak started in 2019  COVID-19 pandemic has a significant global impact  Due to the highly infective nature of SARS-CoV-2  the COVID-19 close contacts are at significant risk of contracting COVID-19  China s experience in successfully controlling COVID-19 emphasized the importance of managing close contacts because this strategy helps to limit potential infection sources  prevent the unconscious spread of COVID-19 and thus control this pandemic  As a result  to understand and consider the management of close contacts may be beneficial to other countries  However  managing close contacts is challenging owing to the huge number of close contacts and a lack of appropriate management tools and literature references  METHODS  A new system called the COVID-19 Close Contact Information Management System was developed  Here we introduced the design  use  improvement and achievements of this system  RESULTS  This system was designed from the standpoint of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in charge of managing close contacts  Two main functions and eight modules themes were ultimately formed after two development stages  The system introduces what information need to be collected in the close contact management  Since the system allows information flow across cities  the geographical distance and administrative regional boundaries are no longer obstacles for managing close contacts  which promotes the management of each close contact  Moreover  when this system is used in conjunction with other data tools  it provides data assistance for understanding the COVID-19 characteristics and formulating targeted COVID-19 control policies  To date  the system has been widely used in Guangdong Province for over 1 year and has recorded tens of thousands of pieces of data  There is sufficient practical experience to suggest that the system is capable of meeting the professional work requirements for close contact management  CONCLUSIONS  This system provides a new way to manage close contacts and restrict the spread of COVID-19 by combining information technology with disease prevention and control strategies in the realm of public health  We hope that this system will serve as an example and guide for those anticipating similar work in other countries in response to current and future public health incidents,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893052
1945,INTRODUCTION  The coronavirus disease of 2019  COVID-19  pandemic catalyzed an unprecedented redesign and innovative overhaul of health care delivery thrusting from fringe to mainstream virtual care  With a return to conventional practice  we now must create a research and policy agenda using the changes wrought by COVID-19 to help create a better health care system in its aftermath  The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction of otolaryngology outpatient visits during the pandemic  METHODS  A prospective survey study was performed on caregivers of all patients ages 0-26 years old seen in the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at our large tertiary care children s hospital from February-April 2020  The three study groups were those seen in-person 6 weeks before telemedicine was implemented  IBTM   those seen in telemedicine during the first 6 weeks  TM  it was implemented at our hospital  and those seen in-person during the telemedicine period  IDTM  in the same timeframe  The survey consisted of satisfaction questions related to their visit  if their child was recommended surgery at the time of the visit  and if the caregiver agreed with the recommendation  A medical record review was also performed  RESULTS  A total of 176 caregivers completed the survey with 113 64 2   completing the survey for an IBTM appointment  59 33 5   for a TM appointment  and 4 2 3   for an IDTM appointment  There were 100 56 8   male patients and 167 94 9   were white  Families gave a higher response for the statement  The ability to communicate with the physician   p    012  and  The overall outpatient experience   p    004  in the IBTM cohort compared to the TM group  There were no significant differences for the other statements regarding the ability to understand recommendations  courtesy  and knowledge of the physician  Regardless of group  98 6  of caregivers agreed with surgical recommendation when surgery was recommended  However  when surgery was not recommended at the appointment  caregivers were 11x more likely to disagree with the surgical recommendations  OR 11 49 95 CI 1 44-91 38 p    005  CONCLUSION  We conclude that telemedicine was equally well received by patients as compared to traditional live assessments suggesting that virtual care is a viable post-pandemic paradigm change  Satisfaction was rated as  Good  or  Excellent   however  messaging when surgery is not recommended was less acceptable and must be improved to obtain increased caregivers  agreement in an era of shared decision making,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974276
6584,BACKGROUND  Healthcare workers  HCWs  not adhering to physical distancing recommendations is a risk factor for acquisition of severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The study objective was to assess the impact of interventions to improve HCW physical distancing on actual distance between HCWs in a real-life setting  METHODS  HCWs voluntarily wore proximity beacons to measure the number and intensity of physical distancing interactions between each other in a pediatric intensive care unit  We compared interactions before and after implementing a bundle of interventions including changes to the layout of workstations  cognitive aids  and individual feedback from wearable proximity beacons  RESULTS  Overall  we recorded 10 788 interactions within 6 feet   approximately 2 m  and lasting >5 seconds  The number of HCWs wearing beacons fluctuated daily and increased over the study period  On average  13 beacons were worn daily  32  of possible staff  range  2-32 per day   We recorded 3 218 interactions before the interventions and 7 570 interactions after the interventions began  Using regression analysis accounting for the maximum number of potential interactions if all staff had worn beacons on a given day  there was a 1  decline in the number of interactions per possible interactions in the postintervention period  incident rate ratio  0 99  95  confidence interval  0 98-1 00  P    02  with fewer interactions occurring at nursing stations  in workrooms and during morning rounds  CONCLUSIONS  Using quantitative data from wearable proximity beacons  we found an overall small decline in interactions within 6 feet between HCWs in a busy intensive care unit after a multifaceted bundle of interventions was implemented to improve physical distancing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903308
6176,Recent studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic will induce drastic changes in the business models of the insurance industry  However  despite an abundance of predictions  the literature still lacks empirical investigations of the impact of the pandemic  In this paper  we perform a first of a kind analysis and investigate the short-run impact of COVID-19 on the activity in the insurance in one country-North Macedonia  By utilizing a seasonal autoregressive model  we find that during the first half of 2020  the activity in the insurance industry shrank by more than 10  to what was expected  The total loss in the industry amounted to approximately 8 2 million euros  This was much less than the volume of reserves that the Insurance Supervision Agency made available as funds for dealing with the potential crisis  In addition  the pandemic induced changes in the insurance activity structure-the share of motor vehicles class in the total industry activity fell at the expense of the property classes  Our results suggest that the insurance industry in North Macedonia was well prepared to tackle the consequences of the pandemic and that automatic stabilizers had a major influence on weakening the overall negative impact,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908828

5521,Cardiac injury is a common complication of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   but the exact mechanisms have not been completely elucidated  The virus receptors on subsets of cells are key determinants of susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  Due to its high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV  SARS-CoV-2 also utilizes ACE2 as the cell entry receptor  A growing number of studies have indicated that other receptors apart from ACE2 are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection  This study aimed to elucidate the expression characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptors in the heart  We first investigated ACE2 expression in a comprehensive transcriptional landscape of the human heart comprising single-nucleus RNA-seq  snRNA-seq  data for >280 000 cells  Then  the expression distributions of novel SARS-CoV-2 receptors were analyzed at the single-cell level to clarify the cardiovascular complications in COVID-19  We observed a higher percentage of ACE2-positive cells in pericytes  8 3    fibroblasts  5 1    and adipocytes  4 4   in the human heart  compared to other cell types  The frequency of ACE2-positive cells in each cell type from the ventricles was significantly higher than that in the atria  suggesting that the ventricular cells are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection  The distribution patterns of other receptors  BSG  HSPA5  KREMEN1  NRP1  ANPEP  AXL  were significantly different from those of ACE2  demonstrating higher expression levels in ventricular cardiomyocytes  Moreover  our results suggest that fibroblasts and adipocytes  aside from pericytes  may be vulnerable targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human heart  Our study presents potential targets for future clinical studies and interventions for cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917662
4192,The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges and implications for the sports community  Thus  this study aimed to describe the prevalence of COVID-19 in Brazilian athletes and identify the epidemiological  clinical  athletic  life and health factors associated with the disease in these individuals  A cross-sectional study was performed involving 414 athletes from 22 different sports using an online questionnaire from August to November 2020  The association between the athletes  characteristics and COVID-19 was evaluated using a logistic regression model  The prevalence of COVID-19 was 8 5   although only 40  of athletes reported having been tested  Being under 27 years of age  3-fold   having children   5-fold   having a teammate test positive for COVID-19  2 5-fold   and smoking  14-fold  were associated with a possible higher risk of disease  Almost 20  of athletes self-reported musculoskeletal injuries during the period of the pandemic that was studied  Athletes with a university education  P   0 02   a profession other than sports  P < 0 001   those from a low-income family  P   0 01   and public health system users  P   0 04  were significantly less frequently tested for COVID-19  whereas international competitors  athletes who received a wage  and athletes who had a teammate who tested positive for COVID-19 were 2-  3-  and 15-fold more likely to be tested for COVID-19  respectively  Approximately 26  of the athletes who tested negative or were untested reported more than three characteristic COVID-19 symptoms  and 11  of athletes who tested positive for COVID-19 were asymptomatic  The identification of modifiable  have children  smoking  and teammates positively tested  and non-modifiable  age under 27 years  factors related to COVID-19 in athletes can contribute to implementing surveillance programmes to decrease the incidence of COVID-19 in athletes and its negative impacts in sports,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937981
2910,We used epidemiologic and viral genetic information to identify a case of likely reinfection in an otherwise healthy  young Marine recruit enrolled in the prospective  longitudinal COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines  CHARM  study  and we paired these findings with serological studies  This participant had a positive RT-PCR to SARS-CoV-2 upon routine sampling on study day 7  although he was asymptomatic at that time  He cleared the infection within seven days  On study day 46  he had developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 again  Viral whole genome sequencing was conducted from nares swabs at multiple time points  The day 7 sample was determined to be lineage B 1 340  whereas both the day 46 and day 49 samples were B 1 1  The first positive result for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM serology was collected on day 49 and for IgG on day 91  This case appears most consistent with a reinfection event  Our investigation into this case is unique in that we compared sequence data from more than just paired specimens  and we also assayed for immune response after both the initial infection and the later reinfection  These data demonstrate that individuals who have experienced an infection with SARS-CoV-2 may fail to generate effective or long-lasting immunity  similar to endemic human beta coronaviruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959544
3014,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has generated many challenges for physicians  including multiple long-term effects that are still being studied  We report a CASE of patient who developed a retropharyngeal abscess post-COVID19 infection  We report a CASE of a female who was diagnosed with COVID19 pneumonia and hospitalized for a week at an outside institute  Approximately 3 weeks post discharge she developed neck pain  dysphagia  voice change and odynophagia for which she went to an outside emergency department  A soft tissue neck CT was performed and was concerning for retropharyngeal abscess  The patient was then transferred to our institution  On arrival  a CT scan of the neck and nasopharyngoscopy were performed and biopsies of the epiglottis and right inferior tonsillar pole were taken  Biopsies of the epiglottis and tonsil showed acute inflammation  spongiosis  edema and marked dilation of the lymphatics  Her clinical course was complicated by persistent infection requiring multiple washouts  hyperglycemia  tube feed intolerance  dysphagia and deconditioning  A multi-disciplinary approach was instituted for appropriate management  This case report highlights the necessity for close follow up after recovery from COVID-19 infection  particularly in patients with multiple comorbidities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957361
1443,The present study focuses on the indiscriminate disposal of personal protective equipment  PPEs  and resulting environmental contamination during the 3rd wave of COVID-19-driven global pandemic in the Chittagong metropolitan area  Bangladesh  Because of the very high rate of infection by the delta variant of this virus  the use of PPEs by the public is increased significantly to protect the ingestion inhalation of respiratory droplets in the air  However  it is a matter of solicitude that general people throw away the PPEs to the dwelling environment unconsciously  With the increase of inappropriate disposal of PPEs  i e   mostly the disposable face masks made from plastic microfibers   the possibility of transmission of the virus to the general public cannot be neglected completely  This is because this virus can survive for several days on the inanimate matter like plastics and fibers  At the same time  the result of environmental contamination by microplastic microfiber has been widespread which eventually creates the worst impact on ecosystems and organisms  The present results may help to increase public perception of the use and subsequent disposal of PPEs  especially the face masks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981371
7382,Patients with primary antibody deficiency are at risk for severe and in many cases for prolonged COVID-19  Convalescent plasma treatment of immunocompromised individuals could be an option especially in countries with limited access to monoclonal antibody therapies  While studies in immunocompetent COVID19 patients have demonstrated only a limited benefit  evidence for the safety  timing  and effectiveness of this treatment in antibody-deficient patients is lacking  Here  we describe 16 cases with primary antibody deficiency treated with convalescent plasma in four medical centers  In our cohort  treatment was associated with a reduction in viral load and improvement of clinical symptoms  even when applied over a week after onset of infection  There were no relevant side effects besides a short-term fever reaction in one patient  Longitudinal full-genome sequencing revealed the emergence of mutations in the viral genome  potentially conferring an antibody escape in one patient with persistent viral RNA shedding upon plasma treatment  However  he resolved the infection after a second course of plasma treatment  Thus  our data suggest a therapeutic benefit of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with primary antibody deficiency even months after infection  While it appears to be safe  PCR follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 is advisable and early re-treatment might be considered in patients with persistent viral shedding,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893946
4704,The ongoing coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic and attendant lockdown mandates may have detrimental effects on body image outcomes  which in turn highlights the importance of identifying protective factors  Here  we examined associations between COVID-19-related stress and body image disturbance  as well as the potential mediating and moderating role of self-compassion  During the third lockdown in the United Kingdom  we asked an online sample of adults  N 600  to complete measures of COVID-19-related stress  body image disturbance  and self-compassion  Mediation analysis showed that higher COVID-19-related stress was significantly associated with greater body image disturbance  and that this relationship was mediated by self-compassion  In contrast  self-compassion did not significantly moderate the effects of stress on body image disturbance  These results suggest that promoting greater self-compassion may be a viable means of mitigating adverse outcomes from the COVID-19 pandemic on body image disturbance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931100

914,Women living in underserved communities are at an increased risk for substance use disorders and other comorbid health issues  a public health concern that was exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold  In response to the challenges the pandemic presented  services delivered by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women  Infants  and Children  WIC  adapted nimbly  including WIC nutrition managers  and counselors  efforts to provide reactive referrals of clients raising concern about substance misuse and related consequences  This adaptation signaled an opportunity to consider integrating more proactive  evidence-based strategies for substance use disorders such as standardized brief assessments  advice  and referral procedures  i e   Screening  Brief Interventions  and Referral to Treatment  SBIRT    as part of routine WIC operations  Integration of such routine practice would improve the quality of care WIC provides to their clients and families  while addressing a major gap in public health by connecting clients at high risk for substance use disorders and substance-related problems to much needed services  Given the adaptability of WIC to reactively manage the wide array of psychosocial and mental health problems that increased during the pandemic  opportunities exist for future research to examine the feasibility  acceptability  and efficacy of proactive implementation of brief screening  advice  and treatment referral to reduce substance-related harm among women living in underserved communities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34991384
5641,BACKGROUND  In March 2020  the Norwegian government announced a COVID-19 lockdown in order to reduce the spread of the coronavirus  In Norway  lockdown measures included restricting people s ability to leave their home and the closing of social institutions  thus reducing the capacity for victims of intimate partner violence to alert someone outside of their home about violent incidents that occurred during lockdown  At the same time  the restrictive measures forced the victim and the perpetrator to stay together for prolonged periods within the home  and reduced the possibility for them to escape or leave the perpetrator  The aim of this study was to investigate how the frequency and character of intimate partner violence reported to the police changed during the period of lockdown in Norway  METHODS  All cases of intimate partner violence registered in police files before the pandemic  from January 2016-February 2020  and during lockdown in Norway  March-December 2020  were included in the study  representing a total of 974 cases  Differences in the number and severity of cases were calculated using chi2-tests and Wilcoxon s rank sum test  Differences in the characteristics of the reported violence was assessed with the Brief Spousal Assault form for the Evaluation of Risk  B-SAFER  and tested with Fischer s exact test with Bonferroni correction  Standardised Morbidity Rate  SMR  statistics were used to analyse the proportion of immigrants as compared to the general population  RESULTS  Reported intimate partner violence increased by 54  during the lockdown period in Norway  Between March-December 2020  the police assessed the cases as being at higher risk of imminent and severe violence  Our findings indicated an overrepresentation of immigrant perpetrators before and during lockdown  SMR   1 814  95  CI   1 792-1 836 before  and SMR   1 807  95  CI   1 742-1 872 during lockdown   Notably  while victims with an immigrant background were overrepresented before lockdown  we found significantly lower proportion of immigrant IPV victims during the lockdown period  SMR   1 070  95  CI   1 052-1 087 before  and SMR   0 835  CI 95  CI   0 787-0 883 during lockdown   Also  there were significantly more female perpetrators and male victims reported to the police during the lockdown period  A higher proportion of the victims were assessed as having unsafe living conditions and personal problems during lockdown  Finally  during the lockdown period in Norway  a higher proportion of perpetrators had a history of intimate relationship problems  CONCLUSIONS  Intimate partner violence increased dramatically during the COVID-19 lockdown  A range of options for victims to escape from their perpetrators  particularly during times of crisis  should be developed in line with good practice  and with a special focus on the most vulnerable victims,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915874
50,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  warns the use of one-way valves or vents in face masks for potential threat of spreading COVID-19 through expelled respiratory droplets  Here  we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as a membrane filter in the one-way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading  A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers  ZnO NFs  with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins  responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells  The study also confirmed significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface  revealing removal of the virus upon efficient trapping  Following the computational study  we have synthesized ZnO NF on a cotton matrix using a hydrothermal-assisted strategy  Electron-microscopic  steady-state  and picosecond-resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton  i e   cellulose  matrix at the atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric  A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria  model SARS-CoV-2 mimic  reveals excellent antimicrobial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric  To our understanding  the nanoceutical fabric used in the one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection  The developed nanosensitized cloth can also be used as an antibacterial anti CoV-2 washable dress material in general,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006728

1820,Aneurysms represent bulging of the weakened blood vessel area  as a result of cystic medial degeneration  Aneurysms chance of rupturing increases over time  resulting in bleeding and death  Therefore  patients with aortic aneurysms require frequent monitoring with magnetic resonance and computed tomography angiography  as well as undergoing open repair surgery and endovascular aneurysm repair  We present a case of ruptured thoracic aortic aneurysm in conjunction with bilateral superficial femoral occlusion  as incidental findings in Covid-19 positive patient  The patient  a 62-years-old female  presented with cough  shortness of breath  fever and leg claudication  Doppler ultrasonography of the lower limbs was conducted to rule out thromboembolism  revealing bilateral superficial femoral arteries occlusion  The patient was administered high doses of parenteral anticoagulants  Hemoptysis ensued  prompting an MSCT scan  that showed right pleural effusion  atelectasis  and right active perihilar infiltrates with inter-lobar pleurisy  Due to inflammatory changes on the lung parenchyma  the patient got tested for Sars-Cov-2  and resulted positive  Contrast-enhanced MSCT also revealed thoracic-abdominal aortic aneurysm with its highest diameter measuring 10 cm  and massive per-aortal thrombus and or hematoma of 5 cm  which was further ruptured and patient died untreated in the fourth day of hospitalization  Questions arise whether Covid-19 was the primary cause of bilateral superficial femoral artery occlusion and whether high doses of parenteral anticoagulants were the primary cause of thoracic aortic aneurysm rupture  Thus  a careful balance must be made between the detrimental and protective contributions of anticoagulants in the patients presenting with Covid-19 and thoracic-abdominal aortic aneurysm,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976254
673,BACKGROUND  Among all of the studied potential causes of autism  vaccines have received some of the most scrutiny and have been the topic of many evidence-based studies  These efforts have led the great majority of scientists  physicians  and public health researchers to refute causation between vaccines and autism  RATIONALE  This presumed association and concern has been a major contributor to parents  refusal to immunize their children and has become a major threat to public health in secluded populations over the last two decades  even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic  With the emergence of COVID-19 immunizations  sentiments towards this topic were addressed as a public health concern that may influence the ability to overcome the Corona virus worldwide  SCIENTIFIC REVIEW OF DATA  Despite the overwhelming data demonstrating that there is no link between vaccines and autism  many parents are hesitant to immunize their children because of the alleged association  Other contributing factors to the myths and conspiracy theories surrounding the association between vaccines and autism include the fact that the diagnosis of autism is typically made after the age of receiving the main childhood immunizations  as well as the occasional occurrence of regression after the age of first year vaccinations  In spite of vast evidence that the main contribution to the increase in incidence is from improvement of the diagnostic process  this rapid and publicized rise in autism diagnoses feeds parental concerns regarding any medical intervention that may be associated with the health of their children  RECOMMENDATIONS  It is plausible that with more evidence-based studies linking autism to specific etiologies the myth will diminish and disappear eventually  In an era where conspiracy theories are prevalent on social media  it is critical that evidence-based studies relating autism to specific etiologies be made public  and that information concerning autism diagnosis and causes be made more readily available through social media and parental organizations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996019

303,Background  Pooled specimen screening for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  can improve laboratory testing capacity  This study assessed the impact of pooling and retesting individual swabs on the overall detection rate and reduction in the frequency of retesting  Methods  One hundred respiratory swabs specimens were tested individually and in pools of three or five samples using the Cepheid s Xpert  R   Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test kit  The optimum number of samples per pool was calculated using the application  A Shiny App for Pooled Testing   Results  Twenty-five pools were generated from 101 samples  Out of 13 pools that contained five samples each  three pools gave true positive results  While out of the 12 pools that contained three samples each  five pools gave true positive results  Four samples gave a false negative pool result  The overall sensitivity and specificity of the assay in the pools were 66 6  and 100   respectively  The cycle threshold was reduced in most of the pools compared to individual sample tests  Conclusion  The overall pooled test had a remarkable impact on laboratory resources  Yet  caution is warranted when selecting the cases for pooled testing  since the reduction in sensitivity can significantly impact and increase the risk of exposure to infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002494
847,The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout is critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections  hospitalizations  and deaths worldwide  Unfortunately  massive disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations  including people living with HIV  Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised individuals  This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy  Here  we evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine expressing Spike protein  A 1  from SARS-CoV-2  repRNA-CoV2S  in immunocompromised  SIV infected and immune competent  naive pigtail macaques  Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and naive animals  Furthermore  vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior to immunization  This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and other immunocompromised individuals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992610
8066,BACKGROUND  Nosocomial outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported sporadically since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  We sought to study the transmission dynamics in a nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak in our centre  METHODS  This was a retrospective cohort study in a 500 bedded tertiary care hospital in South India  Inpatients who were suspected to have likely or definite hospital-acquired COVID-19 and hospital staff members who were found to be COVID-19 positive during the same time frame were studied and the likely transmission dynamics described  RESULTS  During the study period  173 patients were diagnosed to have COVID-19  out of which  15  8 6   patients who fulfilled the criteria for likely or definitely hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection were identified from six different wards  During the same period  121 hospital staff members were diagnosed with COVID-19  Out of these  18  14 9   hospital staff members were identified who could have been the potential source of infection for these 15 patients based on the overlap of location of the staff and the patients  and their infectivity windows  Direct contact and fomite transmission were likely the predominant driver of transmission in our study as there was use of universal face masks and face shields  CONCLUSION  Despite the admission of a large number of COVID-19 patients and a relatively large proportion of hospital staff members who tested positive for the disease  the proportion of nosocomial COVID-19 in our centre remained low  A policy of universal gloving  coupled with the already existing practice of universal N95 masking and face shield use  could potentially bring down the rate of nosocomial COVID-19 even further,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882129

3424,Since the start of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders given as early as March 16  2020  routine dental care has experienced a sharp interruption  This challenging time has provided an opportunity for healthcare professionals to use and collaborate with available technologies in a meaningful way  One of the silver linings for dental professionals during this time has been the use of teledentistry  While it is not a replacement for a clinical examination  studies show that teledentistry can be utilized to triage cases  maintain contact with patients  and successfully identify abnormal oral lesions  This article explains both the benefits and barriers of teledentistry that specifically apply to pandemic conditions  providing examples of how this modality can be used by different specialties in dentistry  Additionally  the article proposes models of how teledentistry can be effectively integrated in two different settings  the private practice model and dental schools,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951942
4981,With the improvement in the understanding of COVID-19 and the widespread vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines in various countries  the epidemic will be brought under control soon  However  multiple viruses could result in the post-viral syndrome  which is also common among patients with COVID-19  Therefore  the long-term consequences and the corresponding treatment of COVID-19 should be the focus in the post-epidemic era  In this review  we summarize the therapeutic strategies for the complications and sequelae of eight major systems caused by COVID-19  including respiratory system  cardiovascular system  neurological system  digestive system  urinary system  endocrine system  reproductive system and skeletal complication  In addition  we also sorted out the side effects reported in the vaccine trials  The purpose of this article is to remind people of possible complications and sequelae of COVID-19 and provide robust guidance on the treatment  It is extremely important to conduct long-term observational prognosis research on a larger scale  so as to have a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the human body and reduce complications to the greatest extent,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926504
7036,Infectious diseases  such as the current COVID-19  have a huge economic and societal impact  The ability to model its transmission characteristics is critical to minimize its impact  In fact  predicting how fast an infection is spreading could be a major factor in deciding on the severity  extent and strictness of the applied mitigation measures  such as the recent lockdowns  Even though modelling epidemics is a well studied subject  usually models do not include quarantine or other social measures  such as those imposed in the recent pandemic  The current work builds upon a recent paper by Maier and Brockmann  2020   where a compartmental SIRX model was implemented  That model included social or individual behavioural changes during quarantine  by introducing state X   in which symptomatic quarantined individuals are not transmitting the infection anymore  and described well the transmission in the initial stages of the infection  The results of the model were applied to real data from several provinces in China  quite successfully  In our approach we use a Monte-Carlo simulation model on networks  Individuals are network nodes and the links are their contacts  We use a spreading mechanism from the initially infected nodes to their nearest neighbours  as has been done previously  Initially  we find the values of the rate constants  parameters  the same way as in Maier and Brockmann  2020  for the confirmed cases of a country  on a daily basis  as given by the Johns Hopkins University  We then use different types of networks  random Erdos-Renyi  Small World  and Barabasi-Albert Scale-Free  with various characteristics in an effort to find the best fit with the real data for the same geographical regions as reported in Maier and Brockmann  2020   Our simulations show that the best fit comes with the Erdos-Renyi random networks  We then apply this method to several other countries  both for large-size countries  and small size ones  In all cases investigated we find the same result  i e  best agreement for the evolution of the pandemic with time is for the Erdos-Renyi networks  Furthermore  our results indicate that the best fit occurs for a random network with an average degree of the order of < k > approximately 10-25  for all countries tested  Scale Free and Small World networks fail to fit the real data convincingly,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898823

561,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing SARS-CoV-2 mild and severe outcomes  In vaccinated subjects with SARS-CoV-2 history  RBD-specific IgG and pseudovirus neutralization titers were rapidly recalled by a single BTN162b2 vaccine dose to higher levels than those in naive recipients after the second dose  irrespective of waning immunity  In this study  we inspected the long-term kinetic and neutralizing responses of S-specific IgG induced by two administrations of BTN162b2 vaccine in infection-naive subjects and in subjects previously infected with SARS-CoV-2  METHODS  Twenty-six naive and 9 previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects during the second wave of the pandemic in Italy were enrolled for this study  The two groups had comparable demographic and clinical characteristics  By means of ELISA and pseudotyped-neutralization assays  we investigated the kinetics of developed IgG-RBD and their neutralizing activity against both the ancestral D614G and the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern emerged later  respectively  The Wilcoxon matched pair signed rank test and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn s correction for multiple comparison were applied when needed  RESULTS  Although after 15 weeks from vaccination IgG-RBD dropped in all participants  naive subjects experienced a more dramatic decline than those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection  Neutralizing antibodies remained higher in subjects with SARS-CoV-2 history and conferred broad-spectrum protection  CONCLUSIONS  These data suggest that hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has a relevant impact on the development of IgG-RBD upon vaccination  However  the rapid decay of vaccination-elicited antibodies highlights that the administration of a third dose is expected to boost the response and acquire high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34998405
1544,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global crisis  creating an unprecedented situation  which has taken the world by storm  overshadowing on all life  aspects and having a significant impact on the health systems of most countries  In this study  the delivery of health services is investigated both before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at public hospitals in Yemen to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the utilisation of health services  METHOD  Data collected from 127 hospitals in Yemen were reviewed using the DHIS2 system  The data represented 3 months before the outbreak of COVID-19 between January and March 2020 and during the outbreak of COVID-19 outbreak between April and June 2020  The results were then compared with the same period in 2019  The utilisation pattern of healthcare services during the period of investigation was compiled and analysed by applying a generalised estimating equation  GEE  to examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen  The data collected from the targeted hospitals included information related to consultations  surgeries  deliveries  C-sections and penta-3rd dose immunisation  RESULTS  The trendline of health services used during the pandemic showed a gradual decline beginning from April 2020 for consultations  surgeries and penta-3rd dose utilisation  The GEE model revealed a significant effect  p<0 05  during the outbreak compared with preoutbreak in the consultation services  B -1 343 9  95  CI -1 767 2 to -920 6  chi 2  38 718   surgeries  B -54 98  95  CI -79 13 to -30 83  chi 2  19 911  and penta-3rd dose  B -24 47  95  CI -30 56 to -18 38 and chi 2  62 010   As for deliveries and C-sections  the results were shown to be statistically non-significant  CONCLUSION  The impact of COVID-19 on continuity of health services delivery in Yemen has been distinct and profound  where the study revealed that the number of the consultations  surgeries and number of vaccinated children have been declined during the COVID-19 pandemic  likely due to the partially lockdown measures taken and fear of being infected  However  the deliveries and C-section services remained nearly in the same level and did not affect by the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980605

2622,The effect of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  on patients receiving conventional immunosuppressive  IS  therapy has yet to be fully determined  however  research on using IS therapy for treating COVID-19 in acutely ill patients is increasing  While some believe that IS therapy may be protective  others argue that these agents may make patients more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and morbidity and advocate for a more cautious  individualized approach to determining continuation  reduction  or discontinuation of therapy  In this review  we aim to provide an overview of COVID-19 risk in dermatological patients who are receiving conventional IS therapies  including mycophenolate mofetil  methotrexate  cyclosporine  azathioprine  apremilast  JAK inhibitors  and systemic steroids  Additionally  we provide recommendations for management of these medications for dermatological patients during the COVID-19 pandemic  Treatment of dermatological disease during the COVID-19 pandemic should involve shared decision-making between the patient and provider  with consideration of each patient s comorbidities and the severity of the patient s dermatological disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962304
4813,The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   has increasingly attracted worldwide concern  Liver damage or dysfunction occurred in patients with COVID-19  mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels   However  it is not yet clear whether the COVID-19-related liver injury is mainly caused by the virus infection  potentially hepatotoxic drugs  or other coexisting conditions  Progression of pre-existing chronic liver disease  CLD  may be the underlying mechanism of liver injury  Although COVID-19 patients with CLD  such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease  liver cirrhosis  and liver cancer  have been deemed at increased risk for serious illness in many studies  little is known about the impact of CLD on the natural history and outcome of COVID-19 patients  Thereby  based on the latest evidence from case reports and case series  this paper discusses the clinical manifestations  treatment  prognosis  and management of the COVID-19 patients with different CLD  This article also reviews the effect of COVID-19 on liver transplantation patients  LT   hoping to work for future prevention  management  and control measures of COVID-19  However  due to the lack of relevant research  most of them are still limited to the theoretical stage  further study of COVID-19 and CLD needs to be improved in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929350
188,Policy measures to control the spread of COVID-19 imposed by different countries have a devastating impact on people s travel behaviors  Differing from the normal situation where general concerns on travel time and cost determine the travel choices  the uncertainty underlying behavior change in the case of a pandemic might be largely attributed to the latent aspects  i e   social responsibility  risk perception  attitudes  which could diminish the effects of main attributes on travel decisions  Therefore  this paper examines the effects of COVID-19 related policies on individuals  travel choices influenced by the latent aspects  A stated choice experiment was designed to collect people s responses under policy measures to various transportation modes  Results of a hybrid choice model show that COVID-19 related policies significantly affect individuals  transportation mode choice decisions during pandemic situations  The attributes  like travel time and travel cost  which significantly impact travel behavior in normal situations  become less relevant  Moreover  the travel preferences during the pandemic are significantly associated with latent factors of social responsibility  fear of infection  perceived risk  and travel anxiety  In general  public transportation is identified as an insecure alternative compared with other private modes  and people who are more socially responsible tend to travel less during the pandemic  Outcomes of this study could be of value to policymakers and public health emergencies  e g   government authorities to utilize such knowledge in providing social support for these COVID-19 countermeasures and designing customized policies for specific population groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004132

8092,OBJECTIVES  We designed an electronic query that was distributed to healthcare workers in order to evaluate their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination of women that wish to conceive and those that are pregnant  METHODS  An electronic survey was designed and distributed through a network of 5 654 e-mails  The query was uploaded in Google Forms  RESULTS  Overall  1 226 answers were retrieved  Ninety percent of respondents replied that they prescribe COVID-19 vaccination in women that wish to conceive  however  the rate falls to 80  for those that have schedules for imminent artificial reproductive techniques  Approximately 1 in 2 physicians  obstetricians and pediatricians  suggests that a delay in assisted reproduction following immunization is not recommended  At least 13  of women of reproductive age and 30  of women wishing to conceive with ART declined to do so according to respondents  report  Only 75  of respondents favored immunization during pregnancy and of those 48  responded that vaccination could be done in all trimesters of pregnancy  Approximately 40  of women decline  however  to receive vaccination  CONCLUSIONS  Despite the directions provided by international organizations  physician and patient hesitancy towards vaccination during pregnancy  and particularly the first trimester  remains an issue that deserves further attention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881548
1834,The lungs are constantly exposed to non-sterile air which carries harmful threats  such as particles and pathogens  Nonetheless  this organ is equipped with fast and efficient mechanisms to eliminate these threats from the airways as well as prevent pathogen invasion  The respiratory tract is densely innervated by sensory neurons  also known as nociceptors  which are responsible for the detection of external stimuli and initiation of physiological and immunological responses  Furthermore  expression of functional innate receptors by nociceptors have been reported  however  the influence of these receptors to the lung function and local immune response is poorly described  The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of coordinated and competent pulmonary immunity for the prevention of pathogen spread as well as prevention of excessive tissue injury  New findings suggest that lung nociceptors can be a target of SARS-CoV-2 infection  what remains unclear is whether innate receptor trigger sensory neuron activation during SARS-CoV-2 infection and what is the relevance for the outcomes  Moreover  elderly individuals often present with respiratory  neurological and immunological dysfunction  Whether aging in the context of sensory nerve function and innate receptors contributes to the disorders of these systems is currently unknown  Here we discuss the expression of innate receptors by nociceptors  particularly in the lungs  and the possible impact of their activation on pulmonary immunity  We then demonstrate recent evidence that suggests lung sensory neurons as reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 and possible viral recognition via innate receptors  Lastly  we explore the mechanisms by which lung nociceptors might contribute to disturbance in respiratory and immunological responses during the aging process,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975876
8332,Inflammation is one of the primary factors associated with the causation and or progression of several lifestyle disorders  including obesity  type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease  NAFLD   NAFLD is a spectrum of disorders  and starts with simple steatosis  progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  and then advances to fibrosis  cirrhosis and finally  hepatocellular carcinoma  due to perpetual cycles of insults caused by inflammation and other cellular stress  Emerging evidence has documented that patients with NAFLD have severe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   and patients with COVID-19 have a higher liver injury and mortality  Although the exact cause or mechanism is not known  inflammatory cytokine storm is a characteristic feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection and is known to be associated with higher mortality among COVID-19 patients  Therefore  the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be a major concern in NAFLD patients  who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop COVID-19  This is evident in patients at any stage of the NAFLD spectrum  as the inflammatory cytokine storm may cause and or aggravate the progression or severity of NAFLD  Thus  there is a need for resolution of the inflammatory cytokine storm in these patients  A large body of evidence has demonstrated the efficacy of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids  omega-3 LCPUFA  in NAFLD conditions  due to their anti-inflammatory  immunomodulatory and anti-viral properties  Therefore  intervention with omega-3 LCPUFA  an effective pharmaconutrient along with the standard treatment for COVID-19 may be useful in the management of the NAFLD spectrum in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing NAFLD conditions by resolving the inflammatory cytokine storm and thereby attenuating its progression  Although there are challenges in implementation  optimistically they can be circumvented and the pharmaconutrition strategy may be potentially helpful in tackling both the pandemics  NAFLD and COVID-19 at least in this subset of patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877270

6258,This paper studies the labor market effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  to combat the COVID-19 pandemic  We focus on the Nordic countries which showed one of the highest variations in NPIs despite having similar community spread of COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic  While Denmark  Finland and Norway imposed strict measures   lockdowns    Sweden decided for much lighter restrictions  Empirically  we use novel administrative data on weekly new unemployment and furlough spells from all 56 regions of the Nordic countries to compare the labor market outcomes of Sweden with the ones of its neighbors  Our evidence suggests that the labor markets of all countries were severely hit by the pandemic  although Sweden performed slightly better than its neighbors  Specifically  we find the worsening of the Swedish labor market to occur around 2 to 3 weeks later than in the other Nordic countries  and that its cumulative sum of new unemployment and furlough spells remained significantly lower  about 20-25   during the time period of our study  up to week 21 of 2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908590
5365,Response measures to mitigate the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic impacted access to routine vaccination services  We evaluate the impact of the pandemic on routine infant vaccination uptake by comparing vaccination coverage  vaccine delays and doses administered in 2019 and 2020  in Quebec  Canada  Using a population-based vaccination registry  we compared vaccination coverage at 3  5  13 and 19 months of age between 2019 and 2020 cohorts each month from January to November  For vaccine delays  we measured the cumulative proportion vaccinated in each targeted cohort monthly  We also compared the measles-containing vaccines administered before 24 months of age between the same period in 2019 and 2020  A decline in vaccination coverage and children vaccinated on time was observed in all cohorts during the first months of the pandemic  The greatest impact was observed for the 18-month vaccination visit with a difference in vaccination coverage between both cohorts of 30 9  in May  Measles-containing doses administered during the first months of the pandemic were lower in 2020 compared with 2019  -21 1  in March  95 CI-21 6 -20 4   and -39 2  in April  95 CI-40 0 -38 2   After May  the coverage increased for all cohorts to reach pre-pandemic levels after a few months for most target ages  Routine childhood vaccinations were affected during the first months of the pandemic  but catch-up occurred thereafter and vaccination coverage in affected cohorts were very close to levels of 2019 after a few months of follow-up  Real-time monitoring of childhood vaccination is essential but also for other vaccination programs  severely affected by the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920686
2425,Binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein to cell receptors is vital for the entry of the virus into cells and subsequent infection  ACE2 is the main cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2  which can attach to the C-terminal receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein  The GRP78 receptor plays an anchoring role  which attaches to the RBD and increases the chance of other RBDs binding to ACE2  Although high levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species  RONS  are produced during viral infections  it is not clear how they affect the RBD structure and its binding to ACE2 and GRP78  In this research  we apply molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of oxidation of the highly reactive cysteine  Cys  amino acids of the RBD on its binding to ACE2 and GRP78  The interaction energy of both ACE2 and GRP78 with the whole RBD  as well as with the RBD main regions  is compared in both the native and oxidized RBDs  Our results show that the interaction energy between the oxidized RBD and ACE2 is strengthened by 155 kJ mol  increasing the binding of the RBD to ACE2 after oxidation  In addition  the interaction energy between the RBD and GRP78 is slightly increased by 8 kJ mol after oxidation  but this difference is not significant  Overall  these findings highlight the role of RONS in the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein to host cell receptors and suggest an alternative mechanism by which RONS could modulate the entrance of viral particles into the cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34965734
6255,To understand the extent to which a policy instrument s early adoption is crucial in crisis management  we leverage unique worldwide data that record the daily evolution of policy mandate adoptions and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates  The analysis shows that the mask mandate is consistently associated with lower infection rates in the short term  and its early adoption boosts the long-term efficacy  By contrast  the other five policy instruments-domestic lockdowns  international travel bans  mass gathering bans  and restaurant and school closures-show weaker efficacy  Governments prepared for a public health crisis with stronger resilience or capacity and those with stronger collectivist cultures were quicker to adopt nationwide mask mandates  From a policy design perspective  policymakers must avoid overreacting with less effective instruments and underreacting with more effective ones during uncertain times  especially when interventions differ in efficacy and cost,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908595
4176,Purpose  To compare food safety knowledge  attitudes  and self-reported practices among medical staff in China before  during  and after the COVID-19 pandemic  Patients and Methods  The questionnaire was anonymous  All respondents were Chinese medical personnel  A Chi-square contingency table was used to compare the knowledge and attitudes of Chinese medical staff before  during and after COVID-19  R statistical software  v4 0 0  was used for analysis  Results  A total of 1431 valid responses  57 3  from female respondents  were included in our analysis  Medical professionals were geographically distributed as follows  eastern China  55 5   central China  19 7   western China  24 1   Hong Kong  Macau  or Taiwan  0 05   Medical professionals reported that they paid greater attention to food safety after the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the epidemic  Self-reported knowledge of and attitudes toward food safety among medical staff were significantly different before  during  and after the COVID-19 pandemic  both P<0 001   Conclusion  After the COVID-19 pandemic  medical professionals paid increasing attention to food safety  which is a clinically important change  Because medical professionals can influence public understanding of food safety  their increased attention to this subject may enable them to promote food safety knowledge more actively in their work  This may in turn promote a better understanding of food safety and protect the health of the general public,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938138
6650,Urbanization introduces the threat of increased epidemic disease transmission resulting from crowding on mass transit  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  which has directly led to over 600 000 deaths in the US as of July 2021  triggered mass social distancing policies to be enacted as a key deterrent of widespread infections  Social distancing can be challenging in confined spaces required for transportation such as mass transit systems  Little is published regarding the degree to which mass transit system adoption effects impacted the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic in urban centers  Taking an ecological approach where areal data are the unit of observation  this national-scale study aims to measure the association between the adoption of mass transit and COVID-19 spread through confirmed cases in US metropolitan areas  National survey-based transit adoption measures are entered in negative binomial regression models to evaluate differences between areas  The model results demonstrate that mass transit adoption in US metropolitan areas was associated with the magnitude of outbreaks  Higher incidence of COVID-19 early in the pandemic was associated with survey results conveying higher transit use  Increasing weekly bus transit usage in metropolitan statistical areas by one scaled unit was associated with a 1 38  95  CI   1 25  1 90   times increase in incidence rate of COVID-19  a one scaled unit increase in weekly train transit usage was associated with an increase in incidence rate of 1 54  95  CI   1 42  2 07   times  These conclusions should inform early action practices in urban centers with busy transit systems in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks  Deeper understanding of these observed associations may also benefit modeling efforts by allowing researchers to include mathematical adjustments or better explain caveats to results when communicating with decision makers and the public in the crucial early stages of an epidemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902421

6330,Double membrane vesicles  DMVs  serve as replication organelles of plus-strand RNA viruses such as hepatitis C virus  HCV  and SARS-CoV-2  Viral DMVs are morphologically analogous to DMVs formed during autophagy  but lipids driving their biogenesis are largely unknown  Here we show that production of the lipid phosphatidic acid  PA  by acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase  AGPAT  1 and 2 in the ER is important for DMV biogenesis in viral replication and autophagy  Using DMVs in HCV-replicating cells as model  we found that AGPATs are recruited to and critically contribute to HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication and proper DMV formation  An intracellular PA sensor accumulated at viral DMV formation sites  consistent with elevated levels of PA in fractions of purified DMVs analyzed by lipidomics  Apart from AGPATs  PA is generated by alternative pathways and their pharmacological inhibition also impaired HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication as well as formation of autophagosome-like DMVs  These data identify PA as host cell lipid involved in proper replication organelle formation by HCV and SARS-CoV-2  two phylogenetically disparate viruses causing very different diseases  i e  chronic liver disease and COVID-19  respectively  Host-targeting therapy aiming at PA synthesis pathways might be suitable to attenuate replication of these viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907161
8995,COVID-19  the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection  can assume a highly variable disease course  ranging from asymptomatic infection  which constitutes the majority of cases  to severe respiratory failure  This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2  However  the immunological underpinnings underlying these divergent disease courses remain elusive  We therefore set out to longitudinally characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity  Our unique convalescent COVID-19 cohort consists of 74 patients not confounded by comorbidities  This is the first study of which we are aware that excludes immune abrogations associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 related risk factors of disease severity  Patients were followed up and analyzed longitudinally  2  4 and 6 weeks after infection  by high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMCs   in-depth serum analytics  and transcriptomics  Immune phenotypes were correlated to disease severity  Convalescence was overall associated with uniform immune signatures  but distinct immune signatures for mildly versus severely affected patients were detectable within a 2-week time window after infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867933

5316,BACKGROUND  Cognitive interviewing is a well-established qualitative method used to develop and refine PRO measures  A range of digital technologies including phone  web conferencing  and electronic survey platforms can be leveraged to support the conduct of cognitive interviewing in both children and adults  These technologies offer a potential solution to enrolling underrepresented populations  including those with rare conditions  functional limitations and geographic or socioeconomic barriers  In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic  the use of digital technologies for qualitative interviewing will remain essential  However  there is limited guidance about adapting cognitive interviewing procedures to allow for remote data capture  especially with children  METHODS  Synthesizing the literature and our research experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic  we examine considerations for implementing digitally supported cognitive interviews with children  adolescents  and adults  We offer recommendations to optimize data quality and empirical rigor and illustrate the application of these recommendations in an ongoing cognitive interviewing study to develop and refine a new pediatric PRO measure  RESULTS  Good research practices must address participant and researcher preparation for study-related procedures and should anticipate and pre-emptively manage technological barriers  Field notes should detail interview context  audio video cues  and any impact of technological difficulties on data quality  The approaches we recommend have been tested in an ongoing cognitive interviewing study that is enrolling children adolescents with cGVHD ages 5-17 and their caregivers  NCT04044365   The combined use of telephone and videoconferencing to conduct cognitive interviews remotely is feasible and acceptable and yields meaningful data to improve the content validity of our new PRO measure of cGVHD symptom bother  CONCLUSION  Digitally supported cognitive interviewing procedures will be increasingly employed  Remote data collection can accelerate accrual  particularly in multi-site studies  and may allow for interviewer personnel and data management to be centralized within a coordinating center  thus conserving resources  Research is needed to further test and refine techniques for remote cognitive interviewing  particularly in traditionally underrepresented populations  including children and non-English speakers  Expansion of international standards to address digitally supported remote qualitative data capture appears warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921668
6217,Essential workers such as medical workers and police officers are first-line fighters during public-health crises  such as COVID-19 pandemic  Every time  they are under heavy stress both physically and mentally  The goal of the present study was to develop a novel nature-based intervention to promote their well-being  A representative sample of essential workers in China was recruited for a five-day intervention program  and were randomly assigned to two groups  The experimental group watched 2-min video clips of natural scenes every day  while the control group watched urban scenes  Results indicated that after five days  the natural stimuli intervention yielded overall improvements in various indices of subjective well-being  Furthermore  analyses of nested longitudinal data confirmed that everyday nature stimuli exposure provided both immediate and repeated restorative benefits  The proposed natural-based intervention is brief and easy-to-use  offering a cost-efficient psychological booster to promote subjective well-being of essential workers during this crisis time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908644
1758,Children have been described to show neurological symptoms in acute coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children  MIS-C   We present a 2-year-old boy s clinical course of unilateral acute sixth nerve palsy in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  Onset of the palsy in the otherwise healthy boy occurred seven days after symptoms attributed to acute infection had subsided respectively 3 weeks after onset of respiratory symptoms  SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG was detected in serum as well as in cerebrospinal fluid  The patient showed a prolonged but self-limiting course with a full recovery after three and a half months  This case illustrates in a detailed chronological sequence that sixth cranial nerve involvement may occur as post-infectious  self-limiting complication of pediatric SARS-CoV-2-infection thus expanding the neurological spectrum of symptoms for children with COVID-19  Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of post-infectious sixth nerve palsy related to SARS-CoV-2-infection particularly in view of recent respiratory tract infection or confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2-infection amongst the patient s close contacts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976891
6918,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is currently the most important emerging pathogen worldwide  but its early transcriptional dynamics and host immune response remain unclear  Herein  the expression profiles of viral interactions with different types of hosts were comprehensively dissected to shed light on the early infection strategy of SARS-CoV-2 and the host immune response against infection  SARS-CoV-2 was found to exhibit a two-stage transcriptional strategy within the first 24 h of infection  comprising a lag phase that ends with the virus being paused and a log phase that starts when the viral load increases rapidly  Interestingly  the host innate immune response was found not to be activated  latent period  until the virus entered the log stage  Noteworthy  when intracellular immunity is suppressed  SARS-CoV-2 shows a correlation with dysregulation of metal ion homeostasis  Herein  the inhibitory activity of copper ions against SARS-CoV-2 was further validated in in vitro experiments  Coronavirus disease 2019-related genes  including CD38  PTX3  and TCN1  were also identified  which may serve as candidate host-restricted factors for interventional therapy  Collectively  these results confirm that the two-stage strategy of SARS-CoV-2 effectively aids its survival in early infection by regulating the host intracellular immunity  highlighting the key role of interferon in viral infection and potential therapeutic candidates for further investigations on antiviral strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899651
2024,The potential of lung ultrasound  LUS  has become manifest in the light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic  The need for a point-of care  quantitative  and widely available assessment of lung condition is critical  However  conventional ultrasound imaging was never designed for lung assessment  This limits LUS to the subjective and qualitative interpretation of artifacts and imaging patterns visible on ultrasound images  A number of research groups have begun to tackle this limitation  and this special issue reports on their most recent findings  Through in silico  in vitro  and in vivo studies  preclinical animal studies and pilot clinical studies on human subjects   the research presented aims at understanding and modelling the physical phenomena involved in ultrasound propagation  and at leveraging these phenomena to extract semi-quantitative and quantitative information relevant to estimate changes in lung structure  These studies are the first steps in unlocking the full potential of lung ultrasound as a relevant tool for lung assessment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972307

337,The coronavirus pandemic lockdowns have led to an increase of caregiving and household responsibilities for many employees while working from home  We aimed to investigate whether there was a gender imbalance in the division of household labour within families during the pandemic  and whether this imbalance was associated with gender differences in personal outcomes  work-family conflict  burnout  as well as career-related outcomes  career self-efficacy and aspirations   Participants were 240 heterosexual individuals with or without caregiving responsibilities who lived with a partner and worked from home during the pandemic  They completed self-report questionnaires and indicated the division of domestic tasks within their household  the extent to which they experienced burnout and work-family conflict  and their career aspirations and career self-efficacy  The findings showed a significant gender imbalance  such that female caregivers spent significantly less time on work compared to the other groups and significantly more time on caregiving compared to male caregivers during the lockdown  There was a significant direct effect of caregiving on career outcomes for women  such that the more caregiving women performed during the lockdown relative to other tasks  the more negative their self-reported career outcomes were  Among men  caregiving did not predict career outcomes  Overall  our study showed that the gender imbalance in distributions of caregiving duties during the pandemic is associated with negative personal and professional outcomes for women who are caregivers  Practical implications are discussed accounting for this gender imbalance in the context of the pandemic and its influence on wellbeing and career outcomes  particularly for heterosexual women  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s12144-021-02630-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002182
681,The emergence and rapid global spread of the new Delta and  more recently  Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 pose a daunting public health emergency  Being an RNA virus  the Covid-19 virus is continuing to mutate  resulting in the emergence of new variants with high transmissibility  such as the recently discovered Omicron variant  In this paper  we consider the conditions that may facilitate viral mutations and the emergence of variants with the ability to evade immunity  Here  we have discussed the importance of vaccination with the currently available vaccines  These vaccines are highly effective at preventing serious disease  hospitalization  and death from Covid-19  However  the antibody response induced by these vaccines is short-lasting and there are reports of breakthrough infections  A stable and persistent interaction between T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells is needed for robust B cell memory response  We discussed the potential reasons behind the breakthrough infections and underscored the importance of developing better second-generation vaccines that may not necessitate frequent booster immunizations and are preventive in nature  This may involve the development of multivalent vaccines and creating vaccines against other viral proteins including conserved proteins  Vaccine hesitancy remains a notable hurdle for implementing vaccination  Furthermore  we recommend different approaches to increase vaccine acceptance  which is a critical translational component of a successful vaccine strategy  These perspectives on overcoming the pandemic s current challenges provide strategies to contain SARS-CoV-2 globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995958

8280,OBJECTIVES  In this preliminary study we investigated cellular and humoral immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  antigens in blood samples from 14 recovered coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  patients and compared them to those in samples from 12 uninfected unvaccinated volunteers  METHODS  Cellular immunity was assessed by intracellular detection of IFN-gamma in CD3  T lymphocytes after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike  S1   nucleocapsid  NC   or receptor-binding domain  RBD  recombinant proteins or overlapping peptide pools covering the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike  membrane and nucleocapsid regions  The humoral response was examined by ELISAs and or chemiluminescence assays for the presence of serum IgG antibodies directed to SARS-CoV-2 proteins  RESULTS  We observed differences between humoral and cellular immune profiles in response to stimulation with the same proteins  Assays of IgG antibodies directed to SARS-CoV-2 NC  RBD and S1 S2 recombinant proteins were able to differentiate convalescent from uninfected unvaccinated groups  Cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 protein stimuli did not exhibit a specific response  as T cells from both individuals with no history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 and from recovered donors were able to produce IFN-gamma  CONCLUSIONS  Determination of the cellular immune response to stimulation with a pool of SARS-CoV-2 peptides but not with SARS-CoV-2 proteins is able to distinguish convalescent individuals from unexposed individuals  Regarding the humoral immune response  the screening for serum IgG antibodies directed to SARS-CoV-2 proteins has been shown to be specific for the response of recovered individuals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878034
4597,BACKGROUND  As a result of the Coronavirus Disease-2019  COVID-19  pandemic  providing health care while maintaining social distancing has resulted in the need to provide care remotely  support quarantined isolated individuals  monitor infected individuals and their close contacts  as well as disseminate accurate information regarding COVID-19 to the public  This has led to an unprecedented rapid expansion of digital tools to provide digitized virtual care globally  especially mobile phone facilitated health interventions  called mHealth  To help keep abreast of different mHealth and virtual care technologies being used internationally to facilitate patient care and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic we did a rapid investigation of solutions being deployed and considered in 4 countries  OBJECTIVE  To describe mHealth  and digital and contact tracing technologies being used in healthcare management of the COVID-19 pandemic among two high-income and two low-middle income countries  METHODS  We compared virtual care interventions used for COVID-19 management among two high-income  HI  countries  the UK and Canada  and two low-middle  LMI  countries  Kenya and Rwanda   We focused on interventions used to facilitate patient care and public health  Information regarding specific virtual care technologies was procured from a variety of resources including grey literature  government   health organization website  and co-authors  personal experiences as implementers of COVID-19 virtual care strategies  Search engine queries were performed to find health information that would be easily accessible to the general public  with keywords including  COVID-19    contact-tracing    tool-kit    telehealth   and  virtual care   in conjunction with corresponding national health authorities  RESULTS  We identified a variety of technologies in Canada  the UK  Rwanda  and Kenya being used for patient care and public health  The aforementioned countries are using both video and text message-based platforms to facilitate communication with HCPs  ex  WelTel  Zoom   Nationally-developed contact-tracing apps are provided free to the public  with most of them using Bluetooth-based technology  We identified that often multiple complimentary technologies are being utilized for different aspects of patient care and public health with the common purpose to disseminate information safely  There was negligible difference among the types of technologies used in both HI and LMI countries  although LMI implemented virtual care interventions earlier during the pandemic s first wave which may account for their effective response  CONCLUSIONS  Virtual care and mHealth technologies have evolved rapidly as a tool for health care support for both patient care and public health  It is evident that  on an international level  a variety of mHealth and virtual care interventions  often in combination  are required to be able to address patient care and public health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic  independent of a country s economic standing  CLINICALTRIAL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932498
300,The COVID-19 outbreak is emerging as a significant public health challenge  Excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines  also known as cytokine storm  is a severe clinical syndrome known to develop as a complication of infectious or inflammatory diseases  Clinical evidence suggests that the occurrence of cytokine storm in severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection is closely associated with the rapid deterioration and high mortality of severe cases  In this review  we aim to summarize the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the subsequent immunological events related to excessive cytokine production and inflammatory responses associated with ACE2-AngII signaling  An overview of the diagnosis and an update on current therapeutic regimens and vaccinations is also provided,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002503
3857,Starting in 2019  the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat that is difficult to monitor  SARS-CoV-2 is known to undergo frequent mutations  including SNPs and deletions  which seem to be transmitted together  forming clusters that define specific lineages  Reverse-Transcription quantitative PCR  RT-qPCR  has been used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and is still considered the gold standard method  Our Eukaryotic Host Pathogens Interaction  EHPI  laboratory received six SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from a Sicilian private analysis laboratory  four of which showed a dropout of the E gene  Our sequencing data revealed the presence of a synonymous mutation  c 26415 C > T  TAC > TAT  in the E gene of all four samples showing the dropout in RT-qPCR  Interestingly  these samples also harbored three other mutations  S137L-Orf1ab  N439K-S gene  A156S-N gene   which had a very low diffusion rate worldwide  This combination suggested that these mutations may be linked to each other and more common in a specific area than in the rest of the world  Thus  we decided to analyze the 103 sequences in our internal database in order to confirm or disprove our  mutation cluster hypothesis   Within our database  one sample showed the synonymous mutation  c 26415 C > T  TAC > TAT  in the E gene  This work underlines the importance of territorial epidemiological surveillance by means of NGS and the sequencing of samples with clinical and or technical particularities  e g   post-vaccine infections or RT-qPCR amplification failures  to allow for the early identification of these SNPs  This approach may be an effective method to detect new mutational clusters and thus to predict new emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages before they spread globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943523
1480,The rapid spread of the highly contagious Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 along with its high number of mutations in the spike gene has raised alarm about the effectiveness of current medical countermeasures  To address this concern  we measured neutralizing antibodies against Omicron in three important settings   1  post-vaccination sera after two and three immunizations with the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine   2  convalescent sera from unvaccinated individuals infected by different variants  and  3  clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies  Using a pseudovirus neutralization assay  we found that titers against Omicron were low or undetectable after two immunizations and in most convalescent sera  A booster vaccination significantly increased titers against Omicron to levels comparable to those seen against the ancestral  D614G  variant after two immunizations  Neither age nor sex were associated with differences in post-vaccination antibody responses  Only three of 24 therapeutic antibodies tested retained their full potency against Omicron and high-level resistance was seen against fifteen  These findings underscore the potential benefit of booster mRNA vaccines for protection against Omicron and the need for additional therapeutic antibodies that are more robust to highly mutated variants  One Sentence Summary  Third dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine significantly boosts neutralizing antibodies to the Omicron variant compared to a second dose  while neutralization of Omicron by convalescent sera  two-dose vaccine-elicited sera  or therapeutic antibodies is variable and often low,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981057
9896,The most promising way to prevent the explosive spread of COVID-19 infection is to achieve herd immunity through vaccination  It is therefore important to motivate those who are less willing to be vaccinated  To address this issue  we conducted an online survey of 6232 Japanese people to investigate age- and gender-dependent differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and the underlying psychological processes  We asked participants to read one of nine different messages about COVID-19 vaccination and rate their willingness to be vaccinated  We also collected their 17 social personality trait scores and demographic information  We found that males 10-20 years old were least willing to be vaccinated  We also found that prosocial traits are the driving force for young people  but the motivation in older people also depends on risk aversion and self-interest  Furthermore  an analysis of 9 different messages demonstrated that for young people  particularly males   the message emphasizing the majority s intention to vaccinate and scientific evidence for the safety of the vaccination had the strongest positive effect on the willingness to be vaccinated  suggesting that the  majority   scientific evidence  message nudges young people to show their prosocial nature in action,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853337
3460,Growing evidence has shown that Transmembrane Serine Protease 2  TMPRSS2  not only contributes to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  but is also closely associated with the incidence and progression of tumours  However  the correlation of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  and cancers  and the prognostic value and molecular function of TMPRSS2 in various cancers have not been fully understood  In this study  the expression  genetic variations  correlated genes  immune infiltration and prognostic value of TMPRSS2 were analysed in many cancers using different bioinformatics platforms  The observed findings revealed that the expression of TMPRSS2 was considerably decreased in many tumour tissues  In the prognostic analysis  the expression of TMPRSS2 was considerably linked with the clinical consequences of the brain  blood  colorectal  breast  ovarian  lung and soft tissue cancer  In protein network analysis  we determined 27 proteins as protein partners of TMPRSS2  which can regulate the progression and prognosis of cancer mediated by TMPRSS2  Besides  a high level of TMPRSS2 was linked with immune cell infiltration in various cancers  Furthermore  according to the pathway analysis of differently expressed genes  DEGs  with TMPRSS2 in lung  breast  ovarian and colorectal cancer  160 DEGs genes were found and were significantly enriched in respiratory system infection and tumour progression pathways  In conclusion  the findings of this study demonstrate that TMPRSS2 may be an effective biomarker and therapeutic target in various cancers in humans  and may also provide new directions for specific tumour patients to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection during the COVID-19 outbreak,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951103
7737,Location-based games  LBGs  are typically played outdoors  as moving in the game is done by moving in the real world  However  during the COVID-19 pandemic  people were advised and even forced by governments to stay home and avoid social contact to slow down the spreading of the virus  The major LBG developers reacted by making in-game adjustments that allow playing from home  while still maintaining some incentives for players to go outdoors and socialise  For investigating factors influencing intention to play LBGs socially during the on-going pandemic  we collected cross-sectional survey data  N   855  from Finnish players of the most popular LBG  Pokemon GO  The results showed that perceived severity of the pandemic and a positive attitude towards both governmental measures and in-game changes for combatting COVID-19 predicted intention to reduce social playing  Fear of missing out and deficient self-regulation increased playing intensity  which in turn negatively correlated with the intention to reduce social playing  Our findings demonstrate the influence that LBGs can have on human behaviour even during global crises such as COVID-19  As such  LBGs can be considered a resource in designing interventions for influencing movement at a population level,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887611
2358,Human activities have been changing in conjunction with the status of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  with school closures and activity cancellations becoming commonplace  As such  the COVID-19 pandemic likely also has had a detrimental impact on the behavioral problems of children with neurodevelopmental disorders  NDD   In Japan  the government issued a stay-at-home order causing children to stop participating in school activities following the first declaration of a state of emergency  April 7 to May 25  2020   During winter 2020  the stay-at-home order and school closures were lifted  Using longitudinal data of children with NDD  we compared the behavioral problems of children with NDD between October 1 and December 31  2020  i e   winter 2020  with their behavioral problems before the COVID-19 pandemic  pre-COVID-19   In this study  143 caregivers of children with NDD evaluated their behavioral problems using the Japanese version of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist  ABC-J  in the pre-COVID-19 period and winter 2020  We found no scores that were higher in winter 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19  Moreover  irritability and hyperactivity scores were significantly lower in winter 2020 compared to pre-COVID-19  These findings suggest weak negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavioral problems of children with NDD  In schools and clinical practice  children learned knowledge about COVID-19 and related preventive behaviors  Therefore  these practices may have alleviated the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children with NDD,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966705
1195,In times of crisis  including the current COVID-19 pandemic  the supply chain of filtering facepiece respirators  such as N95 respirators  are disrupted  To combat shortages of N95 respirators  many institutions were forced to decontaminate and reuse respirators  While several reports have evaluated the impact on filtration as a measurement of preservation of respirator function after decontamination  the equally important fact of maintaining proper fit to the users  face has been understudied  In the current study  we demonstrate the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of fit test performance of N95 respirators following treatment with dry heat  We apply scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy  SEM EDS   X-ray diffraction  XRD  measurements  Raman spectroscopy  and contact angle measurements to analyze filter material changes as a consequence of different decontamination treatments  We further compared the integrity of the respirator after autoclaving versus dry heat treatment via quantitative fit testing and found that autoclaving  but not dry heat  causes the fit of the respirator onto the users face to fail  thereby rendering the decontaminated respirator unusable  Our findings highlight the importance to account for both efficacy of disinfection and mask fit when reprocessing respirators to for clinical redeployment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986162
528,BACKGROUND  People with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures  PNES  are at elevated risk of multiple psychiatric comorbidities  Current treatment gaps highlight the need for time-limited  distance-delivered interventions that can be cost-effectively delivered to patients with PNES  Project UPLIFT is a self-management program addressing mood problems in epilepsy that has not previously been adapted for PNES  The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of UPLIFT for patients with PNES  METHODS  Project UPLIFT was minimally adapted by a multidisciplinary research group at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center  Participants were recruited into a nonrandomized pilot study and were assessed at baseline  after completing the intervention  and at 1-month follow-up  RESULTS  The intervention was adapted and delivered without additional modification  A total of eight participants enrolled in the trial  and six participated in the first session  All six participants who started UPLIFT completed the intervention  with a 98  attendance record across the eight sessions  At follow-up  100  reported that UPLIFT provided useful tools for daily life  All participants continued using UPLIFT after completing the program  and 83  felt it helped with seizure management  Preliminary results provide proof-of-concept for future efficacy trials  CONCLUSION  This study provides initial support for the feasibility and acceptability of Project UPLIFT  minimally adapted for patients with PNES  As a time-limited program that can be distance-delivered to groups of patients  UPLIFT may be well-suited for the healthcare environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34999503
4541,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a primary respiratory infectious disease  which can result in pulmonary and cardiovascular complications  From its first appearance in the city of Wuhan  China   the infection spread worldwide  leading to its declaration as a pandemic on March 11  2020  Clinical research on SARS-CoV-2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  suggests that the virus may determine changes in the pulmonary hemodynamics through mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction  vascular leak  thrombotic microangiopathy  and venous thromboembolism that are similar to those leading to pulmonary hypertension  PH   Current available studies report echocardiographic signs of PH in approximately 12 to 13  of hospitalized patients with COVID-19  Those with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease  congestive heart failure  pulmonary embolism  and prior PH are at increased risk to develop or worsen PH  Evidence of PH seems to be associated with increased disease severity and poor outcome  Because of the importance of the pulmonary hemodynamics in the pathophysiology of COVID-19  there is growing interest in exploring the potential therapeutical benefits of inhaled vasodilators in patients with COVID-19  Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and prostacyclin has shown encouraging results through improvement of systemic oxygenation  reduction of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure  and prevention of right ventricular failure  however  data from randomized control trials are still required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933375
7346,INTRODUCTION  Jejunogastric intussusception following gastric surgery is a rare complication that  if not diagnosed early  can have catastrophic outcomes  PRESENTATION OF CASE  We have reported a case  never described previously  of an acute spontaneous retrograde JGI  presenting with obstruction and hematemesis  in a 70-year-old woman who has never  previously  undergone abdominal surgery  DISCUSSION  As in all cases of intestinal intussusception  early diagnosis is important for acute JGI as mortality rates increase from 10  when the intervention occurs within 48 h  to 50  if treatment is delayed for 96 h  The diagnosis of JGI can be determined with many imaging studies  such as endoscopy  ultrasonography  US   barium stadium and CT scan  Although JGI  up to now  has been described as a rare complication after any type of gastric surgery  this disease must  however  be suspected also in patients who have never undergone abdominal surgery  if they present with non-sedable abdominal pain associated with signs of high intestinal obstruction and hematemesis  CONCLUSION  Our hope is to add to the available literature to aid physicians in their diagnostic work-up and in developing management plans for similar cases occurring in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894594

1989,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is required for the cellular entry of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  ACE2  via the Ang- 1-7 -Mas-R axis  is part of the antihypertensive and cardioprotective effects of the renin-angiotensin system  We studied hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypertension and hypertensive human h  ACE2 transgenic mice to determine the outcome of COVID-19 with or without AT1 receptor  AT1R  blocker treatment  The severity of the illness and the levels of serum cardiac biomarkers  CK  CK-BM  cTnI   as well as the inflammation markers  IL-1  IL-6  CRP   were lesser in hypertensive COVID-19 patients treated with AT1R blockers than those treated with other antihypertensive drugs  Hypertensive hACE2 transgenic mice  pretreated with AT1R blocker  had increased ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney and heart  1 day post-infection  We conclude that those hypertensive patients treated with AT1R blocker may be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection  However  AT1R blockers had no effect on the severity of the illness but instead may have protected COVID-19 patients from heart injury  via the ACE2-angiotensin1-7-Mas receptor axis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973134
2508,Maintaining treatment fidelity when implementing evidence-based interventions is a significant challenge  The inability to deliver in-person services due to the COVID-19 pandemic critically challenged the foundation of implementation fidelity for home visiting programs across the globe  The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up  ABC  program is an evidence-based home visiting intervention designed to increase sensitivity in parents of infants who have experienced early adversity  ABC s community effectiveness is due to rigorous fidelity monitoring and supervision  Fidelity is measured by microanalytic coding of parenting opportunities and  in-the-moment  commenting  the active ingredient of ABC  In this study  we examined intervention fidelity among parent coaches implementing ABC through telehealth  Random 5-min clips from 510 telehealth ABC session videos conducted by 91 parent coaches at 48 agencies were coded for their frequency and quality of in-the-moment comments  On average  parent coaches were able to exceed in-person commenting fidelity standards when implementing ABC through the telehealth format  The active fidelity monitoring and supervision inherent to ABC s dissemination afforded a smooth transition to implementing ABC through telehealth while adhering to fidelity standards  Procedural and clinical challenges to telehealth implementation are discussed  along with future directions for telehealth program effectiveness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964152
2771,Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections is mostly based on the nasopharyngeal swabs  NPS   However  this collection is invasive and uncomfortable  especially for children and patients with coagulopathies  whose NPS collection often causes bleeding  Thus  the aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of saliva for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients presenting bleeding disorders  Samples of NPS  oropharyngeal swabs  OPS   and saliva were collected simultaneously from 1159 hospitalized patients with hematological diseases and from 524 healthcare workers  both symptomatic and asymptomatic for SARS-CoV-2  All samples were evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR  SARS-CoV-2 was detected in NPS  OPS and saliva from 16 9   14 4  and 15 6  individuals  respectively  Tests in saliva showed sensitivity  specificity  and overall agreement of 73 3   96 9  and 92 7    0 74   respectively  Salivary tests had good accuracy  AUC   0 7  for discriminating negative and positive qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2  Higher sensitivity was observed in symptomatic than in non-symptomatic patients  as well as in healthy subjects than in patients with hematological disease  in both OPS and saliva  The mean viral load in NPS was significantly higher than in OPS and in saliva samples  p < 0 001   Saliva is a good diagnostic tool to detect SARS-CoV-2  especially among patients symptomatic for COVID-19  and is a valuable specimen for mass screening of hospitalized patients with hematological diseases  especially for those that with bleeding disorders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960630

6718,Background  Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness  SPMI  have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than individuals without SPMI  In combination with physical distancing  hygiene protocols  and vaccines  quarantine and self-isolation are primary means of viral containment  However  individuals with SPMI may experience more difficulties with mandated quarantine or self-isolation because of their illness es   stigma  and marginalization  To date  there is a lack of consensus on strategies that could aid such individuals in completing isolation  Aim  This review aimed to synthesize evidence for interventions to support self-isolation and mandated quarantine for COVID-19 among individuals with SPMIs  Methods  We followed the PRISMA guidelines  searching 19 electronic databases  9 published literature registries and 10 gray literature sources   We looked for relevant randomized controlled trials  quasi-experimental studies  and program evaluations of the effectiveness of relevant psychosocial  pharmacological  harm reduction  and addiction management strategies to support isolation settings or quarantine requirements for individuals with any SPMI  e g   any mental disorder  substance use disorder  or their combination   Findings  Of 10 298 total records that were located  5582 were duplicate citations  Upon screening the remaining 4716 unique records by title and abstract  we excluded a further 3562 records  Only one original article met our inclusion criteria after reviewing the full texts of the remaining 1154 citations  To support individuals experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic  San Francisco developed an isolation hotel that reduced COVID-19 hospital strain for 1009 participants  25  had a mental health disorder and 26  had a substance use disorder   While 81  completed their hotel stay  48 patients had behavioral health needs that exceeded the hotel s capabilities  No other studies met our review s eligibility criteria  Most articles located by the search simply proposed solutions or discussed the challenges brought by COVID-19 for people with SPMIs  While some documents went a step further  e g   shelter guidance documents to support individuals experiencing homelessness   these rarely addressed individuals with SPMIs directly  Conclusions  This systematic review evaluated evidence from published and gray literature on interventions to support self-isolation and mandated COVID-19 quarantine for individuals with SPMIs  Only one study met our inclusion criteria  This study found a beneficial effect of a dedicated isolation hotel for individuals experiencing homelessness and COVID-19-where approximately 25 -50  of the study sample had a mental or substance use disorder  While there has been an abundance of COVID-19 protocols in general  information for SPMIs is lacking  As the pandemic continues and we better prepare for future pandemics  developing protocols for supporting SPMIs in this context is imperative,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901762
7890,The COVID-19 pandemic enforced countries to close schools and rapidly transfer to distance teaching without preparation  Little is known about how different distance teaching practices influenced students  wellbeing  We studied this during the period of school closures in Finland  Wellbeing was measured by health complaints and perceived loneliness  and distance learning was measured in terms of structure and dialogue of teaching  functioning of internet and digital equipment  difficulty of given tasks  and support for studies  All lower secondary schools were invited  and 29 898 students from 340 schools  grades 7-9  participated  A digital survey was distributed through schools just when these were reopened in May 2020  The main results were that the distance learning practices were related to adolescent health complaints and loneliness  so that less structure and dialogue in teaching  more problems with digital devices and internet  more difficult tasks and less support for studies were associated with higher health complaints and loneliness  From the point of view of students  wellbeing  it matters how the distance learning is organised  how digital communication works  and if enough support for studies is available  These results of our research on distance learning practices during the present pandemic may guide schools in future crises and pandemic situations when distance learning is needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886104
5225,BACKGROUND  Patients with autoimmune disease and on immunotherapy were largely excluded from seminal anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials  This has led to significant vaccine hesitancy in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases  NID   including  but not limited to  multiple sclerosis  MS   neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders  NMOSD   neurosarcoidosis and myelin oligodendrocyte antibody-mediated disease  MOG-AD   Data is urgently needed to help guide clinical care in the NID population  METHODS  This was a cross-sectional observational study evaluating adults with a neurologist-confirmed diagnosis of a neuroinflammatory disease  NID  and a neurologically asymptomatic control population  Participants were recruited from multiple academic centers participating in the MS Resilience to COVID-19 Collaborative study  We analyzed participant responses from a vaccine-specific questionnaire collected between February and May 2021  RESULTS  1164 participants with NID and 595 controls completed the vaccine survey  Hesitancy rates were similar between NID and control groups  n   134  32 7  NID vs  n   56  30 6  control  p   0 82   The most common reasons for hesitancy in NID participants were lack of testing in the autoimmune population and fear of demyelinating neurologic events  Unvaccinated patients who had discussed vaccination with their doctor were less likely to be hesitant  n 184  73 6  vs  n 83  59 7   p   0 007   634 NID patients and 332 controls had received at least one dose of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 at the time of survey completion  After adjusting for age  BMI  and comorbidities  there was no difference in self-reported side effects  SE  between groups with the first dose  n   256  42 2  NID vs  141  45 3  control  p   0 20  or second dose  n   246  67 0  NID vs  n   114  64 8  control  p   0 85  of the mRNA vaccines nor with the viral-vector vaccines  n   6  46  NID vs  n   8  66  control  p   0 39   All reported SEs fell into the expected SE profile  There was no difference in report of new recurrent neurologic symptoms  n   110  16 2  vaccinated vs  71  18 2  unvaccinated  p   0 44  nor radiologic disease activity  n   40  5 9  vaccinated vs  n   30  7 6  unvaccinated  between vaccinated and unvaccinated NID participants  CONCLUSIONS  We found no difference in patient-reported vaccine side effects and no evidence of NID worsening after vaccination  Large-scale real-world evidence is needed for further validation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923427
6410,Over just the last 2 years  mRNA therapeutics and vaccines have undergone a rapid transition from an intriguing concept to real-world impact  However  whereas some aspects of mRNA therapeutics  such as the use of chemical modifications to increase stability and reduce immunogenicity  have been extensively optimized for over two decades  other aspects  particularly the selection and design of the noncoding leader and trailer sequences which control translation efficiency and stability  have received comparably less attention  In practice  such 5  and 3  untranslated regions  UTRs  are often borrowed from highly expressed human genes with few or no modifications  as in the case for the Pfizer BioNTech Covid vaccine  Focusing on the 5 UTR  we here argue that model-driven design is a promising alternative that provides unprecedented control over 5 UTR function  We review recent work that combines synthetic biology with machine learning to build quantitative models that relate ribosome loading  and thus translation efficiency  to the 5 UTR sequence  We first introduce an experimental approach that uses polysome profiling and high-throughput sequencing to quantify ribosome loading for hundreds of thousands of 5 UTRs in parallel  We apply this approach to measure ribosome loading in synthetic RNA libraries with a random sequence inserted into the 5 UTR  We then review Optimus 5-Prime  a convolutional neural network model trained on the experimental data  We highlight that very accurate models of biological regulation can be learned from synthetic data sets with degenerate 5 UTRs  We validate model predictions not only on held-out data sets from our random library but also on a large library of over 30000 human 5 UTR fragments and using translation reporter data collected independently by other groups  Both the experiment and model are compatible with commonly used chemically modified nucleosides  in particular  pseudouridine  Psi  and 1-methyl-pseudouridine  m 1 Psi   We find that  in general  5 UTRs have very similar impacts when combined with different protein-coding sequences and even in the context of different chemical modifications  We demonstrate that Optimus 5-Prime can be combined with design algorithms to generate de novo sequences with precisely defined translation efficiencies  We emphasize recent developments in design algorithms that rely on activation maximization and generative modeling to improve both the fitness and diversity of designed sequences  Compared with prior approaches such as genetic algorithms  we show that these approaches are not only faster but also less likely to get stuck in local sequence optima  Finally  we discuss how the approach reviewed here can be generalized to other gene regions and applications,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905691
9405,COVID-19 transmission has been widespread across the California prison system  and at least two of these outbreaks were caused by transfer of infected individuals between prisons  Risks of individual prison outbreaks due to introduction of the virus and of widespread transmission within prisons due to poor conditions have been documented  We examine the additional risk potentially posed by transfer between prisons that can lead to large-scale spread of outbreaks across the prison system if the rate of transfer is sufficiently high  We estimated the threshold number of individuals transferred per prison per month to generate supercritical transmission between prisons  a condition that could lead to large-scale spread across the prison system  We obtained numerical estimates from a range of representative quantitative assumptions  and derived the percentage of transfers that must be performed with effective quarantine measures to prevent supercritical transmission given known rates of transfers occurring between California prisons  Our mean estimate of the critical threshold rate of transfers was 27 individuals transferred per prison per month  with standard deviation 26  in the absence of quarantine measures  Available data documents transfers occurring at a rate of 61 transfers per prison per month  At that rate  estimates of the threshold rate of adherence to quarantine precautions had mean 61   with standard deviation 32   While the impact of vaccination and possible decarceration measures is unclear  we include estimates of the above quantities given reductions in the probability and extent of outbreaks  We conclude that the risk of supercritical transmission between California prisons has been substantial  requiring quarantine protocols to be followed rigorously to manage this risk  The rate of outbreaks occurring in California prisons suggests that supercritical transmission may have occurred  We stress that the thresholds we estimate here do not define a safe level of transfers  even if supercritical transmission between prisons is avoided  since even low rates of transfer can cause very large outbreaks  We note that risks may persist after vaccination  due for example to variant strains  and in prison systems where widespread vaccination has not occurred  Decarceration remains urgently needed as a public health measure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861580
7999,Preventing transmission of COVID-19 between healthcare workers is essential to optimize patient  employee  and organizational outcomes  We used a systems engineering approach to analyze contact tracing interviews from a cluster of COVID-19 at our healthcare institution and identified modifiable and non-modifiable causes of transmission  Similar work system analyses may be useful to institutions in identifying multiple factors contributing to infection clusters among healthcare workers  and in developing layered infection prevention methods to further reduce transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883160
5764,Intraviral protein-protein interactions are crucial for replication  pathogenicity  and viral assembly  Among these  virus assembly is a critical step as it regulates the arrangements of viral structural proteins and helps in the encapsulation of genomic material  SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins play an essential role in the self-rearrangement  RNA encapsulation  and mature virus particle formation  In SARS-CoV  the membrane protein interacts with the envelope and spike protein in Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Complex  ERGIC  to form an assembly in the lipid bilayer  followed by membrane-ribonucleoprotein  nucleocapsid  interaction  In this study  we tried to understand the interaction of membrane protein s interaction with envelope  spike  and nucleocapsid proteins using protein-protein docking  Further  simulation studies were performed up to 100 ns to examine the stability of protein-protein complexes of Membrane-Envelope  Membrane-Spike  and Membrane-Nucleocapsid proteins  Prime MM-GBSA showed high binding energy calculations for the simulated structures than the docked complex  The interactions identified in our study will be of great importance  as it provides valuable insight into the protein-protein complex  which could be the potential drug targets for future studies Communicated by Ramaswamy H  Sarma,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913847
7161,This article aimed to explore issues of concern related to quarantine  its social consequences and influences  challenging its effects on human behavioral expressions during social isolation  The advent of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic impacted human lives in multifarious ways  threatening the meaning of normalcy  Quarantine  lockdown  isolation  and other terms reflecting conditions limiting human freedoms have become synonymous in importance to safety  security  and survival  To understand human defiance in the face of maintaining limited mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic  reimagining situations of  unfreedoms  is explained as thinking of changes to inspire and improve the meaning of living lives meaningfully  During the pandemic  issues regarding healthcare practices and social behaviors focused much attention on interactive challenges that enhance ways to mitigate the spread of contagious diseases  Illuminating these issues  discussing concerns and highlighting recommendations to engage in alternative approaches and practices  heightens the declaration of efficiency of quarantine outcomes and effectiveness  Implications are proposed with the hope that they may lead the way forward in exercising contemporary healthcare practices,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897884
2063,This paper presents a novel Lasso Logistic Regression model based on feature-based time series data to determine disease severity and when to administer drugs or escalate intervention procedures in patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Advanced features were extracted from highly enriched and time series vital sign data of hospitalized COVID-19 patients  including oxygen saturation readings  and with a combination of patient demographic and comorbidity information  as inputs into the dynamic feature-based classification model  Such dynamic combinations brought deep insights to guide clinical decision-making of complex COVID-19 cases  including prognosis prediction  timing of drug administration  admission to intensive care units  and application of intervention procedures like ventilation and intubation  The COVID-19 patient classification model was developed utilizing 900 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a leading multi-hospital system in Texas  United States  By providing mortality prediction based on time-series physiologic data  demographics  and clinical records of individual COVID-19 patients  the dynamic feature-based classification model can be used to improve efficacy of the COVID-19 patient treatment  prioritize medical resources  and reduce casualties  The uniqueness of our model is that it is based on just the first 24 hours of vital sign data such that clinical interventions can be decided early and applied effectively  Such a strategy could be extended to prioritize resource allocations and drug treatment for future pandemic events,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34971548
7644,BACKGROUND  Two mRNA vaccines  Pfizer-BNT162b2 and Moderna-mRNA-1273  obtained the Emergency Use Listing by WHO for preventing COVID-19  However  little is known about the difference in antibody responses induced by these two mRNA vaccines in naive and previously infected  PI  individuals  METHOD  We investigated the levels of anti-S-RBD  total  IgG and IgA  levels in naive and PI individuals  1-13  median   6  weeks following the second dose of either vaccine  Results in the naive-vaccinated group  the mRNA-1273 vaccine induced significantly higher levels of anti-S-RBD total antibodies  3 5-fold  P < 0 001   IgG  2-fold  P < 0 01  and IgA  2 1-fold  P < 0 001  as compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine  In addition  both vaccines produced significantly higher anti-S-RBD total antibody levels in the PI-group compared with naive-vaccinated group  The PI group elicited a higher level of anti-S-RBD IgG than the naive-BNT162b2  P   0 05   but not more than the naive-mRNA-1273  P   0 9  group  Interestingly  the PI vaccinated group elicited a comparable level of IgA ratio to the naive-mRNA-1273 group but significantly higher than the naive-BNT162b2 group  1 6-fold  P < 0 001   CONCLUSION  Our results showed that the PI-vaccinated group produces a higher level of antibodies than the naive vaccinated group  particularly for those vaccinated with BNT162b2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888670
4001,DNA is recognized as a powerful biomarker for clinical diagnostics because its specific sequences are closely related to the cause and development of diseases  However  achieving rapid  low-cost  and sensitive detection of short-length target DNA still remains a considerable challenge  Herein  we successfully combine the catalytic hairpin assembly  CHA  technique with capillary action to develop a new and cost-effective method  a target DNA- and pH-responsive DNA hydrogel-based capillary assay  for the naked eye detection of 24 nt short single-stranded target DNA  Upon contact of target DNA  three individual hairpin DNAs hybridize with each other to sufficiently amplify Y-shaped DNA nanostructures  Y-DNA  until they are completely consumed via CHA cycling reactions  Each arm of the resultant Y-DNA contains sticky ends with i-motif DNA structure-forming sequences that can be self-assembled in an acidic environment  pH 5 0  to form target DNA- and pH-responsive DNA hydrogels by means of i-motif DNA-driven crosslinking  When inserting a capillary tube in the resultant solution  the liquid level inside clearly reduces due to the decrease in capillary force induced by the gels  In this way  the developed assay demonstrates sensitive and quantitative detection  with a detection limit of approximately 10 pM of 24 nt short complementary DNA  cDNA  targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA genes at room temperature within 1 h  The assay is further shown to successfully detect target cDNA in serum  and it is also applied to detect several types of target sequences  Requiring no analytic equipment  precise temperature control  or enzymatic reactions  the developed DNA hydrogel-based capillary assay has potential as a promising naked eye detection platform for target DNA in resource-limited clinical settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940928
6045,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has highlighted the need for the timely collection and sharing of public health data  It is important that data sharing is balanced with protecting confidentiality  Here we discuss an innovative mechanism to protect health data  called differential privacy  Differential privacy is a mathematically rigorous definition of privacy that aims to protect against all possible adversaries  In layperson s terms  statistical noise is applied to the data so that overall patterns can be described  but data on individuals are unlikely to be extracted  One of the first use cases for health data in Australia is the development of the COVID-19 Real-Time Information System for Preparedness and Epidemic Response  CRISPER   which provides proof of concept for the use of this technology in the health sector  If successful  this will benefit future sharing of public health data,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909703
1703,The coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19  infection requires major efforts in healthcare systems  due to the high risk of mortality  particularly in subjects with significant comorbidity  >   2 pathologies  and polypharmacy  >   5 drugs   The treatment of COVID-19 needs a careful evaluation  to reduce the risk of potentially adverse drug reactions  The aim of the study was to examine the use of computerized prescription support in the management and treatment of the COVID-19 infection  We evaluated n 33 patients  51  females  admitted to the west COVID Low-Medium Intensity of Care of Sant Andrea Hospital during the period March-April 2020 and n 42 subjects  50  females  admitted to the Internal Medicine ward  as control group   by INTERCheck R  and Drug-PIN R   The comorbidity  n  pathologies   polypharmacy  n  drugs   and total INTERCheck score in COVID-19 patients and controls were  respectively  mean   - standard deviation   5 8   - 3 8  7 9   - 4 5  and 9 2   - 7 1 and 6 8   - 2 6  8 0   - 2 6  and 4 9   - 3 8  statistically significant for comorbidity p < 0 01 and INTERCheck score p < 0 01   The correlation between the scores obtained by the INTERCheck and Drug-PIN software was statistically significant  either at admission  p < 0 0000001  or during hospitalization  p < 0 00000001   Both the computerized prescription support systems  INTERCheck R  and Drug-PIN R   are useful to better characterize the patients and to ameliorate the drugs prescriptions in COVID-19 infection  with particular attention to the elderly population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977463
2631,COVID-19 has been a global threat since November 2019 due to its high transmission rates and the issue of unwillingness to vaccinate  Effective risk management requires accurate health communication and public compliance with reccomended preventive behaviors  Therefore  we investigated predictors of COVID-19 preventive behavior intention based on Protection Motivation Theory  PMT  in addition to frequency of public s use of and trust in a group of COVID-19 related information sources  This cross-sectional study was conducted on 458 adults in Turkey with online survey  Results showed that all PMT components  except perceived susceptibility  accounted for 49  of the variance in protection motivation and there was relationship between information sources and protection motivation  Overall  our study findings suggested that being more informed and having confidence in the feasibility  self-efficacy  and effectiveness  response efficacy  of preventive behaviors may particularly help slow the disease spread,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962187

4609,OBJECTIVE  The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted young adults with an unprecedented mental health challenge  Yet  prospective studies examining protective factors are limited  METHODS  In the present study  we focused on changes in mental health in a large sample  N   685  of at-risk university students  which were measured before and during the pandemic  Network modeling was applied to 20 measured variables to explore intercorrelations between mental health factors  and to identify risk and protective factors  Latent change score modeling was used on a subset of variables  RESULTS  The main findings indicate that  1  mental health problems increased at group level  especially depression-anxiety and loneliness   2  emotional support during the COVID pandemic was associated with smaller increases in loneliness and depression-anxiety   3  COVID-related stress predicted increases in depression-anxiety   4  loneliness acted as a bridge construct between emotional support and changes in mental health  CONCLUSION  To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults  is it recommended to focus on interventions that strengthen internal resources  stress-regulating abilities  and reduce loneliness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932250
2867,The COVID-19 pandemic is changing rapidly and requires different strategies to maintain immunization  In Korea  different COVID-19 vaccines are recommended and available for various populations  including healthcare workers  HCWs  at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection  We plan to evaluate the adverse events  AEs  and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines in HCWs at a single center  This cohort study included HCWs fully vaccinated with either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1  Blood samples were taken eight weeks after the second vaccination with both COVID-19 vaccines and six months after the second vaccination from participants with the BNT162b2 vaccine  The primary endpoint for immunogenicity was the serum neutralizing antibody responses eight weeks after vaccination  The secondary endpoint was the incidence of various AEs within 28 days of each vaccination  Between 16 March and 23 June 2021  115 participants were enrolled  65 in the ChAdOx1 group and 50 in the BNT162b2 group   Significantly higher surrogate virus neutralization test  sVNT  inhibition was observed in participants vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2  mean  SD  91 4  9 68    than in those vaccinated with ChAdOx1  mean  SD  73 3  22 57     The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine was maintained across all age and gender categories  At six months after the second dose  serum antibody levels declined significantly in the BNT162b2 group  The main adverse events  including fever  myalgia  fatigue  and headache  were significantly higher in the ChAdOx1 group after the first dose  whereas  after the second dose  those AEs were significantly higher in the BNT162b2 group  p < 0 05   Two doses of either the ChAdOx1 or the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine resulted in very high seropositivity among the HCWs at our center  The quality of the antibody response  measured by sVNT inhibition  was significantly better with the BNT162b2 vaccine than with the ChAdOx1 vaccine  There was no significant association between neutralizing antibody response and AE after each vaccination in our cohort,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960125
4827,OBJECTIVES  To exploit the features of digital PCR for implementing SARS-CoV-2 observational studies by reliably including the viral load factor expressed as copies muL  METHODS  A small cohort of 51 Covid-19 positive samples was assessed by both RT-qPCR and digital PCR assays  A linear regression model was built using a training subset  and its accuracy was assessed in the remaining evaluation subset  The model was then used to convert the stored cycle threshold values of a large dataset of 6208 diagnostic samples into copies muL of SARS-CoV-2  The calculated viral load was used for a single cohort retrospective study  Finally  the cohort was randomly divided into a training set  n   3095  and an evaluation set  n   3113  to establish a logistic regression model for predicting case-fatality and to assess its accuracy  RESULTS  The model for converting the Ct values into copies muL was suitably accurate  The calculated viral load over time in the cohort of Covid-19 positive samples showed very low viral loads during the summer inter-epidemic waves in Italy  The calculated viral load along with gender and age allowed building a predictive model of case-fatality probability which showed high specificity  99 0   and low sensitivity  21 7   at the optimal threshold which varied by modifying the threshold  i e  75  sensitivity and 83 7  specificity   Alternative models including categorised cVL or raw cycle thresholds obtained by the same diagnostic method also gave the same performance  CONCLUSION  The modelling of the cycle threshold values using digital PCR had the potential of fostering studies addressing issues regarding Sars-CoV-2  furthermore  it may allow setting up predictive tools capable of early identifying those patients at high risk of case-fatality already at diagnosis  irrespective of the diagnostic RT-qPCR platform in use  Depending upon the epidemiological situation  public health authority policies aims  the resources available and the thresholds used  adequate sensitivity could be achieved with acceptable low specificity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928966
9543,Background and Aims  The impact of COVID-19 has been of great concern in patients with inflammatory bowel disease  IBD  worldwide  including an increased risk of severe outcomes and or possible flare of IBD  This study aims to evaluate prevalence  outcomes  the impact of COVID-19 in patients with IBD  and risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 or flare of IBD activity  Methods  A consecutive cohort of IBD patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and followed up at the McGill University Health Care Centre was obtained between March 1  2020  and April 30  2021  Demographics  comorbidities  IBD  type  treatments  pre- and post-COVID-19 clinical activity  biomarkers  and endoscopic activity   and COVID-19-related outcomes  pneumonia  hospitalization  death  and flare of IBD disease  were analyzed  Results  A cohort of 3 516 IBD patients was included  82 patients  2 3   were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection  median age  39 0  IQR 27 8-48 0   77  with Crohn s disease  50  were female   The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in IBD patients was significantly lower compared to the general population in Canada and Quebec  3 5  versus 4 3   p < 0 001   Severe COVID-19 occurred in 6 patients  7 3    2 patients  2 4   died  A flare of IBD post-COVID-19 infection was reported in 8 patients  9 8   within 3 months  Biologic therapy was held during active COVID-19 infection in 37  of patients  Age >  55 years  odds ratio  OR   11 1  95  CI  1 8-68 0   systemic corticosteroid use  OR  4 6  95  CI  0 7-30 1   active IBD  OR  3 8  95  CI  0 7-20 8   and comorbidity  OR  4 9  95  CI  0 8-28 6  were factors associated with severe COVID-19  After initial infection  61  of IBD patients received COVID-19 vaccinations  Conclusion  The prevalence of COVID-19 infection among patients with IBD was lower than that in the general population in Canada  Severe COVID-19  mortality  and flare of IBD were relatively rare  while a large proportion of patients received COVID-19 vaccination  Older age  comorbidities  active IBD disease  and systemic corticosteroid  but not immunosuppressive or biological therapy  were associated with severe COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858891

1665,The reliance on data donation from citizens as a driver for research  known as citizen science  has accelerated during the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic  An important enabler of this is Internet of Things  IoT  devices  such as mobile phones and wearable devices  that allow continuous data collection and convenient sharing  However  potentially sensitive health data raises privacy and security concerns for citizens  which research institutions and industries must consider  In e-commerce or social network studies of citizen science  a privacy calculus related to user perceptions is commonly developed  capturing the information disclosure intent of the participants  In this study  we develop a privacy calculus model adapted for IoT-based health research using citizen science for user engagement and data collection  Based on an online survey with 85 participants  we make use of the privacy calculus to analyse the respondents  perceptions  The emerging privacy personas are clustered and compared with previous research  resulting in three distinct personas which can be used by designers and technologists who are responsible for developing suitable forms of data collection  These are the 1  Citizen Science Optimist  the 2  Selective Data Donor  and the 3  Health Data Controller  Together with our privacy calculus for citizen science based digital health research  the three privacy personas are the main contributions of this study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977856
2997,Background Growing concerns about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  will likely lead to increased mental health diagnoses and treatment  To provide a pre-COVID-19 baseline  we have examined antidepressant prescribing trends for 5 years preceding COVID-19  Methods A retrospective analysis of anonymised data on medicines prescribed by GPs in England from the Open-Prescribing Database  January 2015 to December 2019  identified the 10 most prescribed antidepressant and  for comparison  cardiovascular medicines  Results Prescription items for the 10 most prescribed antidepressants rose 25  from 58 million  2015  to 72 million  2019   Citalopram was the most prescribed antidepressant  prescriptions for sertraline rose fastest at 2 million items year on year  Over the same period  costs for antidepressant prescribing fell 27 8   Across all Clinical Commissioning Groups  CCGs  in England  antidepressant prescribing levels  adjusted for population were positively correlated with the index of multiple deprivation  IMD  score  In comparison  prescribing for the top 10 most prescribed cardiovascular medicines increased by 2 75  from 207 million  2015  to 213 million  2019  items  Limitations Anonymised data in the Open-Prescribing Database means no patient diagnoses or treatment plans are linked to this data  Conclusion Antidepressant prescribing  particularly sertraline  is increasing  Prescribing is higher in more deprived regions  but costs are falling to < 2  of all items prescribed  Absolute numbers of prescriptions for cardiovascular medicines are higher  likely reflecting the greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease  and are rising more slowly  This study will enable future work to look at the impact of COVID-19 on prescribing for mental health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957433
8159,Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour  and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources  Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias  an instance of the Big Data Paradox 1   Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys  Delphi-Facebook 2 3   about 250 000 responses per week  and Census Household Pulse 4   about 75 000 every two weeks   In May 2021  Delphi-Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points  14-20 percentage points with 5  benchmark imprecision  and Census Household Pulse by 14  11-17 percentage points with 5  benchmark imprecision   compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021  Moreover  their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates  By contrast  an Axios-Ipsos online panel 5  with about 1 000 responses per week following survey research best practices 6  provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification  We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework 1  to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys  We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness  We show how a survey of 250 000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10  Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity  and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880504
8539,The complement system  as a vital part of innate immunity  has an important role in the clearance of pathogens  however  unregulated activation of this system probably has a key role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury  which is induced by highly pathogenic viruses  i e  influenza A viruses and severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  coronavirus   The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  which is the causal agent for the ongoing global pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019  Covid-19   has recently been spread to almost all countries around the world  Although most people are immunocompetent to SARS-CoV-2  a small group develops hyper-inflammation that leads to complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome  disseminated intravascular coagulation  and multi-organ failure  Emerging evidence demonstrates that the complement system exerts a crucial role in this inflammatory reaction  Additionally  patients with the severe form of Covid-19 show over-activation of the complement in their skin  sera  and lungs  This study aims to summarise current knowledge concerning the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the complement system and to critically appraise complement inhibition as a potential new approach for Covid-19 treatment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873779

1744,As of November 17  2021  SARS-CoV-2  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2   the causative agent of COVID-19  COronaVIrus Disease 19   has infected  250 million people worldwide  causing around five million deaths  Titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were relatively stable for at least 9 months in a population-based study conducted in Wuhan  China  both in symptomatic and in asymptomatic individuals  In the mass screening campaign conducted in the town of Ariano Irpino  Avellino  Italy  in May  2020  5 7   95  CI  5 3-6-1  of the 13 444 asymptomatic citizens screened were positive for anti-nucleocapsid antibodies against SARS-CoV-2  Among these  422 citizens were re-tested for anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in January  2021 and or in April  2021 and enrolled in this longitudinal observational study  Median  interquartile range  age of the study cohort was 46 years  29-59   with 47  11 1   participants of minor age  while 217  51 4   participants were females  There was no evidence of re-infection in any of the subjects included  Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies antibodies  Elecysis  Roche  was reported in 95 7 and 93 7  of evaluable participants in January and April  2021  Multiple logistic regression analysis used to explore associations between age  sex and seroprevalence showed that adults vs  minors had significantly lower odds of having anti-S1 antibodies  Biorad  both in January  2021 and in April  2021  Our findings showed that antibodies remained detectable at least 11 5 months after infection in >90  of never symptomatic cases  Further investigation is required to establish duration of immunity against SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976939
3542,Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele  APOE4  has been shown to associate with increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality in some previous genetic studies  but information on the role of APOE4 on the underlying pathology and parallel clinical manifestations is scarce  Here we studied the genetic association between APOE and COVID-19 in Finnish biobank  autopsy and prospective clinical cohort datasets  In line with previous work  our data on 2611 cases showed that APOE4 carriership associates with severe COVID-19 in intensive care patients compared with non-infected population controls after matching for age  sex and cardiovascular disease status  Histopathological examination of brain autopsy material of 21 COVID-19 cases provided evidence that perivascular microhaemorrhages are more prevalent in APOE4 carriers  Finally  our analysis of post-COVID fatigue in a prospective clinical cohort of 156 subjects revealed that APOE4 carriership independently associates with higher mental fatigue compared to non-carriers at six months after initial illness  In conclusion  the present data on Finns suggests that APOE4 is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and post-COVID mental fatigue and provides the first indication that some of this effect could be mediated via increased cerebrovascular damage  Further studies in larger cohorts and animal models are warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34949230
4514,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased demand for health care resources and  in some cases  shortage of medical equipment and staff  Our objective was to develop and validate a multivariable model to predict risk of hospitalization for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2  METHODS  We used routinely collected health records in a patient cohort to develop and validate our prediction model  This cohort included adult patients  age >   18 yr  from Ontario  Canada  who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction between Feb  2 and Oct  5  2020  and were followed up through Nov  5  2020  Patients living in long-term care facilities were excluded  as they were all assumed to be at high risk of hospitalization for COVID-19  Risk of hospitalization within 30 days of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was estimated via gradient-boosting decision trees  and variable importance examined via Shapley values  We built a gradient-boosting model using the Extreme Gradient Boosting  XGBoost  algorithm and compared its performance against 4 empirical rules commonly used for risk stratifications based on age and number of comorbidities  RESULTS  The cohort included 36 323 patients with 2583 hospitalizations  7 1    Hospitalized patients had a higher median age  64 yr v  43 yr   were more likely to be male  56 3  v  47 3   and had a higher median number of comorbidities  3  interquartile range  IQR  2-6 v  1  IQR 0-3  than nonhospitalized patients  Patients were split into development  n   29 058  80 0   and held-out validation  n   7265  20 0   cohorts  The gradient-boosting model achieved high discrimination  development cohort  area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the 5 folds of 0 852  validation cohort  0 8475  and strong calibration  slope   1 01  intercept   -0 01   The patients who scored at the top 10  captured 47 4  of hospitalizations  and those who scored at the top 30  captured 80 6   INTERPRETATION  We developed and validated an accurate risk stratification model using routinely collected health administrative data  We envision that modelling such risk stratification based on routinely collected health data could support management of COVID-19 on a population health level,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933880

7949,BACKGROUND AND AIMS  SARS-CoV-2-infected patients can experience long-lasting symptoms even after the resolution of the acute infection  This condition  defined as Long COVID  is now recognized as a public health priority and its negative impact on the quality of life of the patients could be more relevant in individuals with debilitating pathologies  We here evaluated the frequency of Long COVID in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases  IBD   METHODS  IBD patients afferent for scheduled visits to our tertiary referral center at the Tor Vergata University Hospital  Rome  were recruited from 7 September to 22 October 2021  During the visits  patients were investigated about previous COVID-19 infection and the possible development of Long COVID  RESULTS  Fifty-three out of 528 IBD patients  10   have had a SARS-CoV-2 infection  Of these  21 patients  40   developed Long COVID  and asthenia was the more frequent symptom as it occurred in nearly two-thirds of patients  Patients with Long COVID were more frequently females  while other clinical and demographic characteristics did not differ between patients with Long COVID and those without Long COVID  In particular  the IBD relapses occurred with the same frequency in the two groups  CONCLUSIONS  Long COVID appears to be common in IBD patients even though it does not influence the IBD course,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884276
8773,Background  COVID-19 is a pandemic respiratory and vascular disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus  There is a growing number of sensory deficits associated with COVID-19 and molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are incompletely understood  Methods  We report a series of ten COVID-19 patients with audiovestibular symptoms such as hearing loss  vestibular dysfunction and tinnitus  To investigate the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and audiovestibular dysfunction  we examine human inner ear tissue  human inner ear in vitro cellular models  and mouse inner ear tissue  Results  We demonstrate that adult human inner ear tissue co-expresses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus  and the transmembrane protease serine 2  TMPRSS2  and FURIN cofactors required for virus entry  Furthermore  hair cells and Schwann cells in explanted human vestibular tissue can be infected by SARS-CoV-2  as demonstrated by confocal microscopy  We establish three human induced pluripotent stem cell  hiPSC -derived in vitro models of the inner ear for infection  two-dimensional otic prosensory cells  OPCs  and Schwann cell precursors  SCPs   and three-dimensional inner ear organoids  Both OPCs and SCPs express ACE2  TMPRSS2  and FURIN  with lower ACE2 and FURIN expression in SCPs  OPCs are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection  lower infection rates exist in isogenic SCPs  The inner ear organoids show that hair cells express ACE2 and are targets for SARS-CoV-2  Conclusions  Our results provide mechanistic explanations of audiovestibular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and introduce hiPSC-derived systems for studying infectious human otologic disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870285
5156,Objective To evaluate the change in the prevalence of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among internists and primary care physicians in Japan  and to identify factors associated with the exacerbation of burnout among these populations during this period  Methods This was a cross-sectional study based on two web-based surveys conducted in January 2020  before the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic  and June 2020  during the pandemic   The participants were internists and primary care physicians of the Japanese Chapter of the American College of Physicians  The main outcome was the change in the prevalence of burnout between before and during the  first wave  of the pandemic  We also examined factors associated with the exacerbation of burnout during this period  Results Among the 283 respondents in the first survey and 322 in the second survey  98  34 6   and 111  34 5   reported symptoms of burnout  respectively  In June 2020  82 respondents  25 5   reported that their level of burnout exacerbated compared to January 2020  Only the experience of self-quarantine was associated with the exacerbation of burnout  odds ratio  OR  3 12  95  confidence interval  CI  1 49-6 50  P 0 002   while being a woman  being a resident physician  and an experience of having worked in a prefecture under a state of emergency were not  Conclusions No marked change in the prevalence of burnout among internists and primary care physicians in Japan was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic as a whole  However  self-quarantine was associated with the exacerbation of the burnout level,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924459
8460,BACKGROUND  We examined the implementation of a brief  behavioural activation  BA  model  via telemedicine  for perinatal populations during a confluence of significant global events in 2020  We conducted a rigorous qualitative study to identify relevant barriers and facilitators from the perspectives of both perinatal participants and treatment providers  We also present two case studies where BA was used and adapted to provide patient-centered care  METHODS  Within the ongoing SUMMIT non-inferiority randomized controlled trial in Canada and USA  we interviewed a random selection of perinatal participants  n   23  and all treatment providers  n   28   A content analysis framework was developed to identify relevant barriers and facilitators and frequencies were calculated for each emergent theme within and across respondent groups  RESULTS  Key facilitators reported by participants receiving BA were that BA helped with support and social connection  73 9    creative problem solving  26 1   and attending to pandemic-related symptoms  21 7    Key facilitators endorsed by providers delivering BA were the use of telemedicine  35 7   and loosening of government restrictions  21 4    Both participant groups reported similar barriers to BA during the pandemic such as a lack of privacy and limited activities due to pandemic restrictions  However  providers were more likely to endorse pandemic-related life stressors as a barrier to treatment delivery compared to participants  64 3  vs  34 8    Both participant groups experienced explicit discussion of race and the racial justice movements during sessions as beneficial and reported harms of not doing so to the therapeutic alliance  CONCLUSIONS  BA offers a person-centered model to facilitate social connection through creative problem-solving for women with perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  Explicit discussion of race and racial injustice during sessions is an important and helpful aspect in psychological treatments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875282
6666,Drawing on the tenets of family stress theory  the aim of this study is to examine parents  perceived stress  symptoms of anxiety  depression  and associated risk- and protective factors across demographic subgroups during in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  Norwegian parents  N   2868  79 5  mothers  with >1 child under 18 years of age completed an online survey two weeks after the implementation of government-initiated distancing measures  The survey includes measures of COVID-related risk factors  parental stress  burnout  depression  anxiety  anger of parents towards children  difficulty working from home  and positive beliefs about worry  and protective factors  self-efficacy and social support   Mothers  parents living with more than one child  and parents with a psychiatric diagnosis reported greater levels of parental stress  more burnout  and more anger towards their children  as well as less social support  Almost 25  of the parents reported anxiety and depression that are clinically significant  Parents who followed distancing measures reported significantly higher distress  Anger of parents towards children explains 41  of the variation in parental stress  These findings indicate that parents have experienced symptoms of deteriorated mental health due to the COVID- 19 pandemic  including parental stress  anxiety  and depression  The study presents practical implications for meso- and macro-level policymaking and offers support to further the potential aims of public health and clinical interventions  Future studies to monitor long-term aversive mental health outcomes among parents are warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902219
7533,PURPOSE  The main objective of this study was to gain insight into school-based speech-language pathologists   SLPs   perspectives on and experiences with telepractice as a service delivery model at the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic  A better understanding of the facilitating and challenging factors that belie telepractice-based services will guide the creation of training and resource development to further support remote speech-language services in schools  METHOD  Four focus group sessions using a semistructured format were conducted with 22 school-based SLPs from 14 states in the United States  The focus groups provided an opportunity for SLPs to reflect on their telepractice experiences  including pros and cons  necessary knowledge and skills  factors impacting telepractice service delivery  and student and family participation  Inductive thematic analysis was used to describe the collective experiences and perspectives of the participants  RESULTS  Three themes regarding telepractice emerged  technology use  locus of control for decision making  and student and family engagement  Participants reported experiencing a range of successes and challenges when attempting to meet students  needs and identified gaps in resources and school capacity for telepractice  CONCLUSIONS  The findings revealed how school SLPs experienced telepractice service delivery during the remote learning portion of the 2019-2020 school year due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic  The study increases our understanding of factors that facilitated and challenged the effective delivery of speech-language services via telepractice  To assist SLPs in future telepractice efforts  implications for professional development and further research are provided,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34890218
9162,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has emerged as a global pandemic until today  but treatment options remain limited  COVID-19 vaccination is expected to decrease the number of patients with COVID-19 worldwide  In Japan  two types of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine  BNT162b2  Pfizer BioNTech  and mRNA-1273  Moderna   have been approved and administered  However  their side effects remain poorly elucidated  This paper presents two cases of immune thrombocytopenia  ITP  after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination  Whether or not ITP is triggered by the vaccination or not is difficult to identify  Further investigation with a large number of cases is warranted to clarify the side effects of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866090
4901,Vitamin-D receptors are found in a variety of cells with the potential to regulate many cellular functions  Higher COVID-19 severity has been reported in individuals  which are known to have lower vitamin-D levels  The relation between vitamin-D and COVID-19 has been analysed with a number of studies but only few met high standards  Studies revealed discordant findings  There is no data from interventional trials clearly indicating that vitamin-D supplementation may prevent against COVID-19  An increasing number of observational studies put forward the preventive feature of adequate vitamin-D status for COVID-19 mortality  Yet  there are again conflicting findings  This narrative review summarizes the current evidence and provides a practical advice to lessen the impact of COVID-19 by ensuring recommended vitamin-D intakes  This approach would not be harmful  but potentially useful  Vitamin-D is safe especially if it does not exceed the upper-tolerable-limit  Daily doses are recommended over the weekly or monthly higher doses  Mega-doses are not recommended because of its potential to lead adverse events  The target level of vitamin-D is proposed above 30 ng mL in majority of the studies  Nonetheless  one should consider that the benefit is foreseen to be small  and some time  months  may be needed for such effect,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927562
6682,The recent global spread of COVID-19 stresses the importance of developing diagnostic testing that is rapid and does not require specialized laboratories  In this regard  nanomaterial thin-film-based immunosensors fabricated via solution processing are promising  potentially due to their mass manufacturability  on-site detection  and high sensitivity that enable direct detection of virus without the need for molecular amplification  However  thus far  thin-film-based biosensors have been fabricated without properly analyzing how the thin-film properties are correlated with the biosensor performance  limiting the understanding of property-performance relationships and the optimization process  Herein  the correlations between various thin-film properties and the sensitivity of carbon nanotube thin-film-based immunosensors are systematically analyzed  through which optimal sensitivity is attained  Sensitivities toward SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in buffer solution and in the lysed virus are 0 024  fg mL  -1  and 0 048  copies mL  -1   respectively  which are sufficient for diagnosing patients in the early stages of COVID-19  The technique  therefore  can potentially elucidate complex relationships between properties and performance of biosensors  thereby enabling systematic optimization to further advance the applicability of biosensors for accurate and rapid point-of-care  POC  diagnosis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901932
6094,Introduction  Community mitigation strategies  CMS  have demonstrated to be effective in the reduction of transmission and incidence of COVID-19  especially in the population with symptoms associated with the disease  The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and adherence to CMS in Latin American adults  Methods  We carried out a secondary analysis of a database developed by the University of Maryland and Facebook social network during the COVID-19 pandemic  We included Latin American adults that used the Facebook platform and participated in a survey conducted from April 23 to May 23  2020  The principal outcome variable was reported compliance with the three main CMS  physical distancing  use of face masks  and hand washing   The exposure variable included symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 defined as the presence of three or more symptoms of an acute clinical case of COVID-19  We performed generalized linear models of the Poisson family with a logarithmic link function to evaluate the association between the presence of COVID-19 symptoms and reported compliance with CMS  We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios  PR  with their 95  confidence intervals  95 CI   Results  We analyzed 1 310 690 adults from Latin America  48 1  were male and 42 9  were under 35 years of age  The prevalence of suspicious symptoms of COVID-19 was 18 5  and reported compliance with the three CMS was 45 3   The countries with the highest proportion of reported compliance with the three CMS were Peru  Bolivia and Panama  while those with the lowest reported compliance were Costa Rica  Nicaragua and Honduras  In the adjusted model  people with suspicious symptoms for COVID-19 had a 14  lower compliance with the three CMS  aPR   0 86  95 CI  0 85-0 87  p < 0 001   Conclusions  Less than half of the participants complied with the CMS  and those presenting suspicious symptoms for COVID-19 had lower reported compliance with the three CMS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909370
4562,Due to its high lethality among older people  the safety of nursing homes has been of central importance during the COVID-19 pandemic  With test procedures and vaccines becoming available at scale  nursing homes might relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections  By control we mean that each index case infects less than one other person on average  Here  we develop an agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 calibrated to Austrian nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies  We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends critically on test turnover time  time until test result   the detection threshold of tests and mitigation testing frequencies  Under realistic conditions and in absence of vaccinations  we find that mitigation testing of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks if tests have low turnover times and detection thresholds  If vaccines that are 60  effective against high viral load and transmission are available  control is achieved if 80  or more of the residents are vaccinated  even without mitigation testing and if residents are allowed to have visitors  Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy against infection  retention of testing infrastructures  regular testing and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932931
7846,Epidemic spreading causes severe challenges to the global public health system  and global and local interventions are considered an effective way to contain such spreading  including school closures  local   border control  global   etc  However  there is little study on comparing the efficiency of global and local interventions on epidemic spreading  Here  we develop a new model based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered  SEIR  model with an additional compartment called  quarantine status   We simulate various kinds of outbreaks and interventions  Firstly  we predict  consistent with previous studies  interventions reduce epidemic spreading to 16  of its normal level  Moreover  we compare the effect of global and local interventions and find that local interventions are more effective than global ones  We then study the relationships between incubation period and interventions  finding that early implementation of rigorous intervention significantly reduced the scale of the epidemic  Strikingly  we suggest a Pareto optimal in the intervention when resources were limited  Finally  we show that combining global and local interventions is the most effective way to contain the pandemic spreading if initially infected individuals are concentrated in localized regions  Our work deepens our understandings of the role of interventions on the pandemic  and informs an actionable strategy to contain it,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886355
7968,This study introduces machine learning predictive models to predict the future values of the monitored vital signs of COVID-19 ICU patients  The main vital sign predictors include heart rate  respiration rate  and oxygen saturation  We investigated the performances of the developed predictive models by considering different approaches  The first predictive model was developed by considering the following vital signs  heart rate  blood pressure  systolic  diastolic and mean arterial  pulse pressure   respiration rate  and oxygen saturation  Similar to the first approach  the second model was developed using the same vital signs  but it was trained and tested based on a leave-one-subject-out approach  The third predictive model was developed by considering three vital signs  heart rate  HR   respiration rate  RR   and oxygen saturation  SpO2   The fourth model was a leave-one-subject-out model for the three vital signs  Finally  the fifth predictive model was developed based on the same three vital signs  but with a five-minute observation rate  in contrast with the aforementioned four models  where the observation rate was hourly to bi-hourly  For the five models  the predicted measurements were those of the three upcoming observations  on average  three hours ahead   Based on the obtained results  we observed that by limiting the number of vital sign predictors  i e   three vital signs   the prediction performance was still acceptable  with the average mean absolute percentage error  MAPE  being 12  5   and 21 4  for heart rate  oxygen saturation  and respiration rate  respectively  Moreover  increasing the observation rate could enhance the prediction performance to be  on average  8  4 8   and 17 8  for heart rate  oxygen saturation  and respiration rate  respectively  It is envisioned that such models could be integrated with monitoring systems that could  using a limited number of vital signs  predict the health conditions of COVID-19 ICU patients in real-time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884136
6029,The ability of pathogens to develop drug resistance is a global health challenge  The SARS-CoV-2 virus presents an urgent need wherein several variants of concern resist neutralization by monoclonal antibody therapies and vaccine-induced sera  Decoy nanoparticles-cell-mimicking particles that bind and inhibit virions-are an emerging class of therapeutics that may overcome such drug resistance challenges  To date  we lack quantitative understanding as to how design features impact performance of these therapeutics  To address this gap  here we perform a systematic  comparative evaluation of various biologically-derived nanoscale vesicles  which may be particularly well-suited to sustained or repeated administration in the clinic due to low toxicity  and investigate their potential to inhibit multiple classes of model SARS-CoV-2 virions  A key finding is that such particles exhibit potent antiviral efficacy across multiple manufacturing methods  vesicle subclasses  and virus-decoy binding affinities  In addition  these cell-mimicking vesicles effectively inhibit model SARS-CoV-2 variants that evade monoclonal antibodies and recombinant protein-based decoy inhibitors  This study provides a foundation of knowledge that may guide the design of decoy nanoparticle inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909773
2588,BACKGROUND  Some vaccines elicit non-specific immune responses that may protect against heterologous infections  We evaluated the association between recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine  RZV  and COVID-19 outcomes at Kaiser Permanente Southern California  METHODS  In a cohort design  adults aged >  50 years who received >  1 RZV dose before 3 1 2020 were matched 1 2 to unvaccinated individuals and followed until 12 31 2020  Adjusted hazard ratios  aHR  and 95  confidence intervals  CIs  for COVID-19 outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression  In a test-negative design  cases had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and controls had only negative tests  during 3 1 2020-12 31 2020  Adjusted odds ratios  aOR  and 95  CIs for RZV receipt were estimated using logistic regression  RESULTS  In the cohort design  149 244 RZV recipients were matched to 298 488 unvaccinated individuals  The aHRs  95  CI  for COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization were 0 84  0 81-0 87  and 0 68  0 64-0 74   respectively  In the test-negative design  8 4  of 75 726 test-positive cases and 13 1  of 340 898 test-negative controls had received >  1 RZV dose  The aOR  95  CI  was 0 84  0 81-0 86   CONCLUSION  RZV vaccination was associated with a 16  lower risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and 32  lower risk of hospitalization  Further study of vaccine-induced non-specific immunity for potential attenuation of future pandemics is warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962997
4511,OBJECTIVES  To determine if and to what degree asthma may predispose to worse COVID-19 outcomes in order to inform treatment and prevention decisions  including shielding and vaccine prioritisation  DESIGN  Systematic review and meta-analysis  SETTING  Electronic databases were searched  October 2020  for clinical studies reporting at least one of the following stratified by asthma status  risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2  hospitalisation  intensive care unit  ICU  admission or mortality with COVID-19  PARTICIPANTS  Adults and children who tested positive for or were suspected to have COVID-19  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Main outcome measures were the following stratified by asthma status  risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2  hospitalisation  ICU admission or mortality with COVID-19  We pooled odds ratios  ORs  and presented these with 95  confidence intervals  CI   Certainty was assessed using GRADE  Grading of Recommendations  Assessment  Development and Evaluations   RESULTS  30  n 112 420  studies were included  12 judged high quality  15 medium  3 low   Few provided indication of asthma severity  Point estimates indicated reduced risks in people with asthma for all outcomes  but in all cases the evidence was judged to be of very low certainty and 95  CIs all included no difference and the possibility of increased risk  death  OR 0 90  95  CI 0 72 to 1 13  I 2  58   hospitalisation  OR 0 95  95  CI 0 71 to 1 26  ICU admission  OR 0 96  95  CI 0 75 to 1 24   Findings on hospitalisation are also limited by substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity  Within people with asthma  allergic asthma was associated with less COVID-19 risk and concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with increased risk  In some studies  corticosteroids were associated with increased risk  but this may reflect increased risk in people with more severe asthma  CONCLUSIONS  Though absence of evidence of a clear association between asthma and worse outcomes from COVID-19 should not be interpreted as evidence of absence  the data reviewed indicate that risks from COVID-19 in people with asthma  as a whole  may be less than originally anticipated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933924
1052,COVID-19 mortality forecasting models provide critical information about the trajectory of the pandemic  which is used by policymakers and public health officials to guide decision-making  However  thousands of published COVID-19 mortality forecasts now exist  many with their own unique methods  assumptions  format  and visualization  As a result  it is difficult to compare models and understand under which circumstances a model performs best  Here  we describe the construction and usability of covidcompare io  a web tool built to compare numerous forecasts and offer insight into how each has performed over the course of the pandemic  From its launch in December 2020 to June 2021  we have seen 4600 unique visitors from 85 countries  A study conducted with public health professionals showed high usability overall as formally assessed using a Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire  We find that covidcompare io is an impactful tool for the comparison of international COVID-19 mortality forecasting models,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988383
6798,A longitudinal assessment of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms  PTSS  and risk factors is indispensable for further prevention and or treatment  The longitudinal web-based survey enrolled 1 164 college students in China  Measured at two time points  February and August 2020   PTSS  demographic information  adverse childhood experiences  ACEs   resilience and self-compassion information were collected to explicate the prevalence and predictors of PTSS concurrently and over time  Results showed that although PTSS generally declined throughout the 6 months after the outbreak of COVID-19  the prevalence remained relatively high  Resilience and self-compassion negatively predicted PTSS concurrently and longitudinally  While subjective family socioeconomic status  SES  and ACEs at Wave 1 did not predict PTSS under COVID-19 at Wave 1  but both significantly predicted PTSS at Wave 2  Findings implicate potential targets for detecting and intervening on symptoms of trauma in this vulnerable population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900908
8310,Background and Objectives Whether exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  may predispose to the risk of cancer in individuals with no prior cancers is a crucial question that remains unclear  To confirm refute possible relationships between exposure to the virus and ex novo insurgence of tumors  this study analyzed molecular mimicry and the related cross-reactive potential between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein  gp  antigen and human tumor-suppressor proteins  Materials and Methods Tumor-associated proteins were retrieved from UniProt database and analyzed for pentapeptide sharing with SARS-CoV-2 spike gp by using publicly available databases  Results An impressively high level of molecular mimicry exists between SARS-CoV-2 spike gp and tumor-associated proteins  Numerically  294 tumor-suppressor proteins share 308 pentapeptides with the viral antigen  Crucially  the shared peptides have a relevant immunologic potential by repeatedly occurring in experimentally validated epitopes  Such immunologic potential is of further relevancy in that most of the shared peptides are also present in infectious pathogens to which  in general  human population has already been exposed  thus indicating the possibility of immunologic imprint phenomena  Conclusion This article described a vast peptide overlap between SARS-CoV-2 spike gp and tumor-suppressor proteins  and supports autoimmune cross-reactivity as a potential mechanism underlying prospective cancer insurgence following exposure to SARS-CoV-2  Clinically  the findings call for close surveillance of tumor sequelae that possibly could result from the current coronavirus pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877576
1020,BACKGROUND  Early Maladaptive Schemas  EMS   as lifelong psychological structures  tend to be associated with psychopathological symptomatology  Previous research has suggested that schemas act as psychological vulnerabilities to stressful life situations  such as the present worldwide COVID-19 pandemic  In this context  anxiety and psychological distress have been documented as two of the main psychological symptoms associated with the COVID-19 pandemic  However  the associations between specific EMS and COVID-19 anxiety remain unexplored  Therefore  this study aims to explore the relationships between EMS  COVID-19 anxiety  as well as other mental health variables such as psychological well-being  distress  and life satisfaction METHODS  In a cross-sectional design  two hundred and forty-nine individuals  N   249  M   34 2  SD   12 0  completed several self-report measures RESULTS  EMS from different schematic domains were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and psychological distress and negatively associated with psychological well-being and life satisfaction  An EMS hierarchical regression model predicted COVID-19 anxiety  Mistrustfulness and vulnerability to harm and illness mediated the relationships between COVID-19 anxiety  psychological distress  and life satisfaction  CONCLUSIONS  According to these results  mistrustfulness and vulnerability to harm and illness can act as underlying variables for the decrease in mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989057
5422,The systematic screening of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals is a powerful tool for controlling community transmission of infectious disease on college campuses  Faced with a paucity of testing in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  many universities developed molecular diagnostic laboratories focused on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing on campus and in their broader communities  We established the UC Santa Cruz Molecular Diagnostic Lab in early April 2020 and began testing clinical samples just five weeks later  Using a clinically-validated laboratory developed test  LDT  that avoided supply chain constraints  an automated sample pooling and processing workflow  and a custom laboratory information management system  LIMS   we expanded testing from a handful of clinical samples per day to thousands per day with the testing capacity to screen our entire campus population twice per week  In this report we describe the technical  logistical  and regulatory processes that enabled our pop-up lab to scale testing and reporting capacity to thousands of tests per day,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919584

8237,A comprehensive study of the B cell response against SARS-CoV-2 could be significant for understanding the immune response and developing therapeutical antibodies and vaccines  To define the dynamics and characteristics of the antibody repertoire following SARS-CoV-2 infection  we analyzed the mRNA transcripts of immunoglobulin heavy chain  IgH  repertoires of 24 peripheral blood samples collected between 3 and 111 days after symptom onset from 10 COVID-19 patients  Massive clonal expansion of naive B cells with limited somatic hypermutation  SHM  was observed in the second week after symptom onset  The proportion of low-SHM IgG clones strongly correlated with spike-specific IgG antibody titers  highlighting the significant activation of naive B cells in response to a novel virus infection  The antibody isotype switching landscape showed a transient IgA surge in the first week after symptom onset  followed by a sustained IgG elevation that lasted for at least 3 months  SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited poly-germline reactive antibody responses  Interestingly  17 different IGHV germline genes recombined with IGHJ6 showed significant clonal expansion  By comparing the IgH repertoires that we sequenced with the 774 reported SARS-CoV-2-reactive monoclonal antibodies  mAbs   13 shared spike-specific IgH clusters were found  These shared spike-specific IgH clusters are derived from the same lineage of several recently published neutralizing mAbs  including CC12 1  CC12 3  C102  REGN10977  and 4A8  Furthermore  identical spike-specific IgH sequences were found in different COVID-19 patients  suggesting a highly convergent antibody response to SARS-CoV-2  Our analysis based on sequencing antibody repertoires from different individuals revealed key signatures of the systemic B cell response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection  IMPORTANCE Although the canonical delineation of serum antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been well established  the dynamics of antibody repertoire at the mRNA transcriptional level has not been well understood  especially the correlation between serum antibody titers and the antibody mRNA transcripts  In this study  we analyzed the IgH transcripts and characterized the B cell clonal expansion and differentiation  isotype switching  and somatic hypermutation in COVID-19 patients  This study provided insights at the repertoire level for the B cell response after SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878902
3411,OBJECTIVES  Mounting evidence links hyper-inflammation in gravely ill patients to low serum iron levels and hyper-ferritinemia  However  little attention was given to other iron-associated markers such as transferrin  The aim of this study is to investigate the association of different iron parameters in severe COVID-19 disease and their relation to disease severity  SUBJECTS AND METHODS  This study involved 73 hospitalized patients positive for SARS-CoV-2  Patients were classified into two groups according to symptom severity as mild and severe  Blood levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies  IL-6  CRP and iron-related biomarkers were measured  RESULTS  The results revealed a significant increase in IL-6  CRP and ferritin levels and decreased transferrin and iron levels in severe COVID-19 disease  Transferrin negatively predicted variations in IgM and IgG levels  P< 0 001   as well as 34 4  and 36 6  increase in IL-6 and CRP levels respectively  P< 0 005   Importantly  transferrin was the main negative predictor of ferritin levels  determining 22 7  of serum variations  P< 0 001   CONCLUSION  Reduced serum transferrin and iron levels  along with the increased CRP and high ferritin  were strongly associated with the heightened inflammatory and immune state in COVID-19 disease  Transferrin can be used as valuable predictors of increased severity and progression of disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952211
4985,Background  Nurses have a high incidence of shift work sleep disorder  which places their health and patient safety in danger  Thus  exploring the factors associated with shift work sleep disorder in nurses is of great significance in improving their sleep health  nursing personnel staffing  and scheduling during the COVID-19 pandemic  Objectives  The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of shift work sleep disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors associated with shift work sleep disorder in Chinese nurses  Methods  This was a multicenter cross-sectional study using an online survey  Stratified cluster sampling was used to include 4 275 nurses from 14 hospitals in Shandong  China from December 2020 to June 2021  Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis and random forest were used to identify the factors associated with shift work sleep disorder  Results  The prevalence of shift work sleep disorder in the sampled shift nurses was 48 5  during the COVID-19 pandemic  Physical fatigue  psychological stress  shift work more than 6 months per year  busyness during night shift  working more than 40 h per week  working more than four night shifts per month  sleeping more than 8 h before night shift  using sleep medication  irregular meals  and high-intensity physical activity were associated with increased odds of shift work sleep disorder  Good social support  good work-family balance  napping two or three times per week  resting more than one day after shifts  intervals of 8 days or more between shifts  and taking turns to rest during the night shift were associated with decreased odds of shift work sleep disorder  Conclusions  Shift work sleep disorder may be associated with scheduling strategies and personal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic  To reduce the incidence of shift work sleep disorders in nurses  nursing managers should increase night shift staffing  extend rest days after shift  increase night shift spacing  and reduce overtime  and nurses need to seek more family and social support and control their sleep schedules and diet,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926396
6708,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  nucleocapsid  N  protein is essential for viral replication  making it a promising target for antiviral drug and vaccine development  SARS-CoV-2 infected patients exhibit an uncoordinated immune response  however  the underlying mechanistic details of this imbalance remain obscure  Here  starting from a functional proteomics workflow  we cataloged the protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins  including an evolutionarily conserved specific interaction of N with the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2  N localizes to stress granules and sequesters G3BPs away from their typical interaction partners  thus attenuating stress granule formation  We found that N binds directly to host mRNAs in cells  with a preference for 3  UTRs  and modulates target mRNA stability  We show that the N protein rewires the G3BP1 mRNA-binding profile and suppresses the physiological stress response of host cells  which may explain the imbalanced immune response observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901782
8498,BACKGROUND  Engaging influential stakeholders in meaningful exchange is essential for pharmaceutical companies aiming to improve care  At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited  the ability to interact  learn and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter  is of considerable value  AIM  The aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers  MATERIALS AND METHODS  We identified every global tweet  20 614 515  and scientific publication  44 135  regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020  Through author matching we combined datasets  resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors  Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement  FINDINGS  Globally  2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus  posting 110 346 diabetes-related tweets  As Twitter followers increased  so did tweet frequency  p < 0 001   retweets  p < 0 001  and replies  p < 0 001  to their content  Publication count  overall per month  and proportion of first last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to  p > 0 05   Those with the most academic co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks  < 50  p   0 001   Finally  those publishing most frequently on specific themes  including insulin  p   0 041  and paediatrics  p < 0 001   were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes  CONCLUSION  Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence  Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known  key opinion leaders  to perhaps lesser known  digital opinion leaders  with smaller academic networks  who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874534
9050,Background  The relationship between smoking and coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19  is still topical with mixed epidemiological evidence  However  the pandemic may affect people s beliefs toward smoking as well as their smoking behavior and quit intentions  Considering high smoking rates in Jordan  our current study aimed to assess the following domains in a community-based sample from Jordan   i  the beliefs that surround smoking vaping and COVID-19 and  ii  the pandemic impact on smoking behavior and quit intention  Methods  A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jordan from March 9 to March 16  2021  utilizing a web-based structured questionnaire  The questionnaire comprised 13 items on sociodemographic  health  and smoking profiles  14 items to assess beliefs surrounding COVID-19 and the use of combustible cigarettes  CCs   waterpipe  WP   and electronic cigarettes  ECs   and 12 items to assess the pandemic impact on smoking behavior and quit intention  Results  Of 2424 survey respondents who participated in our study  there were 1163 never-smokers  1044 current smokers  and 217 ex-smokers  The mean age of participants was 35 2 years  SD  11 06   Most participants have reported anti-smoking beliefs with around 72 9  believed that WP smoking is related to the risk of contracting COVID-19  Also  71 7  believed that smoking CC may worsen the COVID-19 clinical course  while 74 1  of respondents believed that smoking has no protective effect against COVID-19  During the pandemic  about 28 1  and 19 3  of current smokers reported increased or reduced smoking  respectively  Besides  459 current smokers have expressed their plans intention to quit smoking during the pandemic  of whom 27 5   n   126  confirmed that the driving force for their decision is a COVID-19-related reason  such as self-protection  n   123  and protection of family members  n   121  which were the most cited reasons  Also  around 63 participants have successfully ceased smoking during the pandemic  However  only 22 of them reported that the main driving motivation of their successful quit attempt was the COVID-19 pandemic  Conclusion  Most participants  beliefs and attitudes were against smoking during the pandemic  Nevertheless  the double-edged effect of the pandemic on smoking habits should be carefully considered  and reliable anti-smoking measures should be strengthened and sustained in the country,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866951

8103,BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  global outbreak allowed a natural experiment to observe how older adults changed social patterns and how it affected their emotional well-being  We studied the frequency and modes of social contact and their effects on older adults  mood before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  DESIGN  Phone-based surveys were administered weekly before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  SETTING  Participants were recruited from Portland  Oregon  and Detroit  Michigan  PARTICIPANTS  Older adults >  75 years old  n   155  age   81 0   - 4 5  72 3  women  were included in a randomized controlled trial  the Internet-Based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial  I-CONECT   MEASUREMENTS  Low mood was self-reported as feeling downhearted or blue for three or more days in the past week  Social contact was self-reported by the amount of time spent in interactions  with whom  family  friends  others   and via which modes  in-person  phone video call  text email letter   RESULTS  A total of 5525 weeks of data were derived from 155 participants  Before the COVID-19 pandemic  average social interaction time spent in-person  on phone video call  and via text email letter was 406  141  and 68 min week  respectively  During the COVID-19 pandemic  time spent in-person was reduced by 135 min week  while time spent via phone video call and writing increased by 33 and 26 mins week  respectively  In-person family contact was associated with less low mood regardless of the pandemic  odds ratio   0 92  p < 0 05   There was a COVID-19 x text email letter with friends interaction  odds ratio   0 77  p   0 03   suggesting that during the COVID-19 pandemic  an increase of 1 h of writing with friends per week was associated with a 23  decrease in the likelihood of experiencing low mood  CONCLUSION  The lost in-person time relating to COVID-19 restrictions tended to be partially compensated for with increased calls and writing time  although overall social interaction time decreased  During the COVID-19 pandemic  at least two types of social interactions  writing to friends and in-person family time  showed promise for mitigating low mood for older adults with limited social resources,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881436
5358,BACKGROUND  At the end of 2019  the world witnessed the emergence and ravages of a viral infection induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Also known as the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   it has been identified as a public health emergency of international concern  PHEIC  by the World Health Organization  WHO  because of its severity  METHODS  The gene data of 51 samples were extracted from the GSE150316 and GSE147507 data set and then processed by means of the programming language R  through which the differentially expressed genes  DEGs  that meet the standards were screened  The Gene Ontology  GO  and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  KEGG  analyses were performed on the selected DEGs to understand the functions and approaches of DEGs  The online tool STRING was employed to construct a protein-protein interaction  PPI  network of DEGs and  in turn  to identify hub genes  RESULTS  A total of 52 intersection genes were obtained through DEG identification  Through the GO analysis  we realized that the biological processes  BPs  that have the deepest impact on the human body after SARS-CoV-2 infection are various immune responses  By using STRING to construct a PPI network  10 hub genes were identified  including IFIH1  DDX58  ISG15  EGR1  OASL  SAMD9  SAMD9L  XAF1  IFITM1  and TNFSF10  CONCLUSION  The results of this study will hopefully provide guidance for future studies on the pathophysiological mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920753
7407,BACKGROUND  Pain is one of the most common symptoms of novel coronavirus disease  COVID-19   Being both a physical and a psychological experience  pain is affected by many factors  including biological  psychological  and social rather than a single variable  AIMS  To determine the effects of biological  psychological  and social factors on pain level among participants experiencing with the COVID-19  DESIGN  A web-based  retrospective  and descriptive study SETTING  Social media sources such as Facebook  WhatsApp  Instagram  and E-mail PARTICIPANTS  One hundred forty-nine participants were included  METHODS  Data were collected based on the biopsychosocial model  Pain level was evaluated using the visual analog scale  VAS   The data were analyzed using descriptive  correlational statistics  and structural equation modeling  RESULTS  The mean age of participants was 32 87  SD   11 32  years  The VAS scores were associated with gender  Z   -2 103  p    035   and chronic disease status  Z   3 001  p    003   and the Chalder Fatigue Scale total score  beta   0 718  p <  001  associated with biological factors  The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale scores among psychological factors showed a direct impact on the VAS scores  beta   0 583  p <  001   The Patterns of Activity Measure-Pain total score examined within social factors directly affected the VAS score  The VAS score did not correlate with age  smoking status  hospitalization status  respiratory support  marital status  education level  employment  and income status  CONCLUSIONS  The pain level in COVID-19 participants was determined by biological  psychological  and social factors  Females and participants with chronic illness  anxiety  fatigue  and low physical activity were found to experience high levels of pain  Education and counseling programs for pain management should be comprehensively structured and include anxiety reduction programs  and fatigue management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893431
8421,As the novel coronavirus  COVID-19  continues to spread  vaccine hesitancy increasingly threats public health worldwide  Health information from traditional  online and social media may influence vaccine hesitancy  The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of exposure to COVID-19 information from various media on vaccine hesitancy  as well as the mediating roles of public trust in government and vaccine confidence  With a sample of 438 online participants  mean age   30 69 years  responding to an anonymous questionnaire  the study tested a mediation model using bias-corrected bootstrap  The results indicated that exposure to COVID-19 information from online news media and traditional media can reduce vaccine hesitancy indirectly  Whereas a positive and indirect relationship between COVID-19 information exposure on social media and vaccine hesitancy was revealed  Trust in government and vaccine confidence were found to be salient mediators between exposure to COVID-19 information from various media and vaccine hesitancy  Findings from this study offer implications for strategies to address vaccine hesitancy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875950
251,Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19   caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   is an ongoing pandemic  Detection and vaccination are essential for disease control  but they are distinct and complex operations that require significant improvements  Here  we developed an integrated detection and vaccination system to greatly simplify these efforts  We constructed recombinant baculoviruses to separately display the nucleocapsid  N  and spike  S  proteins of SARS-CoV-2  Insect cells infected by the recombinant baculoviruses were used to generate a cell-based system to accurately detect patient serum  Notably  although well-recognized by our newly developed detection system in which S-displaying insect cells acted as antigen  anti-S antibodies from many patients were barely detectable by Western blot  evidencing that COVID-19 patients primarily produce conformation-dependent anti-S antibodies  Furthermore  the same baculovirus constructs can display N  N-Bac  or S  S-Bac  on the baculovirus envelope and serve as vector vaccines  Animal experiments show that S-Bac or N-Bac immunization in mice elicited a strong and specific antibody response  and S-Bac in particular stimulated effective neutralizing antibodies without the need for adjuvant  Our integrated system maintains antigen conformation and membrane structure to facilitate serum detection and antibody stimulation  Thus  compared with currently available technologies  our system represents a simplified and efficient platform for better SARS-CoV-2 detection and vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003088

4077,BACKGROUND  In Italy  healthcare workers  HCWs  were among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccination  Aim of the present study is to evaluate frequency and severity of adverse events  AEs  following the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine among HCWs of a large university hospital in Milan  Italy  METHODS  One month after having received the second dose of vaccine  HCWs filled-in a form about type  severity  and duration of post-vaccination local and systemic symptoms  We calculated the overall frequency of AEs and used multivariable Poisson regression models  adjusted for sex  age  BMI  smoking  allergy history  previous SARS-CoV-2 infection  anti-hypertensive therapy  and occupation  to calculate risk ratios  RR  and 95  confidence intervals  CI  of AEs according to selected variables  RESULTS  We included 3659 HCWs  Overall  2801  76 6   experienced at least one local event  with pain at injection site being the most frequent  2788  76 2    Systemic events were reported by 2080  56 8   HCWs  with fatigue  52 3    muscle pain  42 2    headache  37 7    joint pain  31 9    and fever  26 2   being the most frequent  Risks of systemic events were associated with female gender  RR 1 14  CI  1 06-1 23   age  strong decrease with increasing age  p-trend<0 001   allergy history  RR 1 13  CI  1 05-1 20   and current smoking  RR 0 90  CI  0 84-0 97   HCWs with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection  even if symptomatic  were not at increased risk  CONCLUSIONS  Both local and systemic acute effects after second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine were frequently reported  However  symptoms were mostly light mild and of short duration  Thus  our findings support the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in adults in relatively good health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939617
2232,We report the in vitro antiviral activity of DZNep  3-Deazaneplanocin A  an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase  against SARS-CoV-2  besides demonstrating its protective efficacy against lethal infection of infectious bronchitis virus  IBV  a member of the Coronaviridae family   DZNep treatment resulted in reduced synthesis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and proteins without affecting other steps of viral life cycle  We demonstrated that deposition of N6-methyl adenosine  m6A  in SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the infected cells recruits heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1  hnRNPA1   an RNA binding protein which serves as a m6A reader  DZNep inhibited the recruitment of hnRNPA1 at m6A-modified SARS-CoV-2 RNA which eventually suppressed the synthesis of the viral genome  In addition  m6A-marked RNA and hnRNPA1 interaction was also shown to regulate early translation to replication switch of SARS-CoV-2 genome  Furthermore  abrogation of methylation by DZNep also resulted in defective synthesis of the 5  cap of viral RNA  thereby resulting in its failure to interact with eIF4E  a cap-binding protein   eventually leading to a decreased synthesis of viral proteins  Most importantly  DZNep-resistant mutants could not be observed upon long-term sequential passage of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture  In summary  we report the novel role of methylation in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and propose that targeting the methylome using DZNep could be of significant therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968527
9785,Given the huge increase in remote work that has accompanied the Coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic  understanding predictors of performance and wellbeing among remote workers has never been more timely  Effective communication is commonly cited as key to remote worker success  yet communication variables are rarely incorporated into remote work research  In the present study  we examined the relationship between communication frequency  communication quality  and supervisor-set communication expectations with daily job performance and burnout in an occupationally-diverse sample of employees  We used an experience sampling design and our hypotheses were tested with data collected over a 4-week period with a sample of 471 employees who shifted to full-time remote work due to COVID-19  Results indicated that daily communication quality was associated with daily performance and burnout  In addition  the extent to which supervisors established expectations about communication practices  e g   expected response times to email  at the onset of the transition to remote work was positively associated with performance  but not burnout  Task interdependence was also tested as a moderator  Task interdependence moderated the relationship between communication quality and performance  such that the relationship was stronger when task interdependence was higher than when it was lower  Task interdependence also moderated the relationship between supervisor-set expectations and performance such that the relationship was stronger when task interdependence was lower than when it was higher  Expected curvilinear relationships between communication frequency and outcomes were not detected  Based on our findings  we provide recommendations for practice and future research   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855422
2228,The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to more than 270 million infections and 5 3 million of deaths worldwide  Several major variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged and posed challenges in controlling the pandemic  The recently occurred Omicron variant raised serious concerns about reducing the efficacy of vaccines and neutralization antibodies due to its vast mutations  We have modelled the complex structure of the human ACE2 protein and the receptor binding domain  RBD  of Omicron Spike protein  S-protein   and conducted atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding interactions  The analysis shows that the Omicron RBD binds more strongly to the human ACE2 protein than the original strain  The mutations at the ACE2-RBD interface enhance the tight binding by increasing hydrogen bonding interaction and enlarging buried solvent accessible surface area,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968782

8192,BACKGROUND  Mobility restriction is the most effective measure to control the spread of infectious disease at its early stage  especially if a cure and vaccine are not available  When control of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  required strong precautionary measures  lockdowns were necessarily implemented in countries around the globe  Public health risk communication about the justification and scope of a lockdown was challenging as it involved a conflict between solidarity and individual liberty and a trade-off between various values across groups with different socioeconomic statuses  In the study  we examined public responses to the government-announced  circuit breaker   a local term for lockdown  at four-time points in Singapore   1  entry   2  extension   3  exit of lockdown  phase 1  and  4  entry of lockdown  phase 2   METHODS  We randomly collected 100 comments from the relevant articles on new organisations  Facebook and Instagram pages and conducted preliminary coding  Later  additional random 20 comments were collected to check the data saturation  Content analysis was focused on identifying themes that emerged from the responses across the four-time points  RESULTS  At the entry  public support for the lockdown was prevalent  yet most responses were abstract with uncertainty  At six weeks of lockdown  initial public responses with uncertainty turned into salient narratives of their lived experiences and hardship with lockdown and unmasking of societal weaknesses caused by COVID-19  At the entry to phase 2  responses were centred on social-economic impact  disparity  and lockdown burnout with the contested notion of continuing solidarity  A temporal pattern was seen in the rationalisation of the lockdown experience from trust  anxiety  attribution of pandemic and lockdown  blaming of non-compliant behaviours  and confusion  CONCLUSIONS  The findings indicated a temporal evolution of public responses from solidarity  attribution of the sustained pandemic  increasing ambiguity towards strong precautionary measures  concerns about economic hardship and mental well-being to worsened social vulnerability  where the government s restrictive policies were questioned with anxiety and confusion  Public health risk communication in response to COVID-19 should be transparent and address health equity and social justice to enhance individual and collective responsibility in protecting the public from the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879835
9582,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed extreme living conditions of social distancing  which triggered negative mental health problems and created challenges in seeking mental health support  Mindfulness-based interventions  MBIs  have been found to enhance wellbeing and mental health by reducing stress and anxiety and improving emotion regulation  Preliminary evidence suggests that online  synchronous MBIs may produce beneficial effects similar to face-to-face programs  However  the effectiveness of such online-MBIs to support mental health in highly stressful times  such as a global pandemic  requires further study  To this end  we investigated the effect of an online 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction  MBSR  program on aspects of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  Participants  N 92  who expressed interest in discounted online-MBSR programs were recruited for the study  The division into experimental and control groups was based on actual enrollment to the courses  Those who enrolled in a program were assigned to the experimental condition and those who decided not to enroll served as controls  Participants were assessed pre-intervention  post-intervention  and 1-month post-intervention for levels of mindfulness  perceived stress  anxiety  emotion regulation  and intolerance of uncertainty  Differences between the groups were tested using the general linear mixed effects model  GLMM  and Individual Growth Curve Models  IGCM  in intent to treat analysis  The findings indicated that  relative to the control group  MBSR improved mindfulness abilities  p <0 001   decreased anxiety  p <0 001   and stress  p <0 001  and increased emotion regulation  p <0 001   These effects were found to persist 1 month after the end of the program  despite the increased governmental public-health restrictions due to COVID-19 at that time  The ability to tolerate uncertainty  a central characteristic of the pandemic  was not found to be affected by the program  A mediation analysis revealed that the effect of the intervention on mental health improvement was partially mediated by the improvement in emotion regulation  Overall  the findings provide positive evidence for the feasibility of an online-MBSR program to support the mental health of individuals from the general population through the mediation of emotion regulation in challenging times  such as a global pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858260

6429,The French health authorities extended vaccination against COVID-19 to adolescents in June 2021  during the epidemic resurgence linked to the delta variant and because of insufficient vaccination coverage to ensure collective protection  In May 2021  we conducted a national online cross-sectional survey of 2533 adults in France to study their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and their acceptance of child adolescent vaccination according to targeted age groups  <6 years  6-11  12-17  and its determinants  We applied a multi-model averaged logistic regression for each of these age groups to study the determinants of favorability to vaccination  Among the respondents  62 7   1597  accepted COVID-19 vaccination for adolescents  48 3   1223  for children aged 6-11 years  and only 31   783  for children under 6 years  Acceptance increased with fear of contracting COVID-19 and trust in institutions and decreased as the COVID-19 vaccine risk perception score increased  People favorable to vaccination in general and those sensitive to social pressure were also more often favorable to vaccinating children adolescents than those who were not  Drivers of acceptance were ranked differently for the different age groups  Understanding these differences is essential to anticipating obstacles to vaccination of these age groups and designing appropriate information and motivational strategies to support it,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905467
6308,Although Australia s rates of infection  illness and mortality from COVID-19 have been relatively low  they have escalated with the rapid transmission of the Delta variant  Restrictions imposed on people s liberties to curb the spread of the virus in several Australian States have engendered economic hardship  mental health challenges  and collective exhaustion and impatience  Several vaccines have been developed and approved for use in Australia that have proven effective in reducing the likelihood that the vaccinated will contract COVID-19 and  if infected  transmit and suffer serious illness and or die from it  Public debate has thus centred on whether mandatory vaccination could be the panacea for Australia s COVID-19 crisis  and several Australian governments and employers have already imposed vaccination requirements  This article explores some potentially significant implications of mandatory vaccination for two areas of the law - human rights and employers  liability - to consider whether  from a legal perspective  mandatory vaccination could constitute a viable solution to Australia s present predicament,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907682
3397,BACKGROUND  Prior to COVID-19  postnatal resettled refugee women in Canada reported barriers to healthcare and low levels of social support  contributing to maternal health morbidities  The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be further exacerbating health inequities for marginalized populations  The experiences of resettled refugee women are not fully known  AIM  To understand Syrian refugee women s experiences accessing postnatal healthcare services and supports during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  Semi-structured  virtual interviews were conducted with eight resettled Syrian refugee women living in Nova Scotia  Canada  who were postnatal between March and August 2020  Data analysis was informed by constructivist grounded theory  FINDINGS  Three themes emerged   the impacts of COVID-19 on postnatal healthcare    loss of informal support   and  grief and anxiety   Women experienced difficult healthcare interactions  including socially and physically isolated deliveries  challenges accessing in-person interpreters  and cancelled or unavailable in-home services  e g   public health nurse and doula visits   Increased childcare responsibilities and limited informal supports due to pandemic restrictions left women feeling overwhelmed and exhausted  Stay-at-home orders resulted in some women reporting feelings of isolation and loss  as they were unable to share in person postnatal moments with friends and family  ultimately impacting their mental wellness  CONCLUSIONS  COVID-19 and associated public health restrictions had significant impacts on postnatal Syrian refugee women  Data presented in this study demonstrated the ways in which the pandemic environment and related restrictions amplified pre-existing barriers to care and postnatal health inequalities for resettled refugee women-particularly a lack of postnatal informal supports and systemic barriers to care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952615
4672,Psychosocial hardships associated with the COVID-19 pandemic led many individuals to suffer adverse mental health consequences  however  others show no negative effects  We hypothesized that the electroencephalographic  EEG  response to transcranial magnetic stimulation  TMS  could serve as a toy-model of an individual s capacity to resist psychological stress  in this case linked to the COVID-19 pandemic  We analyzed data from 74 participants who underwent mental health monitoring and concurrent electroencephalography with transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  L-DLPFC  and left inferior parietal lobule  L-IPL   Within the following 19 months  mental health was reassessed at three time points during lock-down confinement and different phases of de-escalation in Spain  Compared with participants who remained stable  those who experienced increased mental distress showed  months earlier  significantly larger late EEG responses locally after L-DLPFC stimulation  but not globally nor after L-IPL stimulation   This response  together with years of formal education  was significantly predictive of mental health status during the pandemic  These findings reveal that the effect of TMS perturbation offers a predictive toy model of psychosocial stress resilience  as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic  and point to the L-DLPFC as a promising target for resilience promotion,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931185
8026,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to inflect immense burdens of morbidity and mortality  not to mention the sever disruption of societies and economies worldwide  One of the major challenges to managing COVID-19 pandemic is the negative attitudes towards vaccines and the uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations  We evaluated the predictors and factors behind the negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in 3 countries in the Middle East  METHODS  A cross-sectional  self-administered survey was conducted between the 1st and the 25th of December  2020  Representative sample of 8619 adults residing in Jordan  West Bank  and Syria  completed the survey via the Web or via telephone interview  The survey intended to assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to identify predictors of and reasons among participants unwilling hesitant to get vaccinated  RESULTS  The total of the 8619 participants included in this study were the ones who answered the question on the intent to be vaccinated  Overall  32 2  of participants  n   2772  intended to be vaccinated  41 6   n   3589  didn t intend to get vaccinated  and 26 2   n   2258  were not sure  The main factors associated with the willingness to take the vaccine  yes responses  included females  18-35 years old  Syrians and Jordanians  a large family size  and having received a flu vaccine last year  Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included the lack of rigorous evaluation of the vaccine by the FDA and the possible long-term health risks associated with the vaccines  the wait-and-see approach   CONCLUSION  This survey  conducted in December when the number of cases and deaths per day due to COVID-19 were at or near peak levels of the initial surge in the three regions under investigation  The survey revealed that most of survey s participants  67 8   were unwilling hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 with the lack of trust in the approval process of the vaccine being the main concern  the two main characteristics of those participants were more than 35 years old and participants holding a Bachelor s degree or higher  Targeted and multi-pronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan  West Bank and Syria,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882673
1886,A novel coronavirus has resulted in an outbreak of viral pneumonia in China  Person-to-person transmission has been demonstrated  but  to our knowledge  the spreading of novel coronavirus takes place due to an asymptomatic carrier  Most models are not considering testing and underlying network topology that shows the spreading pattern  By failing to integrate testing into the epidemiological model  models missed a vital opportunity to better understand the role of asymptomatic infection in transmission  In this work  we propose a model considering testing as well as asymptomatic infection considering underlying network topology  We extract the transmission parameters from the data set of COVID-19 of India and apply those parameters in our proposed model  The simulation results support our theoretical derivations  which show the impact of testing and asymptomatic carrier in infection spreading,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975210
5595,Since 2020  the COVID-19 pandemic has urged event holders to shift conferences online  Virtual and hybrid conferences are greener alternatives to in-person conferences  yet their environmental sustainability has not been fully assessed  Considering food  accommodation  preparation  execution  information and communication technology  and transportation  here we report comparative life cycle assessment results of in-person  virtual  and hybrid conferences and consider carbon footprint trade-offs between in-person participation and hybrid conferences  We find that transitioning from in-person to virtual conferencing can substantially reduce the carbon footprint by 94  and energy use by 90   For the sake of maintaining more than 50  of in-person participation  carefully selected hubs for hybrid conferences have the potential to slash carbon footprint and energy use by two-thirds  Furthermore  switching the dietary type of future conferences to plant-based diets and improving energy efficiencies of the information and communication technology sector can further reduce the carbon footprint of virtual conferences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916499

8329,Background  The current diagnostic standard for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  testing with nasopharyngeal  NP  swabs  The invasiveness and need for trained personnel make the NP technique unsuited for repeated community-based mass screening  We developed a technique to collect saliva in a simple and easy way with the sponges that are usually used for tamponade of epistaxis  This study was carried out to validate the clinical performance of oral sponge  OS  sampling for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  testing  Methods  Over a period of 22 weeks  we collected prospectively 409 paired NP and OS samples from consecutive subjects presenting to a public community-based free screening centre  Subjects were referred by their attending physician because of recent COVID-19 symptoms  n   147  or by the contact tracing staff of the French public health insurance because they were considered as close contacts of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case  n   262   Results  In symptomatic subjects  RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing with OS showed a 96 5   95  CI  89 6-94 8  concordance with NP testing  and a 93 2   95  CI  89 1-97 3  sensitivity when using the IdyllaTM platform and a sensitivity of 76 3   95  CI  69 4-83 2  on the Synlab Barla laboratory platform  In close contacts the NP-OS concordance  93 8   95  CI  90 9-96 7  and OS sensitivity  71 9   95  CI  66 5-77 3  were slightly lower  Conclusion  These results strongly suggest that OS testing is a straightforward  low-cost and high-throughput sampling method that can be used for frequent RT-PCR testing of COVID-19 patients and mass screening of populations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877351
344,Much research has been devoted to assessing the effect of commute duration on the subjective well-being of people  but as of yet  the respective body or research has been inconclusive as to whether there is indeed a  large  negative effect or not  To control the spread of COVID-19 governments around the world have taken unprecedented measures to control the outbreak of the Corona-virus  Forcing or strongly advising people to work from home  i e  at least those who can  is often one of these  The ensuing situation can be considered a natural experiment  the government s intervention effectively cancels people s commuting trip and can be considered completely exogenous  Should commuting time indeed have an adverse effect on well-being  it may be expected that those workers with long  pre-corona  commutes who have transitioned to working from home will experience an increase in their well-being  This idea is tested by combining several surveys -timed before and after the crisis- from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences  LISS  panel  a panel that is representative of the Dutch population  In line with expectations  the results indicate that workers with a long commuting duration who transitioned to working from home indeed increased their subjective well-being  However  this effect was found to be significant only for women and not for men  A more general finding of interest is that subjective well-being did not change much between the measurements before and during the corona-crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002104
8383,This paper investigates how social interactions  as shaped by religious denomination  are related to COVID-19 incidence and associated mortality in Western Germany  We observe that the number of infections and deaths during the early pandemic phase were much higher in predominantly Catholic counties with arguably stronger family and social ties  The relationship was confirmed at the county level through numerous robustness checks  and after controlling for a series of characteristics and county fixed effects  At the individual level  we confirmed that Catholics  relative to non-Catholics  have tighter and more frequent interactions with their family and friends  Moreover  the intensity of social interaction was able to partially explain the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and share of Catholics at the county level  Our results highlight the number of dimensions that have to be taken into account when designing and implementing mitigation measures in the early stages of disease outbreaks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876706

4631,Time-to-event data are right-truncated if only individuals who have experienced the event by a certain time can be included in the sample  For example  we may be interested in estimating the distribution of time from onset of disease symptoms to death and only have data on individuals who have died  This may be the case  for example  at the beginning of an epidemic  Right truncation causes the distribution of times to event in the sample to be biased towards shorter times compared to the population distribution  and appropriate statistical methods should be used to account for this bias  This article is a review of such methods  particularly in the context of an infectious disease epidemic  like COVID-19  We consider methods for estimating the marginal time-to-event distribution  and compare their efficiencies   Non- identifiability of the distribution is an important issue with right-truncated data  particularly at the beginning of an epidemic  and this is discussed in detail  We also review methods for estimating the effects of covariates on the time to event  An illustration of the application of many of these methods is provided  using data on individuals who had died with coronavirus disease by 5 April 2020,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931911

9061,The article typifies individual experiences as well as collective negotiations of the crisis and the handling of it in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of the platform Imgur com  For this  we draw on a sample of 2  of the highest rated posts  645 posts  published under the hashtag  coronavirus  The posts were coded according to the principles of  Visual  Grounded Theory and descriptively-statistically analyzed following a mixed-method approach  It is not only noticeable how many different media formats are used  but also that the participants  own posts appear alongside posts from other social media that have been reused  The platform itself is thus also a filter for contributions from other platforms  In addition  personal posts on dealing with the pandemic appear alongside political criticism and informative postings  Along the analyzed data material  it can thus be shown that users can combine different communication purposes  such as entertainment  information and social connection  in rapid succession on the same platform  One focus of the analyses is on the media format of memes  which play a prominent role in social media and which  due to their multimodality and their reference context based on adaptive seriality  pose challenges to the process of data collection and analysis  The reflection on the basis of the material therefore provides new impulses for the study of memes and communication on social media,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866859
6830,With rapid transmission  the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has led to over three million deaths worldwide  posing significant societal challenges  Understanding the spatial patterns of patient visits and detecting local cluster centers are crucial to controlling disease outbreaks  We analyze COVID-19 contact tracing data collected from Seoul  which provide a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of patient visit occurrence  Analyzing contact tracing data is challenging because patient visits show strong clustering patterns  while cluster centers may have complex interaction behavior  Cluster centers attract each other at mid-range distances because other cluster centers are likely to appear in nearby regions  At the same time  they repel each other at too small distances to avoid merging  To account for such behaviors  we develop a novel interaction Neyman-Scott process that regards the observed patient visit events as offsprings generated from a parent cluster center  Inference for such models is challenging since the likelihood involves intractable normalizing functions  To address this issue  we embed an auxiliary variable algorithm into our Markov chain Monte Carlo  We fit our model to several simulated and real data examples under different outbreak scenarios and show that our method can describe the spatial patterns of patient visits well  We also provide useful visualizations that can inform public health interventions for infectious diseases  such as social distancing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900559
579,This comparative study of community organizations serving marginalized youth in New York City and Amsterdam utilized a novel ethnographic approach called reverse engineering to identify techniques for social change that are active in each organization  adaptable and translatable to other contexts  It found that youth-serving organizations led flexible responses to the crisis of COVID-19 as it affected those marginalized by race  immigrant status  housing instability  religion and gender  The organizations employed techniques that they had previously developed to cultivate youth well-being - among them connectivity  safe space  and creativity - to mount tailored responses to COVID-19 related crises  In New York City  these groups addressed crises of material survival resources  personal protective equipment  food  housing  whereas in Amsterdam  youth-serving organizations focused on social connections and emotional well-being as the government met more of participants  material needs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34998135
9193,Telemedicine has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic  Our objective was to determine if patient satisfaction with telemedicine differed from in-person visits in an academic pediatric urology clinic  Following outpatient telemedicine and in-person pediatric urology visits  the validated NRC Health c  Patient Survey was used to assess patient experience  Patient satisfaction was assessed on a 10-point scale with scores of 9-10 considered  satisfied  and 1-8 considered  not satisfied   Satisfaction scores between telemedicine and in-person groups were compared using McNemar s test  Wilcoxon signed rank test  and conditional logistic regression  Fifty-one patients had urology telemedicine visits during April-August 2020 and completed the NRC Health c  Patient Survey  Propensity score matching was used to identify 102 in-person controls between January 2019 and March 2020  Ninety-two percent of telemedicine patients were satisfied compared to 87  of in-person patients  OR 1 7 95  CI  0 53-5 6    Regression analysis adjusting for matching variables demonstrated that patient satisfaction was higher for telemedicine compared to in-person visits but was not statistically significant  OR 1 5 95  CI  0 43-5 6    Patient satisfaction with telemedicine was similar to in-person visits in the pediatric urology clinic  Reduced waiting time and convenience associated with telemedicine visits provide an opportunity for telemedicine as a useful modality for pediatric urology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865548

8551,A long-haul form of progressive fibrotic lung disease has emerged in the aftermath of this pandemic  i e   post-COVID-19 lung disease  PCLD   for which we currently lack insights into pathogenesis  disease models  or treatment options  Using a combination of rigorous AI-guided computation and experiments  we show that COVID-19 resembles idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  IPF  at a fundamental level  they share prognostic signatures in the circulating monocytes and the lung  Viral pandemic  ViP  and IPF signatures   an IL15-centric cytokine storm and the pathognomonic AT2 cytopathic changes  e g   DNA damage  arrest in a transient  damage-induced progenitor state  and senescence-associated secretory phenotype  SASP   These changes were induced in SARS-CoV-2-challenged adult lung organoids and hamsters and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in the hamsters  Mechanistically  using protein-protein interaction  PPI -network approaches  we pinpointed ER stress as an early shared trigger for both COVID-19 and IPF  We validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs by immunohistochemistry  We confirmed that lungs from tg-mice  in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells  faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2  Thus  like IPF  COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells  The ViP gene signatures in monocytes may help prognosticate those at highest risk of fibrosis  The insights  signatures  disease models identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and other fibrotic interstitial lung disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873597
2741,Patients with COVID-19 generally raise antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 following infection  and the antibody level is positively correlated to the severity of disease  Whether the viral antibodies exacerbate COVID-19 through antibody-dependent enhancement  ADE  is still not fully understood  Here  we conducted in vitro assessment of whether convalescent serum enhanced SARS-CoV-2 infection or induced excessive immune responses in immune cells  Our data revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary B cells  macrophages and monocytes  which express variable levels of FcgammaR  could be enhanced by convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients  We also determined the factors associated with ADE  and found which showed a time-dependent but not viral-dose dependent manner  Furthermore  the ADE effect is not associated with the neutralizing titer or RBD antibody level when testing serum samples collected from different patients  However  it is higher in a medium level than low or high dilutions in a given sample that showed ADE effect  which is similar to dengue  Finally  we demonstrated more viral genes or dysregulated host immune gene expression under ADE conditions compared to the no-serum infection group  Collectively  our study provides insight into the understanding of an association of high viral antibody titer and severe lung pathology in severe patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960752
4908,As the COVID-19 pandemic has been highly stressful for parents and children  it is clear that strategies that promote long-term family resilience are needed to protect families in future crises  One such strategy  the Family Foundations program  is focused on promoting supportive coparenting at the transition to parenthood  In a randomized trial  we tested the long-term intervention effects of Family Foundations on parent  child  and family well-being one to two months after the imposition of a national shelter-in-place public health intervention in 2020  We used regression models to test intervention impact on outcomes reported on by parents in a standard questionnaire format and a series of 8 days of daily reports  We also tested moderation of intervention impact by parent depression and coparenting relationship quality  Relative to control families  intervention families demonstrated significantly lower levels of individual and family problems  general parent hostility  harsh and aggressive parenting  coparenting conflict  sibling relationship conflict  and children s negative mood and behavior problems   and higher levels of positive family relationship quality  positive parenting  couple relationship quality  sibling relations  and family cohesion   For some outcomes  including coparenting conflict  harsh parenting  and child behavior problems  intervention effects were larger for more vulnerable families-that is  families with higher pre-pandemic levels of parent depression or lower levels of coparenting relationship quality  We conclude that targeted family prevention programming is able to promote healthy parent and child functioning during unforeseen future periods of acute stress  The long-term benefits of a universal approach to family support at the transition to parenthood indicate the need for greater investment in the dissemination of effective approaches,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927239
5092,Background  The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought about radical changes in social life  The study focuses on a special group  Chinese undergraduate students with left-behind experiences  Specifically  the study addresses how such students feel and grasp the meaning in life and how they adapt to the current social environment after experiencing the impermanence of life  The correlation between the meaning in life and social adjustment in the post-epidemic period is evaluated  Methods  The Meaning in Life Scale and the Social Adjustment Scale were used to test 988 undergraduate students  Multi-factor analysis  correlation  regression  and dominance analysis were performed on the test results  Results   1  During the epidemic  Chinese undergraduate students generally had low meaning in life scores  including below-average values for life goals  and middle-range scores for social adjustment   2  Having or not having left-behind experiences had an important influence on the meaning in life and social adjustment of undergraduates  undergraduates with left-behind experiences performed better than those without left-behind experiences in terms of meaning in life  while their social adjustment was weaker than those without left-behind experiences   3  The zest for life and freedom of life of undergraduates in both groups negatively predicted social adjustment  and zest for life preferentially influenced social adjustment  Zest for life also had a significant effect on life value in the group without left-behind experiences  Zest for life was a priority factor influencing social adjustment  Conclusion  The epidemic and left-behind experiences are important factors influencing the relationship between meaning in life and social adjustment among Chinese undergraduate students,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925099
5665,INTRODUCTION  Since angiotensin converting enzyme-2  ACE2  was discovered as an essential entry factor of SARS-CoV-2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2   there has been conflicting evidence regarding the role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  RAAS  in COVID-19  This study elucidates pulmonary expression patterns SARS-CoV-2 entry factors  ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2  TMPRSS2  and RAAS components in lethal COVID-19  METHODS  Lung tissue from COVID-19 autopsies  n   27  and controls  n   23  underwent immunohistochemical staining for RAAS components  angiotensin receptors 1 and 2  ACE2 and Mas-receptor  and bradykinin receptors 1 and 2  Staining of individual cellular populations  alveolar pneumocytes  ALV   desquamated cells  DES  and endothelium  END   was measured by a binary scale  positive negative   SARS-CoV-2 was detected using immunohistochemistry against nucleocapsid protein  in-situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  Gene expression profiling for ACE2  ACE and TMPRSS2 was performed  RESULTS  Subtle differences were observed when comparing COVID-19 patients and controls not reaching statistical significance  such as a higher incidence of ACE2-positivity in END  52  vs  39   but lower positivity in ALVs  63  vs  70   and an overall downregulation of ACE2 gene expression  0 25 vs  0 55   However  COVID-19 patients with RAAS inhibitor  RAASi  intake had significantly shorter hospitalization times  5 vs  12 days   higher viral loads  57 517 vs  15 980 106 RNase P-gene copies  and decreased ACE ACE2-expression ratios  4 58 vs  11 07  than patients without  TMPRSS2 expression was significantly  1 76-fold  higher in COVID-19 patients than controls  CONCLUSION  Our study delineates the heterogeneous expression patterns of RAAS components in the lungs  which vary amongst cellular populations  and implies that COVID-19 patients with RAASi-intake present with a more rapid disease progression  although this requires further investigation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915500
2131,Introduction  the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic in March 2020  However  the pandemic cannot be ended overnight and more social distancing and other self-care measures are needed to protect our communities  Therefore  people s awareness  knowledge  attitudes  and appropriate behaviors are instrumental to containing the pandemic  The aim of this study was to determine COVID-19 awareness  knowledge  attitudes  and related behaviors in Libya  Methods  a cross-sectional online survey was conducted from October 10 th  to November 10 th   2020 in 24 cities in Libya  The participants were non-medical professionals who were living in Libya for at least 2 years and were at least 18 years old  Results  a total of 1018 participants completed the questionnaire  with ages ranging from 18-74 years  Mean   - SD   33 49  -13 24   nearly two-thirds were < 40  and 68 2  were females  Almost half of the participants considered the potential threat of COVID-19 to be low  and one in five reported that they were  Not worried at all  about getting COVID-19  In multivariate analyses  participants who were 40-49 years old  had master s degrees or higher  and worked in the private sector reflected high mean scores for both knowledge and attitudes  while those who lived in the Eastern or Southern regions had lower mean attitude scores  Conclusion  the low levels of awareness as well as the attitudes and behaviors among the public in Libya are worrisome  This study highlighted profound gaps that may put Libyan communities at high risk of a COVID-19 explosion  Therefore  immediate action is needed to address public awareness and attitudes and to improve COVID-19 related behaviors among the Libyan public,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970398

9216,BACKGROUND  Mask wearing mitigates the spread of COVID-19  however  many individuals have not adopted the protective behavior  PURPOSE  We examine mask wearing behavior during the height of the pandemic in Los Angeles County  and its association with COVID-19 testing and willingness to get vaccinated  METHODS  We conducted a cross-sectional survey using representative sampling between December 2020 and January 2021  through an online platform targeting Los Angeles County residents  Survey items include demographic characteristics  health conditions  access to health care  mask wearing  COVID-19 testing  exposure risk factors  and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine  We performed logistic regression models to examine factors associated with always mask wearing  RESULTS  Of the analytic sample  n   1 984   75 3  reported always wearing a face mask when leaving home  Being a female  Asian or African American  or non-Republican resident  or having higher education  having poor or fair health  having a regular doctor  knowing someone hospitalized for COVID-19  and being willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine were associated with always wearing a mask  Residents who were younger  had a highest risk health condition  and had >  2 COVID-19 tests had lower odds of always mask wearing  CONCLUSION  Mask wearing guidelines are easing  however  as vaccination rates plateau and new virus variants emerge  mask wearing remains an important tool to protect vulnerable populations  Encouraging protective measures among younger adults  those with less education  republicans  men  and White residents-groups that are least likely to be vaccinated or wear a mask-may be critical to reducing transmission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865166
4645,OBJECTIVES  To conduct a needs assessment with families and their healthcare team to understand the impact of restrictive family presence policies in the neonatal intensive care unit  NICU  in response to COVID-19  BACKGROUND  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic  significant restrictive family presence policies were instituted in most NICUs globally intended to protect infants  families  and HCPs  However  knowledge on the impact of the stress of the pandemic and policies restricting family presence in the NICU on vulnerable neonates and their families remains limited  METHODS  Individuals were eligible to participate if they were a caregiver of an infant requiring NICU care or a healthcare provider  HCP  in the NICU after March 1  2020  Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a virtual communication platform  and transcripts were analyzed using inductive thematic qualitative content analysis  RESULTS  Twenty-three participants were interviewed  12 families and 11 HCPs   Three themes emerged   1  successes  family-integrated care  use of technology    2  challenges  lack of standardized messaging and family engagement  impact on parental wellbeing  institutional barriers  and virtual care   and  3  moving forward  responsive and supportive leadership   CONCLUSIONS  Our findings highlight the significant impact of family restrictions on the mental well-being of families  physical closeness with parents  and empathetic stress to HCPs  Further study of potential long-term impact is warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931565
254,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to several pioneering scientific discoveries resulting in no effective solutions with the exception of vaccination  Moderate exercise is a significant non-pharmacological strategy  to reduce the infection-related burden of COVID-19  especially in patients who are obese  elderly  and with additional comorbidities  The imbalance of T helper type 1  Th1  or T helper type 2  Th2  cells has been well documented among populations who have suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  and who are at maximum risk of infection and mortality  Moderate and low intensity exercise can benefit persons at risk from the disease and survivors by favorable modulation in Th1 Th2 ratios  Moreover  in COVID-19 patients  mild to moderate intensity aerobic exercise also increases immune system function but high intensity aerobic exercise may have adverse effects on immune responses  In addition  sustained hypoxia in COVID-19 patients has been reported to cause organ failure and cell death  Hypoxic conditions have also been highlighted to be triggered in COVID-19-susceptible individuals and COVID-19 survivors  This suggests that hypoxia inducible factor  HIF 1alpha  might be an important focus for researchers investigating effective strategies to minimize the effects of the pandemic  Intermittent hypoxic preconditioning  IHP  is a method of exposing subjects to short bouts of moderate hypoxia interspersed with brief periods of normal oxygen concentrations  recovery   This methodology inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors  activates HIF-1alpha to activate target genes  and subsequently leads to a higher production of red blood cells and hemoglobin  This increases angiogenesis and increases oxygen transport capacity  These factors can help alleviate virus induced cardiopulmonary hemodynamic disorders and endothelial dysfunction  Therefore  during the COVID-19 pandemic we propose that populations should engage in low to moderate exercise individually designed  prescribed and specific  that utilizes IHP including pranayama  yoga   swimming and high-altitude hiking exercise  This would be beneficial in affecting HIF-1alpha to combat the disease and its severity  Therefore  the promotion of certain exercises should be considered by all sections of the population  However  exercise recommendations and prescription for COVID-19 patients should be structured to match individual levels of capability and adaptability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003073

9411,BACKGROUND  Antibodies raised against human seasonal coronaviruses  sCoVs   which are responsible for the common cold  are known to cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 antigens  This prompts questions about their protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 severity  However  the relationship between sCoVs exposure and SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection are not clearly identified  METHODS  We performed a cross-sectional analysis of cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization to SARS-CoV-2 antigens  S-RBD  S-trimer  N  using pre-pandemic sera from four different groups  pediatrics and adolescents  individuals 21 to 70 years of age  older than 70 years of age  and individuals living with HCV or HIV  Data was then further analysed using machine learning to identify predictive patterns of neutralization based on sCoVs serology  FINDINGS  Antibody cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens varied between 1 6  and 15 3  depending on the cohort and the isotype-antigen pair analyzed  We also show a range of neutralizing activity  0-45   with median inhibition ranging from 17 6   to 23 3   in serum that interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike attachment to ACE2 independently of age group  While the abundance of sCoV antibodies did not directly correlate with neutralization  we show that neutralizing activity is rather dependent on relative ratios of IgGs in sera directed to all four sCoV spike proteins  More specifically  we identified antibodies to NL63 and OC43 as being the most important predictors of neutralization  INTERPRETATION  Our data support the concept that exposure to sCoVs triggers antibody responses that influence the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to ACE2  which may potentially impact COVID-19 disease severity through other latent variables  FUNDING  This study was supported by a grant by the CIHR  VR2 -172722  and by a grant supplement by the CITF  and by a NRC Collaborative R D Initiative Grant  PR031-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861490
3000,Background  The  third wave  of COVID-19 in Hong Kong  China was suppressed by non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs   Although social distancing regulations were quickly strengthened  the outbreak continued to grow  causing increasing delays in tracing and testing  Further regulations were introduced  plus  targeted testing  services for at-risk groups  Estimating the impact of individual NPIs could provide lessons about how outbreaks can be controlled without radical lockdown  However  the changing delays in confirmation time challenge current modelling methods  We used a novel approach aimed at disentangling and quantifying the effects of individual interventions  Methods  We incorporated the causes of delays in tracing and testing  i e  load-efficiency relationship  and the consequences from such delays  i e  the proportion of un-traced cases and the proportion of traced-cases with confirmation delay  into a deterministic transmission model  which was fitted to the daily number of cases with and without an epilink  an indication of being contact-traced   The effect of each NPI was then calculated  Findings  The model estimated that after earlier relaxation of regulations  Re rose from 0 7 to 3 2  Restoration of social distancing to the previous state only reduced Re to 1 3  because of increased delay in confirmation caused by load on the contact-tracing system  However  Re decreased by 20 3  after the introduction of targeted testing and by 17 5  after extension of face-mask rules  reducing Re to 0 9 and suppressing the outbreak  The output of the model without incorporation of delay failed to capture important features of transmission and Re  Interpretation  Changing delay in confirmation has a significant impact on disease transmission and estimation of transmissibility  This leads to a clear recommendation that delay should be monitored and mitigated during outbreaks  and that delay dynamics should be incorporated into models to assess the effects of NPIs  Funding  City University of Hong Kong and Health and Medical Research Fund,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957427

6033,Lethal COVID-19 is associated with respiratory failure that is thought to be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  secondary to pulmonary infection  To date  the cellular pathogenesis has been inferred from studies describing the expression of ACE2  a transmembrane protein required for SARS-CoV-2 infection  and detection of viral RNA or protein in infected humans  model animals  and cultured cells  To functionally test the cellular mechanisms of COVID-19  we generated hACE2  fl  animals in which human ACE2  hACE2  is expressed from the mouse Ace2 locus in a manner that permits cell-specific  Cre-mediated loss of function  hACE2  fl  animals developed lethal weight loss and hypoxemia within 7 days of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with pulmonary infiltrates  intravascular thrombosis and patchy viral infection of lung epithelial cells  Deletion of hACE2 in lung epithelial cells prevented viral infection of the lung  but not weight loss  hypoxemia or death  Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 by hACE2  fl  animals resulted in early infection of sustentacular cells with subsequent infection of neurons in the neighboring olfactory bulb and cerebral cortexaeuro  events that did not require lung epithelial cell infection  Pharmacologic ablation of the olfactory epithelium or Foxg1  Cre  mediated deletion of hACE2 in olfactory epithelial cells and neurons prevented lethality and neuronal infection following SARS-CoV-2 infection  Conversely  transgenic expression of hACE2 specifically in olfactory epithelial cells and neurons in Foxg1  Cre    LSL- hACE2 mice was sufficient to confer neuronal infection associated with respiratory failure and death  These studies establish mouse loss and gain of function genetic models with which to genetically dissect viral-host interactions and demonstrate that lethal disease due to respiratory failure may arise from extrapulmonary infection of the olfactory epithelium and brain  Future therapeutic efforts focused on preventing olfactory epithelial infection may be an effective means of protecting against severe COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909769

1860,Background  Previous findings suggest that university students are at an elevated risk to experience financial hardship and to suffer from depressive symptoms  This vulnerability may have substantially increased during the coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19  pandemic which might have affected students  socio-economic situation but possibly also their mental well-being  We examined whether the financial situation changed during the COVID-19 pandemic among German university students  and whether changes were associated with mental well-being  Methods  We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in May and July 2020 at five German universities  Participants were asked  if they had sufficient financial resources to cover monthly expenses before and during the pandemic  The answer options were dichotomized into worsened and no change better financial situation compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic  Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D 8 scale  For examining associations between sociodemographic  study-related  and financial factors and  worsened financial situation   we ran a generalized linear mixed model  To assess associations between depressive symptoms and worsened financial situation  we performed a linear mixed model  Results  We included 7 199 participants in the analyses  69  female  30  male  1  diverse  mean age  24 years  standard deviation  4 7   Overall  25  of the participants reported to have a worsened financial situation at the time of the survey than in the time before COVID-19  Factors associated with a worsened financial situation were migration background  parents not being academics  not being able to borrow money  and payment of tuition fee by student and loan  odds ratios  OR  ranging from 1 20 to 2 35   Factors associated with lower odds were  being single  living with others  studying a health-related field  being enrolled in a doctoral Ph D  or state exam program  and publicly funded tuition tuition paid with a scholarship  OR ranging from 0 42 to 0 80   A worsened financial situation was associated with 1 02 points more on the CES-D 8 scale  95  CI  0 80-1 24   Conclusion  Our results suggest that the pandemic put a number of students under financial strain with detrimental consequences for their mental well-being  Renewed attention must be paid to this vulnerable group to prevent the potentially damaging effects on their mental health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975561
3918,The COVID-19 pandemic revealed fundamental problems with the structure of long-term care financing and payment in the United States  The piecemeal system that exists suffers from several key problems  including underfunding  fragmentation across types and sites of care  and substantial variation in payment across states and populations  These problems result in inefficient allocation of resources  limited access to care  substandard quality  and inequities in both access and quality  We propose a new federal benefit for long-term care  most likely as part of the Medicare program  Essential features of this benefit include taxpayer subsidies  along the lines of other Medicare benefits  and coverage across the range of long-term care services  including both residential and home- and community-based care  A new federal benefit has the most potential to break down administrative barriers and improve resource allocation  to ensure adequate payment rates across all states  to expand access to care by spreading risk across the entire Medicare population  and to improve equity by extending coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries who want it  A new federal benefit is politically challenging  requiring bold action by Congress  and entails the risks of administrative challenges and unintended consequences  However  in this case  retaining the status quo remains the far greater risk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942158

7148,PURPOSE  Cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic represents a challenge  Hospital visits to receive treatment and interaction with health care workers  HCW  represent potential contagious events  We aimed to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among patients with cancer and HCW of a chemoradiotherapy unit localized in a center designated as a COVID-19 priority facility in Mexico City  We also determined the diagnostic performance of a clinical questionnaire  CQ  as a screening tool and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroconversion rate  METHODS  HCW and patients with solid tumors attending the chemoradiotherapy unit signed informed consent  To determine SARS-CoV-2 infection rate prospectively  a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  was performed every 2 weeks in asymptomatics  An electronic CQ interrogating COVID-19-related symptoms was sent daily  Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G  IgG  antibodies were measured at baseline and at the end of the study period  RESULTS  From June to September 2020  we included 130 asymptomatic participants  44 6  HCW and 55 4  patients with cancer  During a median follow-up of 85 days  634 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed  Average SARS-CoV-2 monthly incidence was 4 6   3 15 -7 47    and cumulative infection rate was 13 8   18 of 130   Cases were mostly asymptomatic  66    and no hospitalizations or deaths were recorded  The CQ as a screening tool provided a sensitivity of 27 7   a positive predictive value of 26 3   and a positive likelihood ratio of 12  SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate was 27 7  among those with a positive RT-PCR  CONCLUSION  Patients with cancer on treatment can have uncomplicated COVID-19 outcomes  Biweekly RT-qPCR testing detects asymptomatic infections  prevents transmission  and should be implemented in units to increase patient safety  CQ increase RT-qPCR diagnostic yield and may prioritize testing in resource-deprived settings  Post-infection IgG seroconversion is unreliable,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898237
5838,The main presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection is respiratory  However  there are extrapulmonary manifestations such as myocardial and pericardial injury  The term long COVID syndrome describes the persistence of symptoms in patients who have recovered from the infection  A 31-year-old man presented with mild coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  symptoms for three days  Two weeks later  he developed chest pain  pericardial rub  and pericardial effusion  he underwent echocardiography showing pericarditis and an MRI which revealed inferoseptal hypokinesia and mild global myocardial hyperintensity  cardiac scintigraphy with Ga-67  and an inflammatory process in the myocardium  He was treated with methylprednisolone pulse  1g IV day  and tapering prednisone  5 mg day   with gradual evolution of symptoms for one year  In conclusion  this is a patient without comorbidities with clinical  laboratory  and imaging diagnosis of myopericarditis as a manifestation of long COVID syndrome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912599
3,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2  SARS-CoV-2  is consistently causing profound wounds in the global healthcare system due to its increased transmissibility  Currently  there is an urgent unmet need to identify the underlying dynamic associations among COVID-19 patients and distinguish patient subgroups with common clinical profiles towards the development of robust classifiers for ICU admission and mortality  To address this need  we propose a four step pipeline which   i  enhances the quality of multiple timeseries clinical data through an automated data curation workflow   ii  deploys Dynamic Bayesian Networks  DBNs  for the detection of features with increased connectivity based on dynamic association analysis across multiple points   iii  utilizes Self Organizing Maps  SOMs  and trajectory analysis for the early identification of COVID-19 patients with common clinical profiles  and  iv  trains robust multiple additive regression trees  MART  for ICU admission and mortality classification based on the extracted homogeneous clusters  to identify risk factors and biomarkers for disease progression  The contribution of the extracted clusters and the dynamically associated clinical data improved the classification performance for ICU admission to sensitivity 0 83 and specificity 0 83  and for mortality to sensitivity 0 74 and specificity 0 76  Additional information was included to enhance the performance of the classifiers yielding an increase by 4  in sensitivity and specificity for mortality  According to the risk factor analysis  the number of lymphocytes  SatO2  PO2 FiO2  and O2 supply type were highlighted as risk factors for ICU admission and the percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes  PO2 FiO2  LDH  and ALP for mortality  among others  To our knowledge  this is the first study that combines dynamic modeling with clustering analysis to identify homogeneous groups of COVID-19 patients towards the development of robust classifiers for ICU admission and mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007991
9120,Due to COVID-19  the whole world is undergoing a devastating situation  but treatment with no such drug candidates still has been established exclusively  In that context  69 diverse chemicals with potential SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibitory property were taken into consideration for building different internally and externally validated linear  SW-MLR and GA-MLR   non-linear  ANN and SVM  QSAR  and HQSAR models to identify important structural and physicochemical characters required for SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibition  Importantly  2-oxopyrrolidinyl methyl and benzylester functions  and methylene  hydroxy  sulphonic acid warhead group  were crucial for retaining higher SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibition  These GA-MLR and HQSAR models were also applied to predict some already repurposed drugs  As per the GA-MLR model  curcumin  ribavirin  saquinavir  sepimostat  and remdesivir were found to be the potent ones  whereas according to the HQSAR model  lurasidone  saquinavir  lopinavir  elbasvir  and paritaprevir were the highly effective SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro  inhibitors  The binding modes of those repurposed drugs were also justified by the molecular docking  molecular dynamics  MD  simulation  and binding energy calculations conducted by several groups of researchers  This current work  therefore  may be able to find out important structural parameters to accelerate the COVID-19 drug discovery processes in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866654
7209,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corovirus2  SARS-CoV-2  has been determined to be the cause of the current pandemic  Typical symptoms of patient having COVID-19 are fever  runny nose  cough  dry or not  and dyspnea  Several vaccines are available in markets that are tackling current pandemic  Many different strains of SAR-CoV-2 have been evolved with the passage of time  The emergence of VOCs particularly the B 1 351   South African   variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be more resistant than other SARS-CoV-2 strains to the current vaccines  Thus  the current research is focused to design multi-epitope subunit Vaccine  MEV  using structural vaccinology techniques  As a result  the designed MEV exhibit antigenic properties and possess therapeutic features that can trigger an immunological response against COVID-19  Furthermore  validation of the MEV using immune simulation and in silico cloning revealed that the proposed vaccine candidate effectively triggered the immune response  Conclusively  the developed MEV needs further wet lab exploration and could be a viable vaccine to manage and prevent COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896886

6689,Background  All new graduate medical doctors in Indonesia will work in government healthcare facilities for one year as internship doctors  Problems such as the shortage of PPE  no specific treatment guidelines  and inadequate support from authorities  contributed to mental health problems  This study aimed to determine mental health problems and associated demographics and concerns of Indonesian internship doctors in the COVID-19 pandemic era  Methods  This cross-sectional study was performed from 1-31 Januari 2021 via Google Form questionnaire to collect data  Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between demographic data  concerns in internship doctors  working place  and mental health using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21  Results  Depression  anxiety  and stress in internship doctors were 32 6  44 1  and 19 5  consecutively  Multivariate analysis showed that the only demographic factor associated with depression was female sex  Concerns of internship doctors were the most factors associated with mental health  Working in triage was associated with depression and stress  Donning and doffing training of PPE  difficulty to practice physical distancing and hesitancy to attend patients were associated with depression and anxiety  Difficulty to practice physical distancing in hospital w associated with anxiety and stress  Limitation  Firstly  some difficulties in data collection  Secondly  the self-reported tools of mental health are not always aligned with the psychiatric assessment  Lastly  possibility of recall biases from each batch  Conclusions  To minimize mental health problems of internship doctors  their concerns must be tackled  Medical schools have an important role to manage concerns of these internship doctors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901916
435,The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown have dramatically impacted families  life  raising serious concerns about children s emotional wellbeing  However  few studies have investigated whether the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological adjustment in youngest can be moderated by maternal mood and  to our knowledge  none of them has adopted a longitudinal design  The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from pre- to during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design  To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms  the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown  when their children were 1  Wave P1  and 3 years old  Wave P2   respectively  and by 74 women during the lockdown  when their children were 4 years old  Wave L   Mothers also filled in the CBCL 1  1 2 -5 to assess their children s emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave  As a whole  children s emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from pre- to during the lockdown  Furthermore  maternal mood moderated this trajectory  In particular  greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in emotional reactive  anxious-depressed  withdrawn and aggressive symptoms during the lockdown  These results contribute to shed light on the role played by maternal emotional wellbeing in buffering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children s behavioural development  Albeit preliminary  the current findings highlight the need to provide timely psychological interventions to distressed mothers to help their children to better cope with the effects of the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001205
1084,Objective Rates of anxiety have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  partially attributable to the experience of COVID-19 related concerns  It remains pivotal to determine the implications of such concerns on the severity of anxiety as they may represent opportune targets for public health preventative or therapeutic efforts  The current study evaluated COVID-19 related concerns as predictors of anxiety symptom severity  It also assessed the relative risk associated with sub-types of COVID-19 concerns  the role of age  sex  and minority status as potential moderators  and the unique contribution of COVID-19 concerns beyond sociodemographics  perceived stress  and self-reported general mental health  Methods The data source was obtained from the publicly available  Crowdsourcing  Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health survey  conducted by Statistics Canada  Participants were Canadians aged 15 and older living in ten provinces or three territories  Only participants that completed the self-reported sociodemographics  COVID-19 concerns  and general anxiety symptoms measures were included  n   44549   Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate continuous reports of anxiety symptoms  and the relative risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels was determined using chi-square non-parametric testing  Results Within the sample  29 1  met cut-off levels of anxiety  Levels of coping and security  R 2    0 205  p < 0 001   distal  R 2    0 043  p < 0 001   and proximal concerns  R 2    0 122  p < 0 001  were found to predict the severity of anxiety experiences  which was determined to be robust to statistical control for sociodemographics  perceived stress and self-reported general mental health  DeltaR 2    0 0625  p < 0 001   Minority status and sex were significant moderating variables  although the interaction accounted for less than 0 1  of the observed variance  Family stress from confinement  support during and after the crisis and personal health concerns significantly predicted more than a 200  increase in the risk of meeting anxiety cut-off levels  Conclusion The current study represents a novel examination of COVID-19-related concerns as risk factors for the experience of anxiety amongst a sizeable Canadian cohort  Coping and security-related concerns represented robust predictors of anxiety symptom experiences  Participants who experienced concerns relating to their proximal social groups were two times more at risk for meeting cut-off anxiety levels than individuals without such concerns  Longitudinal and evidence synthesis remains essential for identifying therapeutic targets and developing pandemic-related public health prevention and care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987892
6027,The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has been designated a variant of concern because its spike protein is heavily mutated  In particular  Omicron spike is mutated at 5 positions  K417  N440  E484  Q493 and N501  that have been associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies induced by either infection with or immunization against the early Washington strain of SARS-CoV-2  The mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2  SARS2-N501Y MA30   contains a spike that is also heavily mutated  with mutations at 4 of the 5 positions in Omicron spike associated with neutralizing antibody escape  K417  E484  Q493 and N501   In this manuscript we show that intranasal immunization with a pre-fusion stabilized Washington strain spike  expressed from a highly attenuated  replication-competent vaccinia virus construct  NYVAC-KC  fully protected mice against disease and death from SARS2-N501Y MA30   Similarly  immunization by scarification on the skin fully protected against death  but not from mild disease  This data demonstrates that Washington strain spike  when expressed from a highly attenuated  replication-competent poxvirus  administered without parenteral injection can fully protect against the heavily mutated mouse-adapted SARS2-N501Y MA30,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909775
1233,COVID-19 revealed and magnified the pre-existing health inequities faced by many vulnerable groups  The Latinx community is one of these groups and has borne the brunt of disparate rates of infection  hospitalization  and mortality associated with COVID-19  These disparities are rooted in social inequities  such as poverty and lack of access to health care  as well as health inequities associated with disparate disease and condition burdens  Moreover  the lack of an adequate Latinx physician workforce contributes to and exacerbates these inequities  The COVID-19 pandemic has intersected with the U S  Supreme Court s decision in the Department of Homeland Security v  Regents of the University of California case  The court s decision in this case struck down the attempted ending of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  DACA  program  although it was settled that the government could end the program if it was done lawfully  Even though this constitutes a win for DACA recipients  the decision is a stopgap as the future of DACA recipients remains vulnerable and subject to other legal challenges and political vagaries  In a time when the need to ameliorate health inequities for the Latinx community is so pronounced  DACA recipient medical trainees could provide much-needed relief  Since the implementation of DACA  some medical schools have decided to accept DACA recipient students  but many do not  This access-limiting practice stymies a group of potential trainees who could help to increase the Latinx physician workforce  as the majority of DACA recipients are Latinx  This article argues that all medical schools should take steps to consider accepting DACA recipient applicants in line with the principles of health equity and suggests 5 recommendations for medical school admissions  support  and advocacy practices,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985043
7825,BACKGROUND  The effect of polyaromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  on human health differs depending on the duration and exposure path  OBJECTIVE  This study aimed to examine the effects of PAHs on the human health risks associated with long-term exposure both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODOLOGY  PM10 sampling for 24 h was conducted at six sampling sites  Al-Haram  Aziziyah  Al Nuzhah  Muzdalifah  Arafat  and Al Awali   On-site measurements were conducted from March 2020 to February 2021  PAHs were analyzed using Perkin Elmer GC MS  which was adjusted with standard reagents for identifying 16 PAH mixtures  RESULTS  The 24 h average PM10 concentration showed considerable inconsistencies  exceeding the WHO standards used for median exposure  25 0 microgm -3    The PAH intensities fluctuated from 7 67 to 34 7 ng m 3  in a suburban area  near a rush-hour traffic road  and from 6 34 to 37 4 ng m 3  close to business and light manufacturing areas  The highest carcinogenic compound levels were found in the Al-Azizia  Al Muzdalifah  and Al Nuzah areas because of the high traffic density  and the lowest concentrations were found in the Al-Haram and Arafat areas throughout the year  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic health precautions that were undertaken by the government of Saudi Arabia involving border entry limits and limitations of the Umrah and Hajj seasons  CONCLUSION  This study period is considered extraordinary as the Saudi Arabian government has undertaken successful preventive measures that have had a great effect both on the spread of the pandemic and in reducing air pollution in Makkah  More studies are required to examine PAHs  carcinogenic effects after the pandemic measures are eased across Makkah,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886471
708,INTRODUCTION  Delay between symptom onset and access to care is essential to prevent clinical worsening for different infectious diseases  For COVID-19  this delay might be associated with the clinical prognosis  but also with the different characteristics of patients  The objective was to describe characteristics and symptoms of community-acquired  CA  COVID-19 patients at hospital admission according to the delay between symptom onset and hospital admission  and to identify determinants associated with delay of admission  METHODS  The present work was based on prospective NOSO-COR cohort data  and restricted to patients with laboratory confirmed CA SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Lyon hospitals between February 8 and June 30  2020  Long delay of hospital admission was defined as >  6 days between symptom onset and hospital admission  Determinants of the delay between symptom onset and hospital admission were identified by univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis  RESULTS  Data from 827 patients were analysed  Patients with a long delay between symptom onset and hospital admission were younger  p<0 01   had higher body mass index  p<0 01   and were more frequently admitted to intensive care unit  p<0 01   Their plasma levels of C-reactive protein were also significantly higher  p<0 01   The crude in-hospital fatality rate was lower in this group  13 3  versus 27 6    p<0 01  Multiple analysis with correction for multiple testing showed that age >  75 years was associated with a short delay between symptom onset and hospital admission  <  5 days   aOR  0 47 95  CI  0 34-0 66   and CRP>100 mg L at admission was associated with a long delay  aOR  1 84 95  CI  1 32-2 55    DISCUSSION  Delay between symptom onset and hospital admission is a major issue regarding prognosis of COVID-19 but can be related to multiple factors such as individual characteristics  organization of care and severe pathogenic processes  Age seems to play a key role in the delay of access to care and the disease prognosis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995292

1041,PURPOSE  The use of lung ultrasound for diagnosis of COVID-19 has emerged during the pandemic as a beneficial diagnostic modality due to its rapid availability  bedside use  and lack of radiation  This study aimed to determine if routine ultrasound  US  imaging of the lungs of trauma patients with COVID-19 infections who undergo extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma  EFAST  correlates with computed tomography  CT  imaging and X-ray findings  as previously reported in other populations  METHODS  This was a prospective  observational feasibility study performed at two level 1 trauma centers  US  CT  and X-ray imaging were retrospectively reviewed by a surgical trainee and a board-certified radiologist to determine any correlation of imaging findings in patients with active COVID-19 infection  RESULTS  There were 53 patients with lung US images from EFAST available for evaluation and COVID-19 testing  The overall COVID-19 positivity rate was 7 5   COVID-19 infection was accurately identified by one patient on US by the trainee  but there was a 15 1  false-positive rate for infection based on the radiologist examination  CONCLUSIONS  Evaluation of the lung during EFAST cannot be used in the trauma setting to identify patients with active COVID-19 infection or to stratify patients as high or low risk of infection  This is likely due to differences in lung imaging technique and the presence of concomitant thoracic injury,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988751
4149,Increasing evidence has shown an unusual relationship between hypertension and COVID-19  which may not be as simple as previously thought  The purpose of our study was to determine the association of hypertension with the onset and development of COVID-19  A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the prevalence of hypertension in COVID-19 patients  as well as the usage of ACEIs ARBs  Metaregression analyses were used to evaluate the association of hypertension with disease severity and mortality  PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies  A total of 42 studies including 14138 patients were enrolled in the study  The proportion of hypertension in COVID-19 patients in China was 17 7  according to the enrolled studies  while it was 6 0  in a study containing 72314 confirmed cases  which are both much lower than in the general population  All of the data from the 11 provinces in China showed the same tendency  The proportions of hypertension were higher in severe ICU patients and nonsurvivors than in nonsevere ICU patients and survivors  The metaregression analyses suggested that both disease severity and risk of death were associated with the incidence of hypertension  A total of 27 6  of COVID-19 patients with hypertension received ACEI ARB therapy  The proportion of deaths in COVID-19 patients with hypertension treated with ACEIs ARBs was significantly lower than that in nonuse patients treated with ACEIs ARBs  In conclusion  hypertension may reduce the infection risk of COVID-19 but increase the risk of developing worse clinical outcomes  The use of ACEIs ARBs may benefit COVID-19 patients with hypertension,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938578
9088,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the way traditional higher education institutions deliver their courses  Unlike transitions from face-to-face teaching to blended  online or flipped classroom in the past  changes in emergency remote teaching -a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate remote delivery mode due to crisis circumstances- happen suddenly and in an unplanned way  This study analyzes the move to emergency remote teaching at the School of Telecommunication Engineering  Universidad Politecnica de Madrid   and the impact of organizational aspects related to unplanned change  instruction-related variables -class size  synchronous asynchronous delivery- and use of digital supporting technologies  on students  academic performance  Using quantitative data of academic records across all  N   43  courses of a bachelor s degree programme in Telecommunication Engineering and qualitative data from a questionnaire delivered to all  N   43  course coordinators  the research also compares the academic results of students during the COVID-19 pandemic with those of previous years  The results of this case study show an increase in students  academic performance in emergency remote teaching  and support the idea that organizational factors may contribute to successful implementation of emergency remote teaching  the analysis does not find differences across courses with different class sizes or delivery modes  The study further explores possible explanations for the results of the analysis  considering organizational  individual and instruction-related aspects,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866769
9084,During the COVID-19 pandemic  reports to child abuse and neglect hotlines have dropped significantly across the United States  Yet  during this same period  calls to domestic violence hotlines have increased  The purpose of this study was to examine if there have been measurable changes in domestic violence-related reports to child abuse and neglect hotlines  Using administrative child protection records from California  we plotted counts and proportions of child maltreatment reports with and without domestic violence allegations before and through the onset of school closures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic  We used an interrupted time series analysis to evaluate whether or not there was a change in domestic violence allegations in child protection reports corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic  We document that during the first two quarters of 2020 there was a 14 3  drop in the overall number of child protection reports  Despite a decline in maltreatment reporting overall  there was a 25  increase in the proportion of reports with allegations of domestic violence  Our findings suggest both the count and composition of reports to child protection agencies were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  The current analyses also showcase the seasonality of CPS reports generally  and reports with DV allegations  specifically,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866773
1558,BACKGROUND  The social distancing and suspension of on-campus learning  imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic  are likely to influence medical training for months if not years  Thus  there is a need for digital replacement for classroom teaching  especially for hands-on courses  during which social distancing is hardly possible  Here  we investigated students  learning experience with a newly designed digital training course in neurophysiology  with intercalated teaching blocks in either asynchronous  unsupervised online lectures and e-labs  or synchronous  online seminars  supervised by instructors  formats  METHODS  The accompanying anonymized prospective study included 146 student participants  At the beginning and the end of the course  students were invited to answer anonymous online questionnaires with 18 and 25 items  respectively  We conducted both qualitative analyses of students  survey responses and statistical analyses of the results of cohort-specific summative examinations  The summative assessment results were compared both between 4 current cohorts and with the respective historical cohorts  RESULTS  Despite having little prior experience with e-learning  4 5 on the 1-7 scale   students adapted remarkably well to this online format  They appreciated its higher flexibility  time efficiency  student-oriented nature  especially when using inverted classroom settings   tolerance towards the individual learning style and family circumstances  and valued the ability to work through lectures and e-labs at their own learning speed  The major complaints concerned diminished social contacts with instructors and fellow students  the inability to ask questions as they occur  and the lack of sufficient technical expertise  The students valued the newly developed e-labs  especially the implementation of interactive preparative measures  PreLabs  and the intuitive lab design offered by the chosen software  Lt Platform from AD Instruments   The summative examinations at the end of the course documented the quality of knowledge transfer  which was comparable to that of previous classically instructed cohorts  CONCLUSION  Despite the missing personal contact between the faculty and the students  inherent to online teaching  the all-digital training course described here proofed to be of good educational value and  in case the pandemic continues  is worse considering for the future  Some of the described building blocks  like digital lectures or interactive PreLabs  may survive the pandemics to enrich the medical education toolbox in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980108
4393,COVID-19 has generated a lot of information in different formats  and one of them is in the ontology format  Also  there are previous ontologies from other disciplines that can help to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic  Thus  due to the large quantity of COVID-19 information in the form of ontologies  approaches to ontology integration and interoperability could be beneficial  In this context  this research proposes a new ontology  called COVID-19 Pandemic ontology  which is the product of an ontological engineering process proposed in this research that allows the integration of several ontologies to cover all the aspects of this infectious disease  The ontological engineering process defines tasks of fusion  alignment  and linking for integrating the ontologies  The resulting pandemic ontology provides a simple repository for storing information about the COVID-19  reusing existing ontologies  to offer multiple views about the disease  including the social context  This ontology has been tested in different case studies to prove its capabilities to infer useful information about the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934805
1894,The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of participating in public events  among them elections  We assess whether the voter turnout in the 2020 local government elections in Italy was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic  We do so by exploiting the variation among municipalities in the intensity of the COVID-19 outbreak as measured by the mortality rate among the elderly  We find that a 1 percentage point increase in the elderly mortality rate decreased the voter turnout by 0 5 percentage points  with no gender differences in the behavioural response  The effect was especially strong in densely populated municipalities  We do not detect statistically significant differences in voter turnout among different levels of autonomy from the central government,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975184
5809,The effects of the urban morphological characteristics on the spatial variation of near-surface PM2 5 air quality were examined  Unlike previous studies  we performed the analyses in real urban environments using continuous observations covering the whole scale of urban densities typically found in cities  We included data from 31 measurement stations divided into 8 different wind sectors with individually defined morphological characteristics leading to highly varying urban characteristics  The urban morphological characteristics explained up to 73  of the variance in normalized PM2 5 concentrations in street canyons  indicating that the spatial variation of the near-surface PM2 5 air quality was mostly defined by the characteristics studied  The fraction of urban trees nearby the stations was found to be the most important urban morphological characteristic in explaining the PM2 5 air quality  followed by the height-normalized roughness length as the second important parameter  An increase in the fraction of trees within 50 m of the stations from 25 percentile to 75 percentile  i e  by the interquartile range  IQR  increased the normalized PM2 5 concentration by up to 24  in the street canyons  In open areas  an increase in the trees by the IQR actually decreased the normalized PM2 5 by 6  during the pre-COVID period  An increase in the height-normalized roughness length by the IQR increased the normalized PM2 5 by 9  in the street canyons  The results obtained in this study can help urban planners to identify the key urban characteristics affecting the near-surface PM2 5 air quality and also help researchers to evaluate how representative the existing measurement stations are compared to other parts of the cities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913037
7872,Food  energy  and water  collectively referred to as  FEW   security forms the key to human survival as well as socioeconomic development  However  the security of these basic resources is increasingly threatened due to growing demand  Beyond the widespread implications on public health  Coronavirus disease  COVID-19  has further raised additional challenges for FEW security  particularly for urban populations  as they mainly outsource their FEW demands from rural areas outside their physical boundaries  In light of that  this study reviews existing literature on FEW security to highlight the growing relevance of urban-rural linkages for realizing FEW security  especially against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic  To achieve this  relevant research documents have been identified through Elsevier s Scopus database and other sources  by applying search equations   The authors have accordingly underlined the necessity of shifting the conventional urban-centric approach to city region-centric development planning for the post-COVID-19 era  To this end  a framework has been suggested for translating physical urban-rural linkages to a partnership enhancing a collective response  The major elements of this framework are the conceptualization of national-level policies to support urban-rural linkages  The framework can play the role of a science-policy-action interface to redesign the FEW system in city regions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886218

9975,We report the case of a previously healthy 48-year-old man who developed an isolated abducens nerve palsy 18 days after presenting with coronavirus disease  COVID-19  confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  His main complaint at arrival was double vision  Ocular examination revealed a sixth cranial nerve palsy in the left eye  The incomitant esotropia at arrival was 30 prism diopters  Abduction was markedly limited  while adduction was normal in the left eye  The patient underwent complete clinical  neurological  and neuroimaging investigations  including cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis to rule out infectious causes  A conservative approach with orthoptic therapy and Fresnel prism was opted  Eight months after the onset of COVID-19  regression of the strabismus was observed  and the patient reported complete recovery of the diplopia  This case suggests that isolated abducens nerve palsy caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may improve with a conservative approach,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852059
4237,Stroke and COVID-19 are both traumatic and life-altering experiences that are marked by uncertainty  fear  and medical intervention  The devastation that stroke and COVID-19 oppress on an individual and a population is well established  and these traumas are potently magnified in the troughs of the COVID-19 pandemic  Furthermore  stroke has been shown to be a potential complication of COVID-19 infection  and while there is global controversy regarding this finding  it is undeniable that there are patients across the world presenting with both conditions concurrently  Thus  the topic of isolated stroke and the co-occurrence of stroke and COVID-19 amidst the pandemic both warrant considerable investigation on both a basic science level and a humanistic level  This opinion article advocates for a narrative medicine approach to better explicate the intertwining of stroke and COVID-19  Interviewing patients who presented with both stroke and COVID-19 as well as patients who present with stroke during the pandemic will provide the opportunity to gather and juxtapose individual illness experiences  including encounters with the health care system  relationship with care teams and care takers  recovery  and insights into the future  Creating  analyzing  and comparing such an anthology of illness narratives of the 2 patient populations will offer a unique understanding into the experience of different  yet over-lapping  medical traumas in an unprecedented time  With this deeper appreciation of patient accounts  the health care system can better recognize how to provide for future patients who present specifically with stroke or stroke and COVID-19  However  more broadly  this study can also afford insight into how the health care system can better provide for and support patients who present with complex diagnoses in the context of a complex healthcare system  which most probably will operate under the effects of the pandemic for time to come as well as other  future complicating factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937421
7172,The present study aimed to investigate the personal well-being and family distress of Italian caregivers during the lockdown  Five hundred sixty-five family caregivers and 638 age- and sex-matched noncaregivers completed a web-based survey  The following scales were administered to all participants  General Health Questionnaire-12 items  GHQ-12   Insomnia Severity Index  ISI   Brief Resilient Coping Scale  BRCS   and Family Distress Index  FDI   Caregivers were also asked to provide information about their family members with disabilities  Individual and family distress  as well as insomnia  were significantly higher in caregivers than controls  Contrariwise  caregivers reported lower resilience levels  Multiple linear regression showed that distress was higher in caregivers living in Central and Southern Italy  Individual well-being was negatively predicted by low independence measured by the activities of daily living  ADL   Family distress was higher in households of psychiatric patients  Finally  low resilience levels appeared as the strongest predictors of both individual and family distress  The lockdown caused severe distress among caregivers and families of people with disabilities  Support networks for people with disabilities and their families are fundamental to prevent severe consequences from a psychological  social  and economical point of view,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897728
8455,OBJECTIVE  Pre-existing health anxiety is associated with an intensified affective response to the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the general population  Still  results on the reaction of people with a diagnosis of pathological health anxiety  i e   hypochondriasis  are scarce  METHODS  In the present study  we investigated the course of  health  anxiety related to SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 in comparison to  health  anxiety related to other severe diseases  e g   cancer  in a sample of 12 patients with the diagnosis of pathological health anxiety during the  first wave  of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany  Both SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety and anxiety related to other severe diseases were assessed weekly over 16 measurement points  30 03 -19 07 2020  and primarily analyzed with fixed effects regression analyses  RESULTS  Unexpectedly  SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety was on average significantly lower than anxiety related to other severe diseases  d   -0 54  p <  001  and not significantly associated with anxiety related to other severe diseases or pre-COVID-19 health anxiety  CONCLUSION  It therefore appears premature to assume that SARS-CoV-2 related anxiety and other health worries are necessarily strongly interrelated and comparably high in people with pathological health anxiety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875465
3742,The immunogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 virus  SARS-CoV-2  vaccines in immunocompromised patients remains to be further explored  Here  we evaluated the immunogenicity elicited by complete vaccination with BNT162b2 vaccine in solid organ transplant recipients  SOTRs   A cohort of 110 SOTRs from Northern Italy were vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and prospectively monitored at baseline and after 42 days  Both SARS-CoV-2 naive and recovered subjects were included  Humoral response elicited by vaccination  including SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies  SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs   was evaluated  additionally  ex-vivo ELISpot assay was performed for the quantification of Spike-specific T-cell response  Results were compared with those obtained in a cohort of healthy subjects  In a subset of patients  humoral and T-cell responses against delta variant were also evaluated  Less than 20  of transplanted subjects developed a positive humoral and cell-mediated response after complete vaccination schedule  Overall  median levels of immune response elicited by vaccination were significantly lower with respect to controls in SARS-CoV-2 naive transplant  but not in SARS-CoV-2 recovered transplanted patients  Additionally  a significant impairment of both humoral and cell-mediated response was observed in mycophenolate-treated patients  Positive delta-SARS-CoV-2 NT Abs levels were detected in almost all the SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects but not in previously uninfected patients  Our study supports previous observations of a low level of seroconversion after vaccination in transplanted patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946223
5250,Global surgery as an essential component of global health  Global surgery is the study and practice of improving access to timely  quality  and affordable surgical care  It emphasizes horizontal health systems strengthening through addressing a range of health challenges in surgical care that improve health outcomes  particularly in vulnerable populations  Global surgery specifically contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030  SDGs  by addressing the elimination of poverty  SDG 1   ensuring good health and well-being  SDG 3   promoting decent work and economic growth  SDG 8   and reducing inequalities  SDGs 5 and 10   Global surgery issues transcend national boundaries and intersect with other global health issues such as migration and the COVID-19 pandemic  These issues are nested in a highly politicised environment  therefore power and politics should be considered when identifying problems and solutions  Despite evidence of its importance  the global surgery network has not generated substantial attention and resources compared to other global health networks  Global surgery can further increase its effectiveness through linking with health systems strengthening agendas  and identifying unified solutions to improve access to quality surgical care in low- and middle-income countries  Global surgery is indispensable in the achievement of health and well-being for all,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922839
7019,While information campaigns have been widely recognized as a pillar of public health crisis management and heightened by the current COVID-19 pandemic  an insufficient number of studies have investigated the impact of information disclosure on influencing citizen cooperation crucial for emergency management  Focusing on generic information disclosure practices during the recovery period from January 19  2020  to February 29  2020  in China and by employing a difference-in-difference method  this study finds that information disclosure significantly enhanced citizen coproduction as measured by aggregated search queries of COVID-19-related information  and earlier disclosure yielded greater effect more quickly  Moreover  government capacity and citizens  trust in government at the local level significantly moderate the positive impact of information disclosure  This study uncovers the novel relationship between information disclosure and citizen coproduction during emergencies in the Chinese context,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898859
3755,Time series of price returns for 80 of the most liquid cryptocurrencies listed on Binance are investigated for the presence of detrended cross-correlations  A spectral analysis of the detrended correlation matrix and a topological analysis of the minimal spanning trees calculated based on this matrix are applied for different positions of a moving window  The cryptocurrencies become more strongly cross-correlated among themselves than they used to be before  The average cross-correlations increase with time on a specific time scale in a way that resembles the Epps effect amplification when going from past to present  The minimal spanning trees also change their topology and  for the short time scales  they become more centralized with increasing maximum node degrees  while for the long time scales they become more distributed  but also more correlated at the same time  Apart from the inter-market dependencies  the detrended cross-correlations between the cryptocurrency market and some traditional markets  like the stock markets  commodity markets  and Forex  are also analyzed  The cryptocurrency market shows higher levels of cross-correlations with the other markets during the same turbulent periods  in which it is strongly cross-correlated itself,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945980
4429,Dengue has emerged as an alarming concern exhausting the already tired healthcare professionals during the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19  There has been an epidemic of dengue fever with massive underreporting  this might be a result of limited resources as well as the inability to reach healthcare facilities as a consequence of reluctance seen in patients due to the scare of COVID-19  Acute pain in the abdomen has been an alarming sign of dengue  however  its association with acute pancreatitis is rare  We report a case of a 21-year-old young male with fever  vomiting  and pain in the abdomen who was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis as a complication of dengue infection  We highlight the importance of screening for acute pancreatitis in patients with dengue presenting with pain in the abdomen as it may be a rare but important complication of dengue fever,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934545

5950,BACKGROUND  Although efforts to manage coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic have understandably taken immediate priority  the impacts on traditional healthcare-associated infection  HAI  surveillance and prevention efforts remain concerning  AIM  To describe trends in HAIs in a Tunisian university hospital through repeated point prevalence surveys over 9 years  assess the impact of measures implemented for COVID-19 pandemic  and to identify associated factors of HAI  METHODS  The current study focused on data collected from annual point prevalence surveys conducted from 2012 to 2020  All types of HAIs as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  were included  Data collection was carried out using NosoTun plug  Univariate and multivariate logistic analysis were used to identify HAI risk factors  RESULTS  Overall  2729 patients were observed in the 9 surveys  the mean age was 48 3   - 23 3 years and 57 5  were male  We identified 267 infected patients  9 8   and 296 HAIs  10 8    Pneumonia lower respiratory tract infections were the most frequent HAI  24    followed by urinary tract infection  20 9   The prevalence of infected patients increased from 10 6  in 2012 to 14 9  in 2020  However  this increase was not statistically significant  The prevalence of HAIs increased significantly from 12 3  to 15 5   P   003   The only decrease involved is bloodstream infections  from 2  to 1    Independent risk factors significantly associated with HAI were undergoing surgical intervention  aOR   1 7   the use of antibiotic treatment in previous 6 months  aOR   1 8   peripheral line  aOR 2   parenteral nutrition  aOR 2 4   urinary tract within 7 days  aOR 2 4   central line  aOR   6 3   and prosthesis  aOR   12 8   length of stay  aOR   3   and the year of the survey  Young age was found as protective factor  aOR    98   CONCLUSION  Contrary to what was expected  we noticed an increase in the HAIs rates despite the preventive measures put in place to control the COVID-19 pandemic  This was partly explained by the vulnerability of hospitalized patients during this period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910605
4373,Background  Long-term care facilities  LTCFs  have reported high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and related mortality  but the proportion of infected people among those who have survived  and duration of the antibody response to natural infection  is unknown  We determined the prevalence and stability of nucleocapsid antibodies  the standard assay for detection of previous infection  in staff and residents in LTCFs in England  Methods  This was a prospective cohort study of residents 65 years or older and of staff 65 years or younger in 201 LTCFs in England between March 1  2020  and May 7  2021  Participants were linked to a unique pseudo-identifier based on their UK National Health Service identification number  Serial blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein using the Abbott ARCHITECT i-system  Abbott  Maidenhead  UK  immunoassay  Primary endpoints were prevalence and cumulative incidence of antibody positivity  which were weighted to the LTCF population  Incidence rate of loss of antibodies  seroreversion  was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves  Findings  9488 samples were included  8636  91 0   of which could be individually linked to 1434 residents and 3288 staff members  The cumulative incidence of nucleocapsid seropositivity was 34 6   29 6-40 0  in residents and 26 1   23 0-29 5  in staff over 11 months  239  38 6   residents and 503 women  81 3   were included in the antibody-waning analysis  and median follow-up was 149 days  IQR 107-169   The incidence rate of seroreversion was 2 1 per 1000 person-days at risk  and median time to reversion was 242 5 days  Interpretation  At least a quarter of staff and a third of surviving residents were infected with SAR-CoV-2 during the first two waves of the pandemic in England  Nucleocapsid-specific antibodies often become undetectable within the first year following infection  which is likely to lead to marked underestimation of the true proportion of people with previous infection  Given that natural infection might act to boost vaccine responses  better assays to identify natural infection should be developed  Funding  UK Government Department of Health and Social Care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935001
1557,BACKGROUND  SARS-CoV-2 seems to affect the regulation of pulmonary perfusion  Hypoperfusion in areas of well-aerated lung parenchyma results in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch that can be characterized using subtraction computed tomography angiography  sCTA   This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of oral sildenafil in treating COVID-19 inpatients showing perfusion abnormalities in sCTA  METHODS  Triple-blinded  randomized  placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Chile in a tertiary-care hospital able to provide on-site sCTA scans and ventilatory support when needed between August 2020 and March 2021  In total  82 eligible adults were admitted to the ED with RT-PCR-confirmed or highly probable SARS-COV-2 infection and sCTA performed within 24 h of admission showing perfusion abnormalities in areas of well-aerated lung parenchyma  42 were excluded and 40 participants were enrolled and randomized  1 1 ratio  once hospitalized  The active intervention group received sildenafil  25 mg orally three times a day for seven days   and the control group received identical placebo capsules in the same way  Primary outcomes were differences in oxygenation parameters measured daily during follow-up  PaO2 FiO2 ratio and A-a gradient   Secondary outcomes included admission to the ICU  requirement of non-invasive ventilation  invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   and mortality rates  Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis  RESULTS  Totally  40 participants were enrolled  20 in the placebo group and 20 in the sildenafil group   33  82 5   were male  and median age was 57  IQR 41-68  years  No significant differences in mean PaO2 FiO2 ratios and A-a gradients were found between groups  repeated-measures ANOVA p   0 67 and p   0 69   IMV was required in 4 patients who received placebo and none in the sildenafil arm  logrank p   0 04   Patients in the sildenafil arm showed a significantly shorter median length of hospital stay than the placebo group  9 IQR 7-12 days vs  12 IQR 9-21 days  p   0 04   CONCLUSIONS  No statistically significant differences were found in the oxygenation parameters  Sildenafil treatment could have a potential therapeutic role regarding the need for IMV in COVID-19 patients with specific perfusion patterns in sCTA  A large-scale study is needed to confirm these results  TRIAL REGISTRATION  Sildenafil for treating patients with COVID-19 and perfusion mismatch  a pilot randomized trial  NCT04489446  Registered 28 July 2020  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04489446,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980198

5317,The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of individuals worldwide  The global scientific effort to design an effective vaccine against this virus has led to the development of several vaccine candidates  The expedited roll-out of these vaccines has created some public distrust regarding the safety of these new vaccines  This review compiles clinical data from reports of diagnosed immune-related neurological events that have occurred post-COVID-19 vaccine administration with the exception of those secondary to hematological abnormalities  A systematic literature search was performed  using several databases  to identify reports of post-vaccination adverse neurological events  The search resulted in 18 studies that met our criteria  These studies included 78 patients who had received COVID-19 vaccines and experienced at least one neurological adverse effect  The most common neurological event was Facial nerve palsy  62 3  of all events   Other less frequently reported events included the reactivation of herpes zoster  Guillain-Barre Syndrome  other demyelinating diseases  and neuropathy  The underlying mechanism was hypothesized to be related to vaccine-induced type 1 interferon production leading to decreased tolerance of the myelin sheath antigens  Other hypotheses include vaccine-induced transient lymphopenia and immune dysregulation  Most of the reported events were time-limited and resolved spontaneously  Given the rarity of reported neurological events compared to the total number of vaccines administered  and the similarity in the incidence of events between COVID-19 vaccines and other more common vaccines  there is little evidence to support a causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and adverse neurological events  This article is protected by copyright  All rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921562
6328,Controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic becomes increasingly challenging as the virus adapts to human hosts through the continual emergence of more transmissible variants  Simply observing that a variant is increasing in frequency is relatively straightforward  but more sophisticated methodology is needed to determine whether a new variant is a global threat and the magnitude of its selective advantage  We present two models for quantifying the strength of selection for new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the background of contemporaneous variants  These methods range from a detailed model of dynamics within one country to a broad analysis across all countries  and they include alternative explanations such as migration and drift  We find evidence for strong selection favoring the D614G spike mutation and B 1 1 7  Alpha   weaker selection favoring B 1 351  Beta   and no advantage of R 1 after it spreads beyond Japan  Cutting back data to earlier time horizons reveals that uncertainty is large very soon after emergence  but that estimates of selection stabilize after several weeks  Our results also show substantial heterogeneity among countries  demonstrating the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907182

1112,Antibodies  Abs  are essential for the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2  and all the vaccines developed so far have been designed to induce Abs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike  Many studies have examined Ab responses in the blood from vaccinated and infected individuals  However  since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus  it is also critical to understand the mucosal Ab responses at the sites of initial virus exposure  Here  we examined plasma versus saliva Ab responses in vaccinated and convalescent patients  Although saliva levels were significantly lower  a strong correlation was observed between plasma and saliva total Ig levels against all SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested  Virus-specific IgG1 responses predominated in both saliva and plasma  while a lower prevalence of IgM and IgA1 Abs was observed in saliva  Antiviral activities of plasma Abs were also studied  Neutralization titers against the initial WA1  D614G   B 1 1 7  alpha  and B 1 617 2  delta  strains were similar but lower against the B 1 351  beta  strain  Spike-specific antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis  ADCP  activities were also detected and the levels correlated with spike-binding Ig titers  Interestingly  while neutralization and ADCP potencies of vaccinated and convalescent groups were comparable  enhanced complement deposition to spike-specific Abs was noted in vaccinated versus convalescent groups and corresponded with higher levels of IgG1 plus IgG3 among the vaccinated individuals  Altogether  this study demonstrates the detection of Ab responses after vaccination or infection in plasma and saliva that correlate significantly  although Ig isotypic differences were noted  The induced plasma Abs displayed Fab-mediated and Fc-dependent functions with comparable neutralization and ADCP potencies  but a greater capacity to activate complement was elicited upon vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987505
6802,The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an extraordinary challenge for public health and health policy  Questions have arisen concerning the main strategies to cope with this situation and the lessons to be learned from the pandemic  This conceptual paper aims to clarify these questions via sociological concepts  Regarding coping strategies used during the pandemic  there is a strong tendency for health policymakers to rely on expert knowledge rather than on evidence-based knowledge  This has caused the evidence-based healthcare community to respond to urgent demands for advice by rapidly processing new knowledge  Nonetheless  health policymakers still mainly rely on experts in making policy decisions  Our sociological analysis of this situation identified three lessons for coping with pandemic and non-pandemic health challenges   1  the phenomenon of accelerating knowledge processing could be interpreted from the organizational innovation perspective as a shift from traditional mechanistic knowledge processing to more organic forms of knowledge processing  This can be described as an  organic turn    2  The return of experts is part of this organic turn and shows that experts provide both evidence-based knowledge as well as theoretical  experiential  and contextual knowledge   3  Experts can use theory to expeditiously provide advice at times when there is limited evidence available and to provide complexity-reducing orientation for decisionmakers at times where knowledge production leads to an overload of knowledge  thus  evidence-based knowledge should be complemented by theory-based knowledge in a structured two-way interaction to obtain the most comprehensive and valid recommendations for health policy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900888
2287,BACKGROUND  Loneliness and social isolation can have severe effects on human health and well-being  Partial solutions to combat these circumstances in demographically aging societies have been sought from the field of information and communication technology  ICT   OBJECTIVE  This systematic literature review investigates the research conducted on older adults  loneliness and social isolation  and physical ICTs  namely robots  wearables  and smart homes  in the era of ambient assisted living  AAL   The aim is to gain insight into how technology can help overcome loneliness and social isolation other than by fostering social communication with people and what the main open-ended challenges according to the reviewed studies are  METHODS  The data were collected from 7 bibliographic databases  A preliminary search resulted in 1271 entries that were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria  The characteristics of the selected studies were coded  and the results were summarized to answer our research questions  RESULTS  The final data set consisted of 23 empirical studies  We found out that ICT solutions such as smart homes can help detect and predict loneliness and social isolation  and technologies such as robotic pets and some other social robots can help alleviate loneliness to some extent  The main open-ended challenges across studies relate to the need for more robust study samples and study designs  Further  the reviewed studies report technology- and topic-specific open-ended challenges  CONCLUSIONS  Technology can help assess older adults  loneliness and social isolation  and alleviate loneliness without direct interaction with other people  The results are highly relevant in the COVID-19 era  where various social restrictions have been introduced all over the world  and the amount of research literature in this regard has increased recently,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967760
7993,While it took decades to arrive to a conclusion that ferritin is more than an indicator of iron storage level  it took a short period of time through the COVID-19 pandemic to wonder what the reason behind high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 might be  Unsurprisingly  acute phase reactant was not a satisfactory explanation  Moreover  the behavior of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19 and the subsequent high mortality rates in patients with high ferritin levels necessitated further investigations to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases  Ferritin was initially described to accompany various acute infections  both viral and bacterial  indicating an acute response to inflammation  However  with the introduction of the hyperferritinemic syndrome connecting four severe pathological conditions such as adult-onset Still s disease  macrophage activation syndrome  catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome  and septic shock added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a pathogenetic role rather than an extremely elevated protein only  In fact  suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the spectrum of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the pathogenetic role of ferritin  Doubtlessly  improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better coping with severe diseases in terms of treatment and prevention of complications  The origin  history  importance  and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various pathological and clinical processes are presented hereby in our article  In addition  the implications of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883281
811,Case-based learning is a valuable tool to impart various problem-solving skills in veterinary education and stimulate active learning  Students can solve imaginary cases without the need for contact with real patients  Case-based teaching can be well performed as asynchronous remote-online class  In time of the COVID-19-pandemic  many courses in veterinary education are provided online  Therefore  students report certain fatigue when it comes to desk-based online learning  The app  Actionbound  provides a platform to design digitally interactive scavenger hunts based on global positioning system  GPS -called  bounds  -in which the teacher can create a case study with an authentic patient via narrative elements  This app was designed for multimedia-guided museum or city tours initially  The app offers the opportunity to send the students to different geographic localizations for example in a park or locations on the University campus  like geocaching  In this way  students can walk outdoors while solving the case study  The present article describes the first experience with Actionbound as a tool for mobile game-based and case-orientated learning in veterinary education  Three veterinary neurology cases were designed as bounds for undergraduate students  In the summer term 2020  42 students from the second to the fourth year of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover worked on these three cases  which were solved 88 times in total  Cases 1 and 2 were each played 30 times  and case 3 was played 28 times  Forty-seven bounds were solved from students walking through the forest with GPS  and 41 were managed indoors  After each bound  students evaluated the app and the course via a 6-point numerical Likert rating scale  1   excellent to 6   unsatisfactory   Students playing the bounds outdoors performed significantly better than students solving the corresponding bound at home in two of the three cases  p   0 01   The large majority of the students rated the course as excellent to good  median 1 35  range 1-4  and would recommend the course to friends  median 1 26  range 1-3   Summarizing  in teaching veterinary neurology Actionbound s game-based character in the context of outdoor activity motivates students  might improve learning  and is highly suitable for case-based learning,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993245
6646,Among the methods used to diagnose COVID-19  those based on genomic detection by q RT -PCR are the most sensitive  To perform these assays  a previous genome extraction of the sample is required  The dramatic increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2 detection assays has increased the demand for extraction reagents hindering the supply of commercial reagents  Homemade reagents and procedures could be an alternative  Nasopharyngeal samples were extracted by seven different methods as well as the automatic method MagNaPure96  to detect SARS-CoV-2  All protocols show sensitivity higher than 87    in comparison with reference method  for detecting SARS-CoV-2 as well as human beta- globin  Our results support that these procedures  using common and cheap reagents  are effective to extract RNA  from SARS-CoV-2  or DNA  from human beta-globin  genome from nasopharyngeal swabs  Furthermore  these procedures could be easily adopted by routine diagnostic laboratories to implement detection methods to help to fight against COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902458
3846,Despite the low rates of bacterial co- superinfections in COVID-19 patients  antimicrobial drug use has been liberal since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  Due to the low specificity of markers of bacterial co- superinfection in the COVID-19 setting  overdiagnosis and antimicrobial overprescription have become widespread  A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of urinary tract infection  UTI  diagnoses and antimicrobial drug prescriptions for UTI diagnoses was performed in patients admitted to the COVID-19 ward of a university hospital between 17 March and 2 November 2020  A team of infectious disease specialists performed an appropriateness evaluation for every diagnosis of UTI and every antimicrobial drug prescription covering a UTI  A driver analysis was performed to identify factors increasing the odds of UTI  over diagnosis  A total of 622 patients were included  UTI was present in 13  of included admissions  and in 12   antimicrobials were initiated for a UTI diagnosis  0 71 daily defined doses  DDDs  admission  22  were scored as  appropriate    An evaluation of UTI diagnoses by ID specialists revealed that of the 79 UTI diagnoses  61  were classified as probable overdiagnosis related to the COVID-19 hospitalization  The following factors were associated with UTI overdiagnosis  physicians who are unfamiliar working in an internal medicine ward  urinary incontinence  mechanical ventilation and female sex  Antimicrobial stewardship teams should focus on diagnostic stewardship of UTIs  as UTI overdiagnosis seems to be highly prevalent in admitted COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943705
8072,Athletes are advised to receive the COVID-19 vaccination to protect them from SARS CoV-2 infection during major competitions  Despite this  many athletes are reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis may impair athletic performance  OBJECTIVE  To determine the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise  METHODS  Healthy physically active participants completed a 20-minute bout of graded cycling exercise at intensities corresponding to 50  60  70 and 80  of the pre-determined VO2max before and  21 days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine  2 dose Pfizer mRNA or 1 dose Johnson Johnson   RESULTS  Vaccination had no effect on a large number of physiological responses to exercise measured in blood  e g  lactate  epinephrine  cortisol  and by respiratory gas exchange  e g  oxygen uptake  CO2 production  ventilation  respiratory exchange ratio  predicted VO2max  ventilatory threshold   p>0 05   We did  however  find significant elevations in heart rate   5 bpm  and norepinephrine  p   0 006 and 0 04  respectively  in response to vigorous  e g  70-80  VO2max  intensity exercise after vaccination  particularly in those that received the two shot Pfizer mRNA vaccine regimen  These findings held true when compared to demographically matched controls who completed identical bouts of exercise several weeks apart without receiving a vaccine  CONCLUSION  Recent COVID-19 vaccination has minimal effects on the physiological responses to graded exercise in physically active healthy people  The small elevations in cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to exercise after the Pfizer mRNA vaccine regimen could have implications for athletes at the elite level and warrants investigation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882029
7927,The Coronavirus Disease  COVID-19  pandemic is demanding the rapid action of the authorities and scientific community in order to find new antimicrobial solutions that could inactivate the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 that causes this disease  Gram-positive bacteria contribute to severe pneumonia associated with COVID-19  and their resistance to antibiotics is exponentially increasing  In this regard  non-woven fabrics are currently used for the fabrication of infection prevention clothing such as face masks  caps  scrubs  shirts  trousers  disposable gowns  overalls  hoods  aprons and shoe covers as protective tools against viral and bacterial infections  However  these non-woven fabrics are made of materials that do not exhibit intrinsic antimicrobial activity  Thus  we have here developed non-woven fabrics with antimicrobial coatings of cranberry extracts capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and the bacteriophage phi 6  about 99  of viral inactivation in 1 min of viral contact   and two multidrug-resistant bacteria  the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis  The morphology  thermal and mechanical properties of the produced filters were characterized by optical and electron microscopy  differential scanning calorimetry  thermogravimetry and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis  The non-toxicity of these advanced technologies was ensured using a Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model  These results open up a new prevention path using natural and biodegradable compounds for the fabrication of infection prevention clothing in the current COVID-19 pandemic and microbial resistant era,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884521
6390,PURPOSE  We report two cases of optic nerve pathology after the administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccines  respectively  and describe the implications for management of post-vaccination central nervous system  CNS  inflammation  CASE REPORTS  A 69-year-old woman presented with bilateral optic nerve head oedema  16 days after the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine  She was diagnosed with post-vaccination CNS inflammatory syndrome and was treated for five days with intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 gram per day  Her optic disc swelling improved  and her vision stabilised  A 32-year-old woman presented six days after her first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine with two days of sudden onset of progressive blurring of vision in her left eye  Posterior segment examination revealed left optic disc swelling  and an MRI of the brain  orbit  and cervical spine was significant for left optic nerve enhancement  The patient was diagnosed with a unilateral post-vaccination optic neuritis  She was treated with a three-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone  Her optic disc swelling and visual field improved  and she recovered 6 6 vision  CONCLUSIONS  Clinicians and patients should be aware of the potential for post-vaccination CNS inflammatory syndromes associated with COVID-19 vaccine administration  Neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may aid in the diagnosis of the cause of vision loss  Further studies are needed to evaluate the spectrum and frequency of optic nerve involvement associated with COVID-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906029
565,Even though the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a historical challenge  science has had an exponential development  and the current vaccination campaigns are proof of this  Unfortunately  along came misinformation and myths regarding their production and their adverse effects  For this reason  we have considered of utter importance to review anaphylaxis  one of the most feared vaccine adverse events Anaphylaxis can be defined as a life-threatening acute and systemic allergic reaction  with a wide clinical spectrum  which can be explained by many immunological mechanisms  and whose diagnostic complexity demands the fulfillment of strict criteria  Though infrequent  any vaccine has the potential to trigger anaphylaxis  In the United States  for the new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  rates from 1 200 000  Pfizer-BioNTech  to 1 360 000 doses  Moderna  have been estimated  Vaccine adverse events can be mediated by hypersensitivity reactions  either allergic or not  Unlike a typical drug allergy  rarely is the active ingredient responsible for the reaction  Therefore  excipients must be considered during the approach to this problem  Vaccine associated anaphylaxis has to be referred to an allergist so as to guarantee the maximum benefit for the patient and improve the vaccines  security profile,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34998305

1173,During coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  the genetic mutations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  occurred frequently  Some mutations in the spike protein are considered to promote transmissibility of the virus  while the mutation patterns in other proteins are less studied and may also be important in understanding the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2  We used the sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 strains in California to investigate the time-varying patterns of the evolutionary genetic distance  The accumulative genetic distances were quantified across different time periods and in different viral proteins  The increasing trends of genetic distance were observed in spike protein  S protein   the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp  region and nonstructural protein 3  nsp3  of open reading frame 1  ORF1   and nucleocapsid protein  N protein   The genetic distances in ORF3a  ORF8  and nsp2 of ORF1 started to diverge from their original variants after September 2020  By contrast  mutations in other proteins appeared transiently  and no evident increasing trend was observed in the genetic distance to the original variants  This study presents distinct patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 mutations across multiple proteins from the aspect of genetic distance  Future investigation shall be conducted to study the effects of accumulative mutations on epidemics characteristics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986485
6492,In March 2020  the World Health Organization  WHO  declared COVID-19 a global pandemic  Given that keeping abreast of international perspectives and research results is of particular importance for such massive global emergencies  we employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of international psychological research addressing this important early phase of the pandemic  We included a total of 79 studies  with data mostly collected between March and June 2020  This review aimed to systematically identify and map the nature and scope of international studies examining psychological aspects of the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic  We mapped key research themes  subfields of psychology  the nature and extent of international research collaboration  data methods employed  and challenges and enablers faced by psychological researchers in the early stages of the pandemic  Among the wide range of themes covered  mental health and social behaviours were the key themes  Most studies were in clinical health psychology and social psychology  Network analyses revealed how authors collaborated and to what extent the studies were international  Europe and the United States were often at the centre of international collaboration  The predominant study design was cross-sectional and online with quantitative analyses  We also summarised author reported critical challenges and enablers for international psychological research during the COVID pandemic  and conclude with implications for the field of psychology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904220
8116,The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health threat of serious concern  especially in conflict settings that face fragility and lack adequate resources and capacities  Gaza suffers from a blockade imposed by the Israeli occupation  environmental deterioration  confiscation of lands  demolition of houses and hospitals  restrictions on movement  lack of control over natural resources  and financial constraints  Gaza s population is consequently living in a poor humanitarian situation with high unemployment rates  poverty  over-crowdedness  and a weak health system  This makes Gaza incredibly fragile and affects its ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic effectively  The pandemic is expected to deepen Gaza s systems  fragility  which is already overstretched beyond their limits  This will hinder its capacity to deal with the pandemic  and other pre-existing pressing humanitarian needs  Therefore  in this review  we comprehensively explored Gaza s policy failures and successes related to the COVID-19 preparedness and response by state and non-state actors and recommend potential solutions and alternatives  We have addressed critical issues including the health system  water  sanitation  hygiene  socio-economic  education  food security  and others  In Gaza  effectiveness in combating the COVID-19 pandemic can only come from committed political will  transparency from all regulators  strategic dialogue  comprehensive planning  and active international support,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881218
8229,BACKGROUND  After recovery from acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   many patients experience long-term symptoms in different body systems  The aim of the present study was to identify these symptoms  their severity  and their duration as a first step in building a system to classify post-recovery long-term symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   METHODS  An online-based cross-sectional survey was administered between September and October 2020  Data regarding the severity of post-recovery symptoms and their duration were collected using an Arabic questionnaire divided into six categories encompassing the 20 most prevalent symptoms  RESULTS  A total of 979 patients recovered from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia in the study period  of whom 53  were male and 47  were female  The most common symptoms included general fatigue and weakness  73  each   with moderate severity of neurological symptoms including mood changes  41   and insomnia  39    Among the special senses  loss of smell and taste of marked severity were reported by 64  and 55  among respiratory symptoms  cough of mild severity  47    and dyspnea of moderate severity  43    Loss of appetite of moderate severity was reported in 42   and diarrhea  abdominal pain  and nausea of mild severity were reported by 53   50   and 44  of respondents  respectively  CONCLUSIONS  Long-term symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 warrant patient follow-up  The authors propose a classification system as a starting point to guide the identification and follow-up of long-term symptoms post-recovery  and recommend larger-scale studies to broaden the definition of recovery from COVID-19  which appears to have two phases  acute and chronic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879074
8826,Efficient COVID-19 vaccines are widely acknowledged as the best way to end the global pandemic  SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain  RBD  plays fundamental roles related to cell infection  Antibodies could be developed to target RBD and represent a potential approach for the neutralization of the virus  Epitopes used to produce antibodies are generally linear peptides and thus possess multiple confirmations that do not reflect the actual topology of the targeted part in the native protein  On the other hand  macrocyclic epitopes could constitute closer mimics of the native protein topology and  as such  could generate superior antibodies  In this study  we demonstrated the vital effect of the size and the three-dimensional shape of epitopes on the activity of the developed antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV-2  The molecular dynamics studies showed the greater stability of the cyclic epitopes compared with the linear counterparts  which was reflected in the affinity of the produced antibodies  The antibodies developed using macrocyclic epitopes showed superiority with respect to binding to RBD compared to antibodies formed from linear peptides  This study constitutes a roadmap for developing superior antibodies that could be used to inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34869973
7182,BACKGROUND  Antibacterial prescribing for respiratory tract infections  RTIs  accounts for almost half of all prescribing in primary care  Nearly a quarter of antibacterial prescribing in primary care is estimated to be inappropriate  the greatest being for RTIs  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the provision of healthcare services and impacted the levels of antibacterials prescribed  OBJECTIVES  To describe the changes in community antibacterial prescribing for RTIs in winter 2020-21 in England  METHODS  RTI antibacterial prescribing was measured in prescription items 1000 population for primary care from January 2014 and in DDDs 1000 population day for the totality of RTI prescribing  combined with Accident   Emergency  A E  in secondary care   from January 2016 to February 2021  Trends were assessed using negative binomial regression and seasonally adjusted interrupted time-series analysis  RESULTS  Antibacterials prescribed for RTIs reduced by a further 12 4  per season compared with pre-COVID  P < 0 001   In winter 2020-21  RTI prescriptions almost halved compared with the previous winter in 2019-20  P < 0 001   The trend observed for total RTI prescribing  primary care with A E  was similar to that observed in the community alone  CONCLUSIONS  During COVID-19  RTI prescribing reduced in the community and the expected rise in winter was not seen in 2020-21  We found no evidence that RTI prescribing shifted from primary care to A E in secondary care  The most likely explanation is a decrease in RTIs and presentations to primary care associated with national prevention measures for COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897486

4689,A novel approach combining time series analysis and complex network theory is proposed to deeply explore characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic in some parts of the United States  US   It merges as a new way to provide a systematic view and complementary information of COVID-19 progression in the US  enabling evidence-based responses towards pandemic intervention and prevention  To begin with  the Principal Component Analysis  PCA  varimax is adopted to fuse observed time-series data about the pandemic evolution in each state across the US  Then  relationships between the pandemic progress of two individual states are measured by different synchrony metrics  which can then be mapped into networks under unique topological characteristics  Lastly  the hidden knowledge in the established networks can be revealed from different perspectives by network structure measurement  community detection  and online random forest  which helps to inform data-driven decisions for battling the pandemic  It has been found that states gathered in the same community by diffusion entropy reducer  DER  are prone to be geographically close and share a similar pattern and tendency of COVID-19 evolution  Social factors regarding the political party  Gross Domestic Product  GDP   and population density are possible to be significantly associated with the two detected communities within a constructed network  Moreover  the cluster-specific predictor based on online random forest and sliding window is proven useful in dynamically capturing and predicting the epidemiological trends for each community  which can reach the highest,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931157
9187,An infodemic caused by a rampant spread of a mixture of correct and incorrect information in a connected world creates uncertainty about and dismissal of proven public health measures  Two key factors that can influence COVID-19 preventive behaviors are information and self-efficacy  Misinformation  inaccurate or misleading information  can modify people s attitudes and behaviors and deter them from following preventive behaviors  Self-efficacy  on the other hand  has been linked to the likelihood to engaging in preventive behaviors  This cross-sectional study used a nationally representative survey of Americans from 2020 to determine the associations between  1  COVID-19 news sources and COVID-19 misinformation and  2  COVID-19 misinformation and COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy  using multivariable logistic regression  Results indicate that reliance on conservative sources for COVID-19 news is significantly associated with endorsing COVID-19 misinformation  In contrast  reliance on liberal sources  mainstream print  or social media for COVID-19 news are significantly negatively associated with endorsing COVID-19 misinformation  Furthermore  endorsing COVID-19 misinformation is related to low COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy  which  in turn  can modify COVID-19 preventive behaviors  These findings suggest that customizing health messages to debunk misinformation and increase self-efficacy for preventive behaviors can motivate individuals to comply with preventive behaviors and protect themselves from COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865604
2848,OBJECTIVE  The study was designed to compare intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccination by race-ethnicity  to identify beliefs that may mediate the association between race-ethnicity and intention to receive the vaccine and to identify the demographic factors and beliefs most strongly predictive of intention to receive a vaccine  DESIGN  Cross-sectional survey conducted from November 2020 to January 2021  nested within a longitudinal cohort study of the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among a general population-based sample of adults in six San Francisco Bay Area counties  called TrackCOVID   Study Cohort  In total  3161 participants among the 3935 in the TrackCOVID parent cohort responded  RESULTS  Rates of high vaccine willingness were significantly lower among Black  41    Latinx  55    Asian  58    Multi-racial  59    and Other race  58   respondents than among White respondents  72    Black  Latinx  and Asian respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents to endorse lack of trust of government and health agencies as a reason not to get vaccinated  Participants  motivations and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination only partially explained racial-ethnic differences in vaccination willingness  Concerns about a rushed government vaccine approval process and potential bad reactions to the vaccine were the two most important factors predicting vaccination intention  CONCLUSIONS  Vaccine outreach campaigns must ensure that the disproportionate toll of COVID-19 on historically marginalized racial-ethnic communities is not compounded by inequities in vaccination  Efforts must emphasize messages that speak to the motivations and concerns of groups suffering most from health inequities to earn their trust to support informed decision making,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960152
6954,Research Summary  We examine changes in help-seeking for domestic violence  DV  in seven U S  cities during the COVID-19 pandemic  Using Bayesian structural time-series modeling with daily data to construct a synthetic counterfactual  we test whether calls to police and or emergency hotlines varied in 2020 as people stayed home due to COVID-19  Across this sample  we estimate there were approximately 1030 more calls to police and 1671 more calls to emergency hotlines than would have occurred absent the pandemic  Policy Implications  Interagency data sharing and analysis holds great promise for better understanding localized trends in DV in real time  Research-practitioner partnerships can help DV coordinated community response teams  CCRTs  develop accessible and sustainable dashboards to visualize data and advance community transparency  As calls for drastic changes in policing are realized  prioritization of finite resources will become critical  Data-driven decision-making by CCRTs provides an opportunity to work within resource constraints without compromising the safety of DV victims,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899092
5639,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic  as well as efforts to prevent its spread  have had a strong impact on the delivery of rehabilitative services in Germany  While several studies have addressed the impact of these developments on health service providers and COVID-19 patients  little is known about its impact on patients in need of rehabilitative treatment because of other conditions  This study aims to identify expectations  concerns and experiences of rehabilitation patients related to service delivery in this situation  METHODS  Using a qualitative study design  user posts from six German online forums between March and Mid-November 2020 were systematically searched with respect to experiences  concerns and expectations of health care users toward receiving rehabilitative treatment  We used qualitative content analysis with inductive coding as our methodological approach  RESULTS  Users fearing physical or psychological impairment were concerned about not receiving timely or effective treatment due to closed hospitals  reduced treatments and limited admissions  In contrast  patients more concerned about getting infected with COVID-19 worried about the effectiveness of protective measures and being denied postponement of treatment by the funding bodies  During their stay  some patients reported feeling isolated due to contact restrictions and did not feel their treatment was effective  while others reported being satisfied and praised hospitals for their efforts to ensure the safety of the patients  Many patients reported communication problems before and during their treatment  including concerns about the safety and effectiveness of their treatment  as well as financial concerns and worries about future treatments  Several users felt that their concerns were disregarded by the hospitals and the funding bodies  leaving them feeling distressed  insecure and dissatisfied  CONCLUSIONS  While some users report only minor concerns related to the pandemic and its impact on rehabilitation  others report strong concerns relating not only to their own health and safety  but also to financial aspects and their ability to work  Many users feel ignored and disregarded  showing a strong need for more coordinated strategies and improved communication specifically with funding bodies like health insurance companies and the German pension funds,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915890
2317,ABSTRACT  To investigate the mental health status of obstetric nurses and its influencing factors during the novel coronavirus epidemic period  so as to provide theoretical reference for hospital decision-makers and managers From February 25 to March 20  2020  we conducted a cross-sectional survey through online questionnaire  and selected obstetric nurses from Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces as the research objects by convenience sampling Three hundred eighteen valid questionnaires were collected  the results of Symptom Checklist 90 showed that the scores of  obsessive-compulsive    depression    anxiety    hostility    phobia   and  psychosis  were higher than the Chinese norm  P <  01   There were 107 people whose total score of Symptom Checklist 90 was more than 160  and 83 people whose number of positive items was more than 43  Logistic regression results showed that married  temporary employment  lack of support and communication from family and relatives  onerous task  and unbearable responsibility were independent risk factors for mental disorder There is a great psychological burden for obstetric nurses during the epidemic period  Decision makers should focus on necessary psychological intervention for those that are married  temporarily employed  and those lacking family supports including communication  At the same time  managers should distribute tasks reasonably to avoid psychological burdens caused by overwork,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967352
7374,INTRODUCTION  In the era of data-driven decision-making  unacceptable haziness  and inconsistency surrounds the yearlong scientific and public debate on the school closure policy in the coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19  pandemic mitigation efforts  AIM  The present literature review stems out of the need for a clear scaffold collecting in one place all current evidence  as well as helping to organize incoming future evidence  concerning both the role of schools in driving the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  community spread and the cost-effectiveness of school closure in containing such spread  METHODS  References for this review were initially identified through searches of PubMed  Scopus  and Cochrane Library for articles published from March 2020 to March 2021 by the use of key terms  Schools    COVID-19    pandemic    clusters    outbreak   and  seroprevalence   selecting all articles from 2020 to 2021 with full-text availability  A further search was undertaken by screening citations of articles found in the original search and through Google Scholar and ResearchGate  RESULTS  Overall  evidence shows that opening schools and keeping them open in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is possible  although behaviorally challenging and unfeasible if educational facilities or testing services are inadequate  Contrary to other respiratory viruses  children are not chief targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection  transmission  and disease  It also appears that the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in the WHO European region has been unrelated to school re-opening  CONCLUSIONS  A fact-based understanding of what is currently known on such a consequential policy is required to provide a basis of evidence for advocacy of either school closure or school opening at times of high-intensity community transmission of SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894111
7801,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased levels of stress and alcohol consumption  This study examined the effect of resilience on the relationship between stress and changes in alcohol consumption in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020  A cross-sectional survey of 502 adults in Queensland  Australia  mean age   45 68  16 61    found 23 9  of individuals had increased their alcohol consumption since the start of the pandemic  Regression modelling demonstrated a significant association between perceived stress and change in alcohol consumption  The study also revealed resilience was a moderating factor  where high levels of resilience buffered against increases in alcohol consumption associated with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886691
9917,We present the case of a female teenager who sustained nitrous oxide burns to the medial aspect of both thighs from contact with a nitrous oxide canister being used to fill balloons  There was a delay in presentation as the injury was not initially recognised  These burns were initially assessed as being superficial partial-thickness burns but took a prolonged time to heal despite regular wound care  This was complicated by a lack of adherence to recommended treatment for much of the patient care as well as the patient testing positive for COVID-19 during their management  which prevented surgery and significantly extended time to healing  While small numbers of similar cases have been previously described this is the first reported case outside of the Netherlands and in a child  Being aware of such cases ensures early referral to specialist burn care for appropriate management to give patients the best possible outcome,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853051
2957,An 84-year-old male patient with no known comorbidity was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of dyspnea and respiratory distress  The patient was referred to the COVID outpatient clinic  laboratory and radiology tests were performed  Thoracic CT scan of the patient showed large peripheral patchy ground glass densities observed in the lower lobes of both lungs  CT imaging findings were evaluated by an experienced radiologist and reported as COVID-19 pneumonia  The patient  who was self-isolated at home for 5 days  presented to the emergency department again on the fifth day with complaints of respiratory distress  fever  bruising with cough  and loss of peripheral pulse in the left lower extremity  Necessary tests were performed on the patient  An above-knee amputation was performed when a diagnosis of limb ischemic necrosis was made and no revascularization attempt was considered by the CVS department  This case study describes the coexistence of sudden lower extremity thrombosis and Covid-19 in our case without a known chronic disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958256
3153,We present a storytelling robot  controlled via the ACT-R cognitive architecture  able to adopt different persuasive techniques and ethical stances while conversing about some topics concerning COVID-19  The main contribution of the paper consists in the proposal of a needs-driven model that guides and evaluates  during the dialogue  the use  if any  of persuasive techniques available in the agent procedural memory  The portfolio of persuasive techniques tested in such a model ranges from the use of storytelling to framing techniques and rhetorical-based arguments  To the best of our knowledge  this represents the first attempt of building a persuasive agent able to integrate a mix of explicitly grounded cognitive assumptions about dialogue management  storytelling and persuasive techniques as well as ethical attitudes  The paper presents the results of an exploratory evaluation of the system on 63 participants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956417
7945,The most common arrhythmia associated with COronaVIrus-related Disease  COVID  infection is sinus tachycardia  It is not known if high Heart Rate  HR  in COVID is simply a marker of higher systemic response to sepsis or if its persistence could be related to a long-term autonomic dysfunction  The aim of our work is to assess the prevalence of elevated HR at discharge in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and to evaluate the variables associated with it  We enrolled 697 cases of SARS-CoV2 infection admitted in our hospital after February 21 and discharged within 23 July 2020  We collected data on clinical history  vital signs  laboratory tests and pharmacological treatment  Severe disease was defined as the need for Intensive Care Unit  ICU  admission and or mechanical ventilation  Median age was 59 years  first-third quartile 49  74   and male was the prevalent gender  60 1    84 6  of the subjects showed a SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia  and 13 2  resulted in a severe disease  Mean HR at admission was 90   - 18 bpm with a mean decrease of 10 bpm to discharge  Only 5 5  of subjects presented HR > 100 bpm at discharge  Significant predictors of discharge HR at multiple linear model were admission HR  mean increase   beta   0 17 per bpm  95  CI 0 11  0 22  p < 0 001   haemoglobin  beta   -0 64 per g dL  95  CI -1 19  -0 09  p   0 023  and severe disease  beta   8 42  95  CI 5 39  11 45  p < 0 001   High HR at discharge in COVID-19 patients is not such a frequent consequence  but when it occurs it seems strongly related to a severe course of the disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884293
6123,Data from the Istituto Superiore di Sanita  ISS  emphasized by the media indicate that COVID-19 vaccination reduces related infections  hospitalizations and deaths  However  a comparison showed significantly more hospitalizations and intensive care unit accesses in the corresponding months and days in 2021 versus 2020 and no significant differences in deaths  The combination of non-alternative hypotheses may help explain the discrepancy between the results in the entire population and the vaccination s success claimed by the ISS in reducing infections  serious cases and deaths  a bias  counting as unvaccinated also  those vaccinated with 1 dose in the two weeks following the inoculation   and as incompletely vaccinated also  those vaccinated with 2 doses within two weeks of the 2nd inoculation  a systematic error  counting as unvaccinated also  vaccinated with 1 dose in the two weeks following the inoculation   and as incompletely vaccinated also  vaccinated with 2 doses within two weeks of the 2nd inoculation   Many reports show an increase in COVID-19 cases in these time-windows  and related data should be separated levels of protective effectiveness in vaccinated people  often considered stable  actually show signs of progressive reduction over time  which could contribute to reducing the overall population resultunvaccinated people show more severe disease than in 2020  supporting also in humans the theory of imperfect vaccines  which offer less resistance to the entry of germs than the resistance later encountered inside the human body  This favors the selection of more resistant and virulent mutants  that can be spread by vaccinated people  This damages first the unvaccinated people  but ultimately the whole community  An open scientific debate is needed to discuss these hypotheses  following the available evidence  as well as to discuss the inconsistent theory of unvaccinated young people as reservoirs of viruses mutants   to assess the long-term and community impact of different vaccination strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909193
8663,BACKGROUND  Antibody response following SARS-CoV2 vaccination is somewhat defective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  CLL   Moreover  the correlation between serologic response and status of cellular immunity has been poorly studied  OBJECTIVE  This study was undertaken to assess humoral immune and cellular responses to the BNT162b2 messenger RNA  mRNA  COVID-19 vaccination in CLL  METHODS  The presence of the spike antibodies was assessed at a median time of 14 days from the second vaccine dose of SARS-CoV2 in 70 CLL followed-up at a single institution  RESULTS  The antibody response rate  RR  in CLL patients was 58 5   compared to 100  of 57 healthy controls of the same sex and age  P< 0 0001   Patients treatment-naive and those in sustained clinical remission after therapy had the highest RR  87 0  and 87 7   respectively   In contrast  patients on therapy with a pathway inhibitor as monotherapy and those treated with an association of anti-CD20 antibody were unlikely to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  52  and 10   respectively   In multivariate analysis  early Rai stage  OR  0 19  0 05-0 79   P 0 02  and no previous therapy  OR  0 06 0 02-0 27   P<0 0001  were found to be independent predictors of vaccination response  An increase in absolute NK cells  i e   CD16 CD56 positive cells  in patients with a serological response was found following the second dose of vaccine  P 0 02   CONCLUSIONS  These results confirm that serological response to the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with CLL is impaired  A third boosting vaccine dosage should be considered for these patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872098
6001,OBJECTIVE  This research was carried out to evaluate people s knowledge of adult vaccination and their attitude and to observe the effect of the pandemic era on this situation  METHODS  A total of 1 425 people  18-80 years old  were included in this study  The types of questions like the province where they live  age  gender  occupation  education status  and the presence of chronic diseases  as well as knowing which vaccines are used in adult vaccination  which of these vaccines they had in the last 10 years  which ones they plan to have this year  and whether COVID-19 pandemic changed their perspective on adult vaccinations or not were asked to people  RESULTS  In the last 10 years  while participants stated that they had the highest rate of tetanus vaccine with 29 8   hepatitis B vaccine with 23 1   influenza vaccine with 22 7   human papillomavirus vaccine with 1 3   and zoster vaccine with 0 3  were the lowest levels of vaccines  CONCLUSIONS  As a result  it seems that we are far from the goals set by the health authorities for adult vaccination  We observed that the COVID-19 pandemic raised awareness toward pneumococcus and influenza vaccines and interest toward adult vaccinations and at the same time changed the thoughts against adult vaccinations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909884
1142,BACKGROUND  Knowledge of the clinical course and consequences of COVID-19 initially evolved in the context of severe presentations and among those with comorbidities  However  understanding the outcomes of milder infections in healthy individuals is important for safe return-to-duty in extreme environments or to occupations requiring significant fitness  We reviewed the literature to characterize the nature and timing of persistent and emergent clinical sequelae in milder COVID-19 cases to facilitate development of post-COVID-19 screening and surveillance protocols METHODS  We searched databases including EMBASE  MEDLINE  Cochrane COVID-19 study register  gray literature  clinical trial registries  and relevant health and disease prevention sources for publications from 2019 to February 18 th   2021  documenting COVID-19 sequelae  Articles were included if the COVID-19 severity was mild and there were no  or only minor  pre-existing comorbidities  Persistent and emergent sequelae were then stratified based on time since diagnosis RESULTS  Among those with mild COVID-19  sequelae were shown to emerge or persist for months following presumed recovery  Among those with no comorbidities  cardiac  hematological  and respiratory sequelae emerged after 1-2 mo  and primarily cardiac abnormalities persisted at >   3 mo  Among those with minor comorbidities  persistent respiratory abnormalities  fatigue  dyspnea  and headache were common  and mental health symptoms emerged by 1-2 mo postinfection DISCUSSION  After presumed recovery from mild COVID-19  a range of symptoms can persist and later emerge  Whether these are new or previously unrecognized is unclear  Under-recognized COVID-19 sequelae may increase the risk of subtle or sudden incapacitation and have implications for return-to-work  RTW  screening and surveillance for safety-critical roles Tucci V  Saary J  Persistent and emergent clinical sequelae of mild COVID-19  Aerosp Med Hum Perform  2021  92 12  962-969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986935
6715,While COVID-19 is ravaging the lives of millions of people across the globe  a second pandemic  black fungus  has surfaced robbing people of their lives especially people who are recovering from coronavirus  Thus  the objective of this article is to analyze public perceptions through sentiment analysis regarding black fungus during the COVID-19 pandemic  To attain the objective  first  a support vector machine  SVM  model  with an average AUC of 82 75   was developed to classify user sentiments in terms of anger  fear  joy  and sad  Next  this SVM model was used to predict the class labels of the public tweets  n   6477  related to COVID-19 and black fungus  As outcome  this article found public perceptions towards black fungus during COVID-19 pandemic belong mostly to sad  n  2370  36 59    followed by joy  n   2095  32 34    fear  n   1914  29 55   and anger  n   98  1 51    This article also found that public perceptions are varied to some critical concerns like education  lockdown  hospital  oxygen  quarantine  and vaccine  For example  people mostly exhibited fear in social media about education  hospital  vaccine while some people expressed joy about education  hospital  vaccine  and oxygen  Again  it was found that mass people have an ignorance tendency to lockdown  COVID-19 restrictions  and prescribed hygiene rules although the coronavirus and black fungus infection rates broke the previous infection records,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901767

3032,Twitter data exhibits several dimensions worth exploring  a network dimension in the form of links between the users  textual content of the tweets posted  and a temporal dimension as the time-stamped sequence of tweets and their retweets  In the paper  we combine analyses along all three dimensions  temporal evolution of retweet networks and communities  contents in terms of hate speech  and discussion topics  We apply the methods to a comprehensive set of all Slovenian tweets collected in the years 2018-2020  We find that politics and ideology are the prevailing topics despite the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic  These two topics also attract the highest proportion of unacceptable tweets  Through time  the membership of retweet communities changes  but their topic distribution remains remarkably stable  Some retweet communities are strongly linked by external retweet influence and form super-communities  The super-community membership closely corresponds to the topic distribution  communities from the same super-community are very similar by the topic distribution  and communities from different super-communities are quite different in terms of discussion topics  However  we also find that even communities from the same super-community differ considerably in the proportion of unacceptable tweets they post,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957317
9044,The global COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the shortcomings of our health  social  and economic systems  While responding to the health crisis  governments are scrambling to understand and address the knock-on economic effects from market disruptions  and respond to other major disturbances  e g  natural disasters   We conducted 61 key informant interviews with Indo-Fijian small-scale fisheries  SSF  actors  i e  fishers  boat owners  that may or may not fish   crew members  and traders  in May 2020  two months after Fiji got its first case of COVID-19 and a month after Cyclone Harold hit the country  We examined how these SSF groups whose access to resources depends on their ability to navigate existing social relations of power  have lived through  experienced  and responded to the two stresses  We found the main impact of COVID-19 on SSF actors was the reduction in sales of fish  73 8   of respondents  likely a result of reduction in local consumption and or the loss of tourism markets  Loss of purchasing power meant almost a fifth of Indo-Fijian SSF actors interviewed  comprising 44 4   of crew members  16 4   fishers  11 5   boat owners  8 3   traders  were unable to obtain sufficient food to meet their families  daily needs  Many of these SSF actors do not have access to social security or similar safety nets leaving them vulnerable to the current crisis as well as to other shocks and changes  Furthermore  social inequities and power relations surrounding access to fisheries resources and government aid contributed to their vulnerability to economic stresses from COVID-19 and a severe cyclone  An understanding of early impacts of COVID-19 on SSF through an intersectional lens can assist decision-makers to quickly mobilise assistance to help people who are most vulnerable  and avoid widening inequities among social groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867082
2518,Introduction  Worldwide mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2  while having been the most critical action in combating further waves of COVID-19  was initially fraught with multiple infrastructural and socio-cultural challenges  Vaccine hesitancy  a phenomenon of doubt over the vaccines  claimed efficacy and or safety amidst access to vaccination  emerged as a major challenge for global health  despite approval and regular post-marketing surveillance by major regulatory bodies  Methods  We reviewed the literature related to vaccine hesitancy in India published until November 14  2021 using relevant keywords in various databases and examined it from a bioethical perspective  Results  Factors driving hesitancy either intensified skepticism towards vaccination in general or exacerbated reluctance towards specific vaccines  In India  hesitancy towards indigenously developed vaccines was aggravated by the lack of peer-reviewed phase III trial data before the start of vaccination  lack of public transparency of regulatory bodies  and presence of public perception of inappropriately expedited processes  This perspective piece discusses the state of mass immunization in India as a case of how vaccination and its hesitancy thereof gave rise to unique bioethical challenges in global health  In early 2021  vaccination in India was subject to difficulties in adhering to the principles of equity and justice  while a compromise of the principles of informed consent  beneficence  and non-maleficence also perhaps did occur  Conclusions  Post-pandemic debriefing on the subversion of bioethical principles will be needed  and an appropriate response may be required to rebuild and enhance the public faith in future mass vaccination movements,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963880
288,The COVID-19 pandemic has produced alterations in the behaviour and psychological health of people  who have had to learn living under uncertain circumstances escaping their control  This situation has been aggravated in those countries applying strict home confinement rules to try bending their epidemic curve  This is the case of Spain  where the stringent lockdown period was extended over three months  This study aimed at proving a research hypothesis whereby living close to Green Infrastructure  GI  during the confinement period was beneficial for mental health  To this end  La Palma  Canary Islands  and Zaragoza  Peninsular Spain  were taken as case studies  since both locations distributed a questionnaire to address citizenry s self-reported mental health under strict lockdown conditions  A spatial statistical analysis of the responses collected by these questionnaires revealed that variables such as stress  anger  medication use  alcohol consumption or visits to the doctor significantly decreased if citizens were close to GI  whereas people having very high expectations of enjoying the city after the confinement were positively correlated to proximity of green areas  Although these outcomes are limited by the inferential capacity of correlation analysis  they point out to a sense of relief derived from having visual contact with vegetated landscapes and feeling stimulated about using them for recreation  aesthetical or sporting purposes  The joint consideration of these psychological gains with the social and environmental benefits provided by GI emphasizes the importance of approaching urban regeneration through the design and implementation of interconnected green spaces,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002595
8681,BACKGROUND  Strict isolation precautions limit formal echocardiogram use in the setting of COVID-19 infection  Information on the importance of the utilization of a hand-held focused ultrasound for cardiac evaluation in these patients is scarce  This study investigated the utility of a hand-held echocardiogram device in COVID-19 hospitalized patients in diagnosing cardiac pathologies and predicting the composite endpoint of in-hospital death  mechanical ventilation  shock  and acute decompensated heart failure  METHODS  From April 28 th  through July 27 th   2020  consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent evaluation using a hand-held ultrasound  Vscan Extend with Dual Probe  GE Healthcare  within 48-h of admission  The patients were divided into two groups   Normal  and  Abnormal   as defined by biventricular systolic dysfunction enlargement  or moderate severe valvular regurgitation stenosis  echocardiogram study  RESULTS  Among 102 patients  26  25 5   had an abnormal study  They were older  with more co-morbidities  and more severe presenting symptoms  as compared to the group with a normal echocardiogram  The prevalence of the composite outcome among low- and high-risk patients  oxygen saturation <94   was 3 1  and 27 1   respectively  Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that an abnormal echocardiogram at presentation was independently associated with the composite endpoint  OR 6 19  95  CI 1 50-25 57  p 0 012   CONCLUSIONS  An abnormal echocardiogram in COVID-19 infection settings is associated with a higher burden of medical comorbidities and independently predict major adverse endpoints  Hand-held focused echocardiogram can be utilized as an important  rule-out  tool among high-risk COVID-19 patients and should be integrated into their routine admission evaluation  However  its routine utilization among low-risk patients is not recommended,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871728
8483,Structural characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 full length nsp1 protein will be an essential tool for developing new target-directed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and for further understanding of intra- and intermolecular interactions of this protein  As a first step in the NMR studies of the protein  we report the 1H  13C and 15N resonance backbone assignment as well as the Cbeta of the apo form of the full-lengthSARS-CoV-2 nsp1 including the folded domain together with the flaking N- and C- terminal intrinsically disordered fragments  The 19 8 kD protein was characterized by high-resolution NMR  Validation of assignment have been done by using two different mutants  H81P and K129E D48E as well as by amino acid specific experiments  According to the obtained assignment  the secondary structure of the folded domain in solution was almost identical to its previously published X-ray structure as well as another published secondary structure obtained by NMR  but some discrepancies have been detected  In the solution SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 exhibited disordered  flexible N- and C-termini with different dynamic characteristics  The short peptide in the beginning of the disordered C-terminal domain adopted two different conformations distinguishable on the NMR time scale  We propose that the disordered and folded nsp1 domains are not fully independent units but are rather involved in intramolecular interactions  Studies of the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant in solution are on-going and will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874953
5781,The COVID-19 pandemic has created new challenges for management of pleural diseases  As resources and staff have been redirected to manage acutely unwell COVID-19 patients  routine medical practice and service provision for pleural diseases have been severely disrupted  We recognised the impact this had for patients with pleural diseases  who can be highly vulnerable to infection and often have conditions for which treatment cannot be safely delayed  The pleural service was reviewed in a tertiary centre  focusing on the changes that allowed maintenance of a service whilst maximising patient and staff safety  with the aim that these service transformations can be adopted elsewhere to improve care for pleural patients during and beyond COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913397
2236,SARS-CoV-2 Lambda  a variant of interest  has spread in some South American countries  however  its virological features and evolutionary traits remain unclear  In this study  we use pseudoviruses and reveal that the spike protein of the Lambda variant is more infectious than that of other variants due to the T76I and L452Q mutations  The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation  a unique 7-amino acid deletion in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda spike protein  is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies and further augments antibody-mediated enhancement of infection  Although this mutation generates a nascent N-linked glycosylation site  the additional N-linked glycan is dispensable for the virological property conferred by this mutation  Since the Lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation  our data suggest that the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the substantial spread of the Lambda variant in South America,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968415
2351,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has rapidly spread all over the world with a very high rate of mortality  Different symptoms developed by COVID-19 infection and its impacts on various organs of the human body have highlighted the importance of both coinfections and superinfections with other pathogens  The gastrointestinal  GI  tract is vulnerable to infection with COVID-19 and can be exploited as an alternative transmission route and target for virus entry and pathogenesis  The GI manifestations of COVID-19 disease are associated with severe disease outcomes and death in all age groups  in particular  elderly patients  Empiric antibiotic treatments for microbial infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in addition to experimental antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs may increase the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea  AAD  and Clostridioides difficile infection  CDI   Alterations of gut microbiota are associated with depletion of beneficial commensals and enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as C  difficile  Hence  the main purpose of this review is to explain the likely risk factors contributing to higher incidence of CDI in patients with COVID-19  In addition to lung involvement  common symptoms observed in COVID-19 and CDI such as diarrhea  highlight the significance of bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients  In particular  hospitalized elderly patients who are receiving antibiotics might be more prone to CDI  Indeed  widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as clindamycin  cephalosporins  penicillin  and fluoroquinolones can affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota of patients with COVID-19  leading to reduced colonization resistance capacity against opportunistic pathogens such as C  difficile  and subsequently develop CDI  Moreover  patients with CDI possibly may have facilitated the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in their feces for approximately one month  even though the nasopharyngeal test turned negative  This coinfection may increase the potential transmissibility of both SARS-CoV-2 and C  difficile by fecal materials  Also  CDI can complicate the outcome of COVID-19 patients  especially in the presence of comorbidities or for those patients with prior exposure to the healthcare setting  Finally  physicians should remain vigilant for possible SARS-CoV-2 and CDI coinfection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the excessive use of antimicrobials and biocides,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966759

871,BACKGROUND  The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology  ESGO  and partners are committed to improving the training for gynecologic oncology fellows  The aim of this survey was to assess the type and level of training in cervical cancer surgery and to investigate whether the Laparoscopic Approach to Cervical Cancer  LACC  trial results impacted training in radical surgery for gynecologic oncology fellows  METHODS  In June 2020  a 47-question electronic survey was shared with European Network of Young Gynaecologic Oncologists  ENYGO  members  Specialist fellows in obstetrics and gynecology  and gynecologic oncology  from high- and low-volume centers  who started training between January 1  2017 and January 1  2020 or started before January 1  2017 but finished their training at least 6 months after the LACC trial publication  October 2018   were included  RESULTS  81 of 125  64 8   respondents were included  The median time from the start of the fellowship to completion of the survey was 28 months  range 6-48   56  69 1   respondents were still fellows-in-training  6 of 56  10 7   and 14 of 25  56 0   respondents who were still in training and completed the fellowship  respectively  performed >  10 radical hysterectomies during their training  Fellows trained in an ESGO accredited center had a higher chance to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy  60 4  vs 30 3   p 0 027   There was no difference in the mean number of radical hysterectomies performed by fellows during fellowship before and after the LACC trial publication  8  -12 0 vs 7  -8 4  respectively  p 0 46   A significant reduction in number of minimally invasive radical hysterectomies was noted when comparing the period before and after the LACC trial  38 5  vs 13 8   respectively  p<0 001   CONCLUSION  Exposure to radical surgery for cervical cancer among gynecologic oncology fellows is low  Centralization of cervical cancer cases to high-volume centers may provide an increase in fellows  exposure to radical procedures  The LACC trial publication was associated with a decrease in minimally invasive radical hysterectomies performed by fellows,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992130
3314,OBJECTIVE  Neutralising antibodies are one of the factors to measure individual s immune status for control of infectious diseases  We aimed to confirm the persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  neutralising antibody levels in patients who had recovered from coronavirus disease  COVID-19   METHODS  Plasma donors in South Korea who had completely recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection had follow-up testing to determine the persistence of neutralising antibodies using a plaque-reduction neutralisation test and ELISA  RESULTS  Of the 111 participants  20-29 years  37 111  33 3    30-39 years  17 111  15 3    40-49 years  23 111  20 7    50-59  21 111  18 9    60-65 years  13 111  11 7    male  43 111  38 7    female  68 111  61 3     66 1  still had neutralising antibodies approximately 9 months range 255 to 302 days  after confirmation of the diagnosis  CONCLUSIONS  In this study  we analyzed the titre of neutralising antibodies associated with predicting immune status in individuals with natural infection  Information about the persistence and change in levels of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can be utilised to provide evidence for developing vaccination schedules for individuals with previous infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954127
2208,BACKGROUND  Infections caused by fungi can be important causes of morbidity and mortality in certain patient populations  including those who are highly immunocompromised or critically ill  Invasive mycoses can be caused by well-known species  as well as emerging pathogens  including those that are resistant to clinically available antifungals  CONTENT  This review highlights emerging fungal infections  including newly described species  such as Candida auris  and those that having undergone taxonomic classification and were previously known by other names  including Blastomyces and Emergomyces species  members of the Rasamsonia argillacea species complex  Sporothrix brasiliensis  and Trichophyton indotinae  Antifungal resistance also is highlighted in several of these emerging species  as well as in the well-known opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus  Finally  the increased recognition and importance of fungal co-infections with respiratory pathogens  including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   is discussed  SUMMARY  Both clinicians and clinical microbiology laboratories should remain vigilant regarding emerging fungal infections  These may be difficult both to diagnose and treat due to the lack of experience of clinicians and laboratory personnel with these organisms and the infections they may cause  Many of these fungal infections have been associated with poor clinical outcomes  either due to inappropriate therapy or the development of antifungal resistance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969112
6753,Wearable sensors are emerging as a new technology to detect physiological and biochemical markers for remote health monitoring  By measuring vital signs such as respiratory rate  body temperature  and blood oxygen level  wearable sensors offer tremendous potential for the noninvasive and early diagnosis of numerous diseases such as Covid-19  Over the past decade  significant progress has been made to develop wearable sensors with high sensitivity  accuracy  flexibility  and stretchability  bringing to reality a new paradigm of remote health monitoring  In this review paper  the latest advances in wearable sensor systems that can measure vital signs at an accuracy level matching those of point-of-care tests are presented  In particular  the focus of this review is placed on wearable sensors for measuring respiratory behavior  body temperature  and blood oxygen level  which are identified as the critical signals for diagnosing and monitoring Covid-19  Various designs based on different materials and working mechanisms are summarized  This review is concluded by identifying the remaining challenges and future opportunities for this emerging field,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901382

9155,BACKGROUND  Pain is a clinical feature of COVID-19  however  data about persistent pain after hospital discharge  especially among ICU survivors is scarce  The aim of this study was to explore the incidence and characteristics of new-onset pain and its impact on Health-Related Quality of Life  HRQoL   and to quantify the presence of mood disorders in critically ill COVID-19 survivors  METHODS  This is a preliminary report of PAIN-COVID trial  NCT04394169  presenting a descriptive analysis in critically ill COVID-19 survivors  following in person interview 1 month after hospital discharge  Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory  the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale  HRQoL was evaluated with the EQ 5D 5L  and mood disorders with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  HADS   RESULTS  From 27 May to 19 July 2020  203 patients were consecutively screened for eligibility  and 65 were included in this analysis  Of these  50 8  patients reported new-onset pain  38 5  clinically significant pain  numerical rating score >  3 for average pain intensity   16 9  neuropathic pain  4 6  pain catastrophizing thoughts  44 6  pain in >  2 body sites and 7 7  widespread pain  Patients with new-onset pain had a worse EQ-VAS and EQ index value  p < 0 001   Pain intensity was negatively correlated to both the former  Spearman rho  -0 546  p < 0 001  and the latter  Spearman rho  -0 387  p   0 001   HADS anxiety and depression values equal or above eight were obtained in 10 8  and 7 7  of patients  respectively  CONCLUSION  New-onset pain in critically ill COVID-19 survivors is frequent  and it is associated with a lower HRQoL  Trial registration No   NCT04394169  Registered 19 May 2020  https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04394169  SIGNIFICANCE  A substantial proportion of severe COVID-19 survivors may develop clinically significant persistent pain  post-intensive care syndrome and chronic ICU-related pain  Given the number of infections worldwide and the unprecedented size of the population of critical illness survivors  providing information about the incidence of new-onset pain  its characteristics  and its influence on the patients  quality of life might help establish and improve pain management strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866276
1005,ABSTRACTOlder individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcome but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood  In addition  how age modulates SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infections remains largely unexplored  Here  we investigated age-associated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis  immune responses  and the occurrence of re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infection utilizing a wild type C57BL 6N mouse model  We demonstrated that interferon and adaptive antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge are significantly impaired in aged mice in comparison to young mice  which results in more effective virus replication and severe disease manifestations in the respiratory tract  Aged mice also showed increased susceptibility to re-infection due to insufficient immune protection acquired during primary infection  Importantly  two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination conferred limited adaptive immune response among the aged mice which rendered them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection  Collectively  our findings call for tailored and optimized treatment and prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 among the older individuals,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989330
46,The outbreak of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  has transformed the daily lifestyles of people worldwide  COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic owing to its global spread  and technologies based on engineered materials that help to reduce the spread of infections have been reported  Nanotechnology present in materials with enhanced physicochemical properties and versatile chemical functionalization offer numerous ways to combat the disease  Facemasks are a reliable preventive measure  although they are not 100  effective against viral infections  Nonwoven materials  which are the key components of masks  act as barriers to the virus through filtration  However  there is a high chance of cross-infection because the used mask lacks virucidal properties and can become an additional source of infection  The combination of antiviral and filtration properties enhances the durability and reliability of masks  thereby reducing the likelihood of cross-infection  In this review  we focus on masks  from the manufacturing stage to practical applications  and their abilities to combat COVID-19  Herein  we discuss the impacts of masks on the environment  while considering safe industrial production in the future  Furthermore  we discuss available options for future research directions that do not negatively impact the environment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006814
5718,Vaccines against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  have been highly efficient in protecting against Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19   However  the emergence of viral variants that are more transmissible and  in some cases  escape from neutralizing antibody responses has raised concerns  Here  we evaluated recombinant protein spike antigens derived from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and from variants B 1 1 7  B 1 351  and P 1 for their immunogenicity and protective effect in vivo against challenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in the mouse model  All proteins induced high neutralizing antibodies against the respective viruses but also induced high cross-neutralizing antibody responses  The decline in neutralizing titers between variants was moderate  with B 1 1 7-vaccinated animals having a maximum fold reduction of 4 8 against B 1 351 virus  P 1 induced the most cross-reactive antibody responses but was also the least immunogenic in terms of homologous neutralization titers  However  all antigens protected from challenge with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 in a mouse model,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914685
318,Background  COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and pandemics occur  Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients  their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been fully characterized  Methods  This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients  We recruited 137 participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in four wards of the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan  China  Among the 137 participants  81 patients were recovered  23 patients died  and 33 patients remained hospitalized by the end of the study  SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins were analyzed by chemiluminescence assays  Laboratory and radiological characteristics  and clinical outcomes were compared between the recovered group and the deceased group  Furthermore  a matched cohort study was conducted in which each non-survivor was matched to two recovered patients of similar age  Results  SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in the fourth week after the onset of COVID-19  while serum IgG levels rose earlier and remained high up to the eighth week  In the age-matched cohort study  the serum IgM  but not IgG levels  were higher among the non-survivors than in the recovered group  P   0 006   The area under the ROC curve for the IgM and IgG levels was 0 702  95  CI  0 560-0 845  P   0 006  and 0 596  95  confidence interval  0 449-0 744  P   0 194   respectively  We also showed that patients with COVID-19 who had high IgM or IgG levels  stratified according to best cut-off  exhibited significantly lower overall survival  Kaplan-Meier survival curves  P < 0 05   Discussion  These results indicate the association between immunoglobulins and outcome in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrated that elevated serum IgM levels could indicate poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19  Further  the information about the profile of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgGs may be useful for the future epidemiological investigations of COVID-19 therapies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002299

6310,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19 -related organ failure is partly related to a sepsis-like syndrome and extreme pro-inflammatory cytokine release  named cytokine storm  Therapeutic strategies that prevent the production of or remove the pro-inflammatory cytokines could potentially be an effective therapy in critically afflicted COVID-19 patients  METHODS  In this clinical trial study  from April until June 2020  68 COVID-19 patients  35 vs  33 controls  with severe critical symptoms  and PaO2  FiO2  P F  ratio less than 200 mmHg either received a single standard therapy or a combination of standard treatment for COVID-19 combined with hemoperfusion  hemofilter  HA330 D Javfron  for 4 h  in 3 consecutive days  The length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation  the resolution of radiologic abnormalities  and the mortality rate were defined as the primary outcomes  RESULTS  Demographic characteristics  the acute physiology  and chronic health evaluation score of both groups were similar  p > 0 05   Importantly  we noticed a significant mortality rate reduction in the perfused group compared with controls  37 1  vs  63 6   p   0 02   this positive effect was stronger among those with a P F ratio higher than 75  mortality rate of 84 7  for P F ratio < 75 vs  15 4  for P F ratio >   75  p   0 02   CONCLUSIONS  The results imply that early start of hemoperfusion could be more effective and significantly reduce the mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with critical diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907633
4130,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a viral infection affecting multiple organ systems of great significance for metabolic processes  Thus  there is increasing interest in metabolic and lipoprotein signatures of the disease  and early analyses have demonstrated a metabolic pattern typical for atherosclerotic and hepatic damage in COVID-19 patients  However  it remains unclear whether this is specific for COVID-19 and whether the observed signature is caused by the disease or rather represents an underlying risk factor  To answer this question  we have analyzed 482 serum samples using nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics  including longitudinally collected samples from 12 COVID-19 and 20 cardiogenic shock intensive care patients  samples from 18 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  antibody-positive individuals  and single time point samples from 58 healthy controls  COVID-19 patients showed a distinct metabolic serum profile  including changes typical for severe dyslipidemia and a deeply altered metabolic status compared with healthy controls  Specifically  very-low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoprotein particles and associated apolipoprotein B and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly increased  whereas cholesterol and apolipoprotein A2 were decreased  Moreover  a similarly perturbed profile was apparent when compared with other patients with cardiogenic shock who are in the intensive care unit when looking at a 1-week time course  highlighting close links between COVID-19 and lipid metabolism  The metabolic profile of COVID-19 patients distinguishes those from healthy controls and also from patients with cardiogenic shock  In contrast  anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals without acute COVID-19 did not show a significantly perturbed metabolic profile compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls  but SARS-CoV-2 antibody-titers correlated significantly with metabolic parameters  including levels of glycine  ApoA2  and small-sized low- and high-density lipoprotein subfractions  Our data suggest that COVID-19 is associated with dyslipidemia  which is not observed in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive individuals who have not developed severe courses of the disease  This suggests that lipoprotein profiles may represent a confounding risk factor for COVID-19 with potential for patient stratification,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938772

7315,PURPOSE  To explore individual and community factors associated with adherence to physician recommended urgent eye visits via a tele-triage system during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHOD  We retrospectively reviewed acute visit requests and medical exam data between April 6  2020 and June 6  2020  Patient demographics and adherence to visit were examined  Census tract level community characteristics from the U S  Census Bureau and zip code level COVID-19 related death data from the Cook County Medical Examiner s Office were appended to each geocoded patient address  Descriptive statistics  t-tests  and logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the effects of individual and community variables on adherence to visit  RESULTS  Of 229 patients recommended an urgent visit  216 had matching criteria on chart review  and 192  88 9   adhered to their visit  No difference in adherence was found based on individual characteristics including  age  p    24   gender  p    94   race  p    56   insurance  p    28   nor new versus established patient status  p    20   However  individuals who did not adhere were more likely to reside in neighborhoods with a greater proportion of Blacks  59 4  vs  33 4   p    03   greater unemployment rates  17 5  vs  10 7   p <  01   and greater cumulative deaths from COVID-19  56 vs  31  p    01   Unemployment rate continued to be statistically significant after controlling for race and cumulative deaths from COVID-19  p    04   CONCLUSION  We found that as community unemployment rate increases  adherence to urgent eye visits decreases  after controlling for relevant neighborhood characteristics  Unemployment rates were highest in predominantly Black neighborhoods early in the pandemic  which may have contributed to existing racial disparities in eye care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895007
5354,Data on the tolerability and response to biologic therapies for type 2 immune disorders in the context of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  are currently lacking  Our survey aimed at assessing the adherence of patients to dupilumab therapy and the risk of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  A total of 80 patients with atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab completed a web-based survey  Of the 80 patients  7 discontinued dupilumab owing to concerns and difficulties related to COVID-19  Our sample was highly susceptible to viral infection owing to the frequency of risk factors including living in high SARS-CoV-2 burden areas  such as in Northern Italy  having comorbidities  such as asthma  diabetes  and cardiovascular disease  and being of advanced age  Older patients in our sample are particularly exposed to the risk of COVID-19-related cytokine storm  triggered by excessive interleukin-4 production and type 2 immune response  One patient contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection without the progression of COVID-19 despite continuing scheduled dupilumab treatment  Because evidence on the appropriate management of biologic therapy in the setting of COVID-19 is lacking  the collection of clinical data from patients in treatment with dupilumab is a valuable addition to current clinical practice  Our survey provides a contribution to the understanding of the tolerability and response to dupilumab during COVID-19 and suggests a feasible and effective approach to patients being treated with biologics even when social distancing is required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920828
6808,Background  The present COVID-19 pandemic has tended toward normality  To provide convenient  safe  and effective home treatment programs for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer  ROC   the clinical efficacy and safety of poly  ADP-ribose  polymerase inhibitor  PARPi   including olaparib  niraparib  and rucaparib  monotherapy as a maintenance treatment for platinum-sensitive ROC were systematically evaluated  Methods  Numerous electronic databases were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials  RCTs  of PARPi maintenance treatment for ROC that were published before June 2021  The primary endpoints were overall survival  OS  and progression-free survival  PFS   and the secondary endpoint was grade 3-4 adverse effects  AEs   After data extraction and the quality evaluation of the included studies  Bayesian network meta-analysis  NMA  was performed using R software  The ability of each treatment was ranked using the surface under the cumulative ranking  SUCRA  curve  Results  The analysis included five studies and 1390 patients  The NMA results demonstrated that compared with the placebo  olaparib and niraparib exhibited significant benefits in the gBRCA-mutated population  and respectively reduced the risk of death by 31   HR   0 69  95  CI  0 53-0 90  and 34   HR   0 66  95  CI  0 44-0 99   Olaparib  niraparib  and rucaparib were all found to be very effective in prolonging PFS in patients with ROC  All three PARPi treatments increased the number of grade 3-4 AEs in patients with ROC as compared with the placebo  Conclusions  Overall  olaparib and niraparib maintenance treatment can significantly prolong the OS of patients with gBRCA mutations  Furthermore  the three investigated PARPi monotherapy maintenance treatments can prolong PFS regardless of BRCA mutation status  Although the incidence of AEs in the treatment groups was found to be significantly higher than that in the placebo group  the patients in the treatment group tolerated the treatment  Home oral PARPi treatment can balance tumor treatment and pandemic prevention and control  and is the most convenient  safe  and effective home treatment method available against the background of the current COVID-19 pandemic  Systematic Review Registration  https   inplasy com inplasy-2021-6-0033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900739
6532,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   This virus has become a global pandemic with unprecedented mortality and morbidity along with attendant financial and economic crises  Furthermore  COVID-19 can easily be transmitted regardless of religion  race  sex  or status  Globally  high hospitalization rates of COVID-19 patients have been reported  and billions of dollars have been spent to contain the pandemic  Angiotensin-converting enzyme  ACE  2 is a receptor of SARS-CoV-2  which has a significant role in the entry of the virus into the host cell  ACE2 is highly expressed in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs  upper esophagus  stratified epithelial cells  and other tissues in the body  The diminished expressions of ACE2 have been associated with hypertension  arteriosclerosis  heart failure  chronic kidney disease  and immune system dysregulation  Overall  the potential drug candidates that could serve as ACE2 activators or enhance the expression of ACE2 in a disease state  such as COVID-19  hold considerable promise in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic  This study reviews the therapeutic potential and pharmacological benefits of the novel ACE2 in the management of COVID-19 using search engines  such as Google  Scopus  PubMed  and PubMed Central,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903929
6846,Background  To avoid the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 in early 2020  many countries have implemented strict lockdown measures for several weeks  In Austria  the lockdown in early spring has led to a significant drop in human outdoor activities  especially in road traffic  In Project Roadkill  a citizen science project which aims to collect data on road-killed animals  we observed a significant decrease in reported roadkills  Methods  By asking the citizen scientists through a survey how their travelling routines were affected  we investigated if the observed decrease in roadkills was grounded in less animals being killed by traffic  or in citizen scientists staying at home and thus reporting less road-killed animals  Results  A majority of the respondents stated that they felt to have reported less roadkills during the lockdown  regardless if they changed their travelling routine or not  This observation in combination with the overall decrease in road traffic indicates that fewer animals were killed during the lockdown  We conclude that when analyzing citizen science data  the effects of lockdown measures on reporting behaviour should be considered  because they can significantly affect data and interpretation of these data,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900421
2296,PURPOSE  Postpartum experiences have been adversely affected by the burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic  However  there are no well-tested measures of pandemic-specific postpartum stress  We developed a modified  postpartum version of the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale  PREPS  and examined the psychometric properties of this novel measure  METHODS  Online questionnaires were administered at 3-4 month intervals throughout pregnancy and postpartum to women pregnant at the start of the pandemic  This study reports psychometric properties of the Pandemic-Related Postpartum Stress Scale  PREPS-PP  among women who were administered this instrument at either of two postpartum timepoints  RESULTS  At both timepoints  n   1301 and n   1009   CFAs revealed good model fit of the same three-factor structure identified for the prenatal PREPS  Preparedness Stress  Infection Stress  and Positive Appraisal   All PREPS-PP subscales demonstrated good reliability  alpha s  78-87   Higher levels of Preparedness Stress and Infection Stress were associated with greater health and financial burdens and psychological distress  CONCLUSIONS  The PREPS-PP is a reliable and valid measure of postpartum stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic  It is a valuable tool for future research into how pandemic-related postpartum stress may affect families in the short- and long-term,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967691
6834,The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are two global crises that require collective action  Yet  the inertia typically associated with behavior change to limit climate change stands in contrast to the speed associated with behavior change to stop the spread of COVID-19  Identifying the roots of these differences can help us stimulate climate-friendly behaviors  We assessed the extent to which a number of theory-based drivers underlie behaviors aiming to counter COVID-19 and climate change with an online survey  N   534   We focused on the role of a number of drivers derived from prominent behavior change theories and meta-analyses in the field  namely  personal threat  threat to close others  threat to vulnerable others  fear  participative efficacy  injunctive and descriptive social norms  and governmental policy perceptions  We investigated  1  what drivers people perceived as most important to engage in behaviors that limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change and  2  the strength of the associations between these drivers and engaging in behaviors that limit the spread of the pandemic and climate change  Results highlight three key drivers for climate change action  changing perceptions of governmental policy and perceptions of threat to close others and priming participative efficacy beliefs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900513

9434,OBJECTIVE  The Spanish health system is made up of seventeen regional health systems  Through the official reporting systems  some inconsistencies and differences in case fatality rates between Autonomous Communities  CC AA   have been observed  Therefore the objective of this paper is to compare COVID-19 case fatality rates across the Spanish CC AA  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Observational descriptive study  The COVID-19 case fatality rate  CFR  was estimated according to the official records  CFR-PCR    the daily mortality monitory system  MoMo  record  CFR-Mo   and the seroprevalence study ENE-COVID-19  Estudio Nacional de sero Epidemiologia Covid-19  according to sex  age group and CC AA  between March and June 2020  The main objective is to detect whether there are any differences in CFR between Spanish Regions using two different register systems  i  e   the official register of the Ministry of Health and the MoMo  RESULTS  Overall  the CFR-Mo was higher than the CFR-PCR   1 59  vs 0 98   The differences in case fatality rate between both methods were significantly higher in Castilla La Mancha  Castilla y Leon  Cataluna  and Madrid  The difference between both methods was higher in persons over 74 years of age  CFR-PCR  7 5  vs 13 0  for the CFR-Mo  but without statistical significance  There was no correlation of the estimated prevalence of infection with CFR-PCR   but there was with CFR-Mo  R2   0 33   Andalucia presented a SCFR below 1 with both methods  and Asturias had a SCFR higher than 1  Cataluna and Castilla La Mancha presented a SCFR greater than 1 in any scenario of SARS-CoV-2 infection calculated with SCFR-Mo  CONCLUSIONS  The PCR  case fatality rate underestimates the case fatality rate of the SARS-CoV- 2 virus pandemic  It is therefore preferable to consider the MoMo case fatality rate  Significant differences have been observed in the information and registration systems and in the severity of the pandemic between the Spanish CC AA  Although the infection prevalence correlates with case fatality rate  other factors such as age  comorbidities  and the policies adopted to address the pandemic can explain the differences observed between CC AA,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860848
8452,BACKGROUND  Various studies indicated blunted humoral responses to COVID-19 mRNA and viral vector vaccines among people with multiple sclerosis  pwMS  on sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor  S1PR  modulators and anti-CD20 therapies  aCD20   however  limited evidence was found regarding SARS-CoV-2 serology after inactivated virus vaccination  OBJECTIVE  To provide evidence regarding humoral response to COVID-19 inactivated virus vaccination among pwMS on disease-modifying therapies  DMTs   METHODS  A cohort study was carried out in Isfahan  Iran  enrolling DMT-exposed pwMS and unexposed  UX  healthy participants  Post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG serology testing was carried out among the participants and compared between participants based on their DMT exposure  using proper statistical tests  A multivariable logistic regression model was used to control for confounding  Association between the second vaccine dose-to-phlebotomy  vac2phleb  and the humoral response was investigated in each DMT-exposed cohort  using linear regression  Among the aCD20 cohort  the association of the last aCD20 infusion-to-first vaccine dose period with serostatus was investigated using an unpaired t-test  RESULTS  After enrolling 358 participants  144 pwMS and 214 healthy   blunted humoral responses were only observed in fingolimod  Log10 mean diff   SE   0 72  0 18   P   0 001  and aCD20  Log10 mean diff   SE   0 75  0 15   P < 0 001  cohorts compared to the UX cohort  Multivariable analysis confirmed the results  The study did not achieve enough statistical power to detect a significant association between the vac2phleb period and humoral responses  The last aCD20 infusion to first vaccination dose period was longer in the seroconverted pwMS on aCD20  mean diff   SE   8 43 weeks  2 57   P   0 005   CONCLUSION  The results of this study mirrored the results of previous studies among mRNA- or viral vector-vaccinated pwMS on DMTs  Therefore  it can be concluded that mode of action contributes less than timing  to the efficiency of vaccination strategies among pwMS on DMTs - especially the ones on S1PR modulators and aCD20  Meanwhile  the mentioned pwMS should be advised to receive early boosters and remain vigilant until further data becomes available and more efficient vaccination strategies are crafted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875487
2598,A steady and consistent national and local government leadership is crucial in times of crisis  The trust in government - which can be so fragile - was strong in Eldoret town  a large municipal in western Kenya widely known for ethnic conflicts  In our interviews with 20 business people and 30 community members from Eldoret town  we found that the trust built early in the pandemic was broken due to individual leaders who eventually dismissed public health promotion and engaged in politics and corruption of funds for COVID-19 relief  When leadership was strong  locals in Eldoret town  and especially business owners  engaged in public health prevention measures for the greater good  But when leadership slipped  people complained and eventually ignored public health prevention measures at home  on the bus  and in businesses around town  causing the intensification of outbreaks  This was most common among those engaged in the formal economy as those in the informal economy were more likely to mistrust the government altogether  We show who falls through the cracks when government policy targets viral threats and suggest how local government and public health agencies might work to control COVID-19 infections while ensuring that all Eldoret residents are cared for,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962853
4374,In the spring of 2020  the COVID-19 pandemic changed the daily lives of people around the world  In an effort to quantify these changes  Google released an open-source dataset pertaining to regional mobility trends-including park visitation trends  Changes in park visitation are calculated from an earlier baseline period for measurement  Park visitation is robustly linked to positive wellbeing indicators across the lifespan  and has been shown to support wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic  Therefore  this dataset offers vast application potential  containing aggregated information from location data collected via smartphones worldwide  However  empirical analysis of these data is limited  Namely  the factors influencing reported changes in mobility and the degree to which these changes can be directly attributable to COVID-19 remain unknown  This study aims to address these gaps in our understanding of the changes in park visitation  the causes of these changes  e g   safer-at-home orders  amount of COVID-19 cases per county  climate  etc   and possible impacts to wellbeing by constructing and testing a spatial regression model  Results suggest that elevation and latitude serve as primary influences of reported changes in park visitation from the baseline period  Therefore  it is surmised that Google s reported changes in park-related mobility are only partially the function of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934999
5491,Pulmonary hamartomas represent the most frequent family of benign lung tumors that typically involve the lung parenchyma and only rarely grow as endobronchial tumors  The elective treatment of endobronchial hamartoma is the bronchoscopic resection  and in those cases in which tumor extension and localization makes it not possible  surgical treatment must be evaluated  Patients with symptomatic COVID-19  hospitalized  frequently undergo a chest CT scan and in some cases  occasional findings may emerge  requiring diagnostic investigations such as bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology procedures  Therefore  in such a delicate pathological condition  such as COVID-19  the need to perform bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology procedures  minimizing the risk of viral transmission and ensuring necessary assistance  represents a great challenge for pulmonologists  In this article authors describe  for the first time in literature  a rare case of endobronchial hamartoma  radically resected using a single use bronchoscope  in a young female patient hospitalized for symptomatic COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918499

5271,OBJECTIVES  Antiphospholipid antibodies  APAs  increase the risk of excessive blood clotting  but their role in COVID-19 remains unclear  We aimed to investigate the presence of conventional APAs used in the classification of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in patients with severe lung infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to compare these results with non-COVID-19 critically ill patients  METHODS  Thirty-one COVID-19 patients  COVID group  and 28 non-COVID-19 critically ill patients  non-COVID group   were included in the study  Anti-cardiolipin  ACA   IgG  IgM   anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1  Anti-beta2GPI   IgG  IgM  and IgA   and if the patient had not received any anti thrombotic agent before blood collection  lupus anticoagulant  LAC  tests were studied from the plasma of the patients  For testing ACA and Anti-beta2GPI  ELISA method was used  while fully automated coagulometer device was used for LAC test  RESULTS  APAs were positive in 25 81  in the COVID group  8 31  and 25  in the non-COVID group  7 28   LAC was the most common APA present in 23 08  of the COVID-19 group  who underwent measurement  6 26   while 3 57  of the non-COVID group was LAC positive  1 28   p    047   In the COVID group  ACA IgM  and IgG were positive in 6 45  and 0   respectively  2 31 vs 0 31   In the non-COVID group  ACA IgM was not positive in any patient  while ACA IgG was positive in 7 14   2 28   Anti-beta2GPI IgG and IgM tests were not positive in any patient in either the COVID or the non-COVID group  Anti-beta2GPI IgA were positive in 6 45  and 14 29   respectively  2 31 vs 4 28   CONCLUSION  In this study  APAs were equally positive in critically ill patients among COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients  Only LAC was more observed in COVID-19 patients  KEY MESSAGES,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922398
4302,Over the years  a novel RNA coronavirus has emerged with mutational episodes  This virus was confirmed to cause severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and coronavirus infectious disease-2019  COVID-19   This particular emphasis has raised the risk signal at the global level  Hepatic injury has been known to be a major impairment with varying factors  In recent years  the mechanistic event of hepatic injury is now more controversial and has a lack of justifiable set  Nevertheless  it has been investigated for the prominence of inflammatory signals  viral load in hepatocytes  followed by an intensive care therapeutic defense  and or drug toxicity  Limited reports are available on infection-mediated hepatic injury  and its associated mechanism is still poorly understood  In the context of COVID-19 infections  the initial episode is pulmonary disorder with a systemic infection in multiple organs  including the liver  The majority of the reported cases reveal hepatic damage or dysfunction among COVID-19-infected patients  Prevalence of altered biochemistry of liver enzymes was also observed in the COVID-19 infected population  Our review focuses on the probable mechanisms and therapeutic options of COVID-19 and its associated hepatic dysfunction  We also discuss the available prescribed medications against COVID-19 infections  such as remdesiver  oseltamivir  lopina-vir ritonavir  ribavirin  anticoagulant  anti-inflammatory  and immune-based therapies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936298
7792,BACKGROUND  Peripheral hematological changes in severe COVID-19 patients may reflect the immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection  Characteristics of peripheral white blood cells as early signals were needed to be investigated for clarifying its associations with the fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients  METHODS  A retrospective cohort study was performed and the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were recruited in wards of Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan  Hubei province  China  Characteristics of peripheral white blood cells in survivors and non-survivors were analyzed  Comparison among patients with different level of eosinophils was performed  RESULTS  Of 198 patients included in this study  185 were discharged and 13 died  Levels of eosinophils  lymphocytes and basophils in non-survivors were significantly lower than those in survivors  Death rate in low eosinophils group was higher and no patient died in normal eosinophils group  16 7  vs 0  P < 0 001   The proportion of patients in low eosinophils group who used glucocorticoids was higher than in normal eosinophils group  but glucocorticoids usage was not an indicator for death in subgroup analysis in low eosinophils patients  Moreover  positive correlation was found between the counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils in patients with glucocorticoids use but not in patients without the treatment  CONCLUSIONS  Hematological changes differed between survivors and non-survivors with COVID-19  Lymphopenia and eosinopenia could be predictors for poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients  Initial counts of eosinophils may guide us in usage of glucocorticoids for COVID-19 treatment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886793
4803,Since December 2019  the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in countless deaths and has harmed all facets of human existence  COVID-19 has been designated an epidemic by the World Health Organization  WHO   which has placed a tremendous burden on nearly all countries  especially those with weak health systems  However  Deep Learning  DL  has been applied in several applications and many types of detection applications in the medical field  including thyroid diagnosis  lung nodule recognition  fetal localization  and detection of diabetic retinopathy  Furthermore  various clinical imaging sources  like Magnetic Resonance Imaging  MRI   X-ray  and Computed Tomography  CT   make DL a perfect technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19  Inspired by this fact  a considerable amount of research has been done  A Systematic Literature Review  SLR  has been used in this study to discover  assess  and integrate findings from relevant studies  DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks  LSTM   Self-Organizing Maps  SOMs   Conventional Neural Networks  CNNs   Generative Adversarial Networks  GANs   Recurrent Neural Networks  RNNs   Autoencoders  and hybrid approaches  Then  the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted  Moreover  many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for COVID-19 have been addressed  which are anticipated to stimulate more investigations to control the prevalence and disaster control in the future  According to the findings  most papers are assessed using characteristics such as accuracy  delay  robustness  and scalability  Meanwhile  other features are underutilized  such as security and convergence time  Python is also the most commonly used language in papers  accounting for 75  of the time  According to the investigation  37 83  of applications have identified chest CT chest X-ray images for patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929464

3132,There has been considerable speculation regarding how people cope during the COVID-19 pandemic  however  surveys requiring selection from prespecified answers are limited by researcher views and may overlook the most effective measures  Here  we apply an unbiased approach that learns from people s collective lived experiences through the application of natural-language processing of their free-text reports  At the peak of the first lockdown in the United Kingdom  51 113 individuals provided free-text responses regarding self-perceived positive and negative impact of the pandemic  as well as the practical measures they had found helpful during this period  Latent Dirichlet Allocation identified  in an unconstrained data-driven manner  the most common impact and advice topics  We report that six negative topics and seven positive topics are optimal for capturing the different ways people reported being affected by the pandemic  Forty-five topics were required to optimally summarize the practical coping strategies that they recommended  General linear modelling showed that the prevalence of these topics covaried substantially with age  We propose that a wealth of coping measures may be distilled from the lived experiences of the general population  These may inform feasible individually tailored digital interventions that have relevance during and beyond the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956602
9394,OBJECTIVES  Telemedicine was increasingly adopted in otolaryngology as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  but how it compares to in-person visits over the longitudinal course of the pandemic has not been characterized  This study compares telemedicine visits to in-person visits on measures of clinical efficiency and patient satisfaction  METHODS  We examined all in-person and telemedicine encounters that occurred during the 13-month period from April 1  2020 to April 30  2021 at a pediatric otolaryngology clinic associated with a large tertiary care children s hospital  We compared patient demographics  primary encounter diagnoses  completions  cancellations  no-shows  cycle time  and patient satisfaction  RESULTS  A total of 19 541  90 5   in-person visits and 2051  9 5   telemedicine visits were scheduled over the study period  There was no difference in patient age or gender between the visit types  There was a difference in race  75  White or Caucasian for in-person and 73  for telemedicine  P    007  and average travel distance  53 3 miles for in-person vs 71 0 for telemedicine  P    000   The most common primary diagnosis was Eustachian tube dysfunction for in-person visits  11 8   and sleep disordered breathing for telemedicine visits  13 7    Completion rate was greater for telemedicine visits  52 4  in-person vs 62 5  telemedicine   Cancellations were greater for in-person visits  42 6  in-person vs 24 2  telemedicine   but no-shows were greater for telemedicine  5 0  in-person vs 13 3  telemedicine  all P    000   Average cycle time was shorter for telemedicine visits  56 5 minutes in-person vs 47 6 minutes telemedicine  P    000   Patient satisfaction with provider interactions and overall care experience was high for both visit types  CONCLUSIONS  Telemedicine was utilized more during months of heightened COVID-19 cases  with higher completion rates  fewer cancellations  shorter cycle times  saved travel distance  and comparable patient satisfaction to in-person visits  Telemedicine has the potential to remain an efficient mode of care delivery in the post-pandemic era,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861781
9173,Biodistribution studies of adenovirus-based vaccines support their clinical development by evaluating their spread and persistence following in vivo administration  AZD1222  ChAdox1 nCov-19  is a replication-deficient non-human adenovirus-vectored vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019  In this nonclinical study  the biodistribution of AZD1222 was assessed in mice for 29 days following intramuscular injection  Results show that AZD1222 was safe and well tolerated  with a spread that was largely confined to administration sites and the proximal sciatic nerve  with low levels observed in sites that are involved in rapid clearance of particulates by the reticuloendothelial system  Accordingly  levels of AZD1222 decreased from Day 2 to Day 29  indicating clearance  There were no quantifiable levels of AZD1222 in the blood  brain  spinal cord  and reproductive tissue  suggesting a lack of widespread or long-term distribution of AZD1222 vector DNA throughout the body following its administration,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865878
6749,As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic grew in 2020  uncertainty surrounding its origins and nature led to widespread conspiracy-related theories  CRT   Use of technological platforms enabled the rapid and exponential dissemination of COVID-19 CRT  This study applies social contagion theory to examine how Google Autocomplete  GA  propagates and perpetuates these CRT  An in-house software program  Autocomplete Search Logging Tool  ASLT  captured a snapshot of GA COVID-19 related searches early in the pandemic  from March to May 2020  across 76 randomly-selected countries to gain insight into search behaviors around the world  Analysis identified 15 keywords relating to COVID-19 CRT predictions and demonstrate how searches across different countries received varying degrees of GA predictions  When grouped with similar keywords  two major categories were identified  Man-Made Biological Weapon   42   n   2 111   and  Questioning Reality Severity of COVID-19   44   n   2 224   This investigation is also among the first to apply social contagion theory to autocomplete applications and can be used in future research to explain and perhaps mitigate the spread of CRT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901396
2825,The pandemic state has a destructive effect on the human psyche and induces fear for one s own health  By reducing the risk of severe COVID-19  vaccination may indirectly improve the mental state  This study aims to assess the effects of vaccination on respondents  mental well-being  their attitudes towards adherence to government recommendations limiting viral transmission  and to identify factors that may influence the decision to get vaccinated  The survey took the form of the authors  own  fully voluntary  anonymous  online questionnaire  Standardised psychometric tools were used in the survey  Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment  GAD-7  and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life  MANSA   The survey involved 1696 respondents  the vast majority of whom were women  and were aged 18-29  The vaccination status was declared by 1677 respondents  98 9    430  25 4   of whom were vaccinated with at least one dose of vaccine  while 303  17 9   respondents were not only unvaccinated at all  and declared no intention to get vaccinated in the future  Fully vaccinated individuals were found to have lower levels of anxiety  higher MANSA scores and lower subjective anxiety about being infected with COVID-19 than those awaiting vaccination or those with an incomplete vaccination regimen  one dose   Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have the lowest sense of anxiety and fear of being infected and they have the lowest adherence to government recommendations limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission  Conclusions  COVID-19 vaccination reduces the level of anxiety about being infected and anxiety due to COVID-19 disease in people from the immediate environment  Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have extreme attitudes that negate the pandemic as a whole  including the need for COVID-19 vaccination  Fully vaccinated individuals still adhere to the SARS-CoV-2 prevention policies in place,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960190
1199,Parents of children with genetically determined leukoencephalopathies play a major role in their children s health care  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic  many health care services were suspended  delayed or delivered remotely with telemedicine  We sought to explore the experience of parents of children with genetically determined leukoencephalopathies during the pandemic given the adapted health care services  We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 parents of 13 affected children  Three main themes were identified using thematic analysis  perceived impact of COVID-19 on health care services  benefits and challenges of telemedicine  and expectations of health care after the pandemic  Parents perceived a loss delay in health care services while having a positive response to telemedicine  Parents wished telemedicine would remain in their care after the pandemic  This is the first study assessing the impact of COVID-19 on health care services in this population  Our results suggest that parents experience a higher level of stress owing to the shortage of services and the children s vulnerability,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986037
7434,One deadly aspect of COVID-19 is that those infected can often be contagious before exhibiting overt symptoms  While methods such as temperature checks and sinus swabs have aided with early detection  the former does not always provide a reliable indicator of COVID-19  and the latter is invasive and requires significant human and material resources to administer  This paper presents a non-invasive COVID-19 early screening system implementable with commercial off-the-shelf wireless communications devices  The system leverages the Doppler radar principle to monitor respiratory-related chest motion and identifies breathing rates that indicate COVID-19 infection  A prototype was developed from software-defined radios  SDRs  designed for 5G NR wireless communications and system performance was evaluated using a robotic mover simulating human breathing  and using actual breathing  resulting in a consistent respiratory rate accuracy better than one breath per minute  exceeding that used in common medical practice Clinical Relevance-This establishes the potential efficacy of wireless communications based radar for recognizing respiratory disorders such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892845
9356,BACKGROUND  The severity of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unpredictable  Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  ACE2  is the receptor responsible for coronavirus binding  while subsequent cell entry relies on priming by the serine protease TMPRSS2  transmembrane protease  serine 2   Although renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system  RAAS  blockers have been suggested to upregulate ACE2  their use in COVID-19 patients is now considered well tolerated  The aim of our study was to investigate parameters that determine COVID-19 severity  focusing on RAAS-components and variation in the genes encoding for ACE2 and TMPRSS2  METHODS  Adult patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection between May 2020 and October 2020 in the Haga Teaching Hospital were included  and soluble ACE2  sACE2   renin  aldosterone  in heparin plasma  and polymorphisms in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes  in DNA obtained from EDTA blood  were determined  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS  Out of the 188 patients who were included  60 were defined as severe COVID-19  ICU and or death   These patients more often used antidiabetic drugs  were older  had higher renin and sACE2 levels  lower aldosterone levels and a lower aldosterone renin ratio  In addition  they displayed the TMPRSS2-rs2070788 AA genotype less frequently  No ACE2 polymorphism-related differences were observed  Multivariate regression analysis revealed independent significance for age  sACE2  the aldosterone renin ratio  and the TMPRSS2 rs2070788 non-AA genotype as predictors of COVID-19 severity  together yielding a C-index of 0 79  Findings were independent of the use of RAAS blockers  CONCLUSION  High sACE2  a low aldosterone renin ratio and having the TMPRSS2 rs2070788 non-AA genotype are novel independent determinants that may help to predict COVID-19 disease severity  TRIAL REGISTRATION  retrospectively registered,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862332
3399,BACKGROUND  Restrictions on face-to-face contact  due to COVID-19  led to a rapid adoption of technology to remotely deliver cardiac rehabilitation  CR   Some technologies  including Active   me  were used without knowing their benefits  We assessed changes in patient activation measure  PAM  in patients participating in routine CR  using Active   me  We also investigated changes in PAM among low  moderate  and high risk patients  changes in cardiovascular risk factors  and explored patient and healthcare professional experiences of using Active   me  METHODS  Patients received standard CR education and an exercise prescription  Active   me was used to monitor patient health  progress towards goals  and provide additional lifestyle support  Patients accessed Active   me through a smart-device application which synchronised to telemetry enabled scales  blood pressure monitors  pulse oximeter  and activity trackers  Changes in PAM score following CR were calculated  Sub-group analysis was conducted on patients at high  moderate  and low risk of exercise induced cardiovascular events  Qualitative interviews explored the acceptability of Active   me  RESULTS  Forty-six patients were recruited  Age  60 4   - 10 9 years  BMI  27 9   - 5 0 kg   m 2   78 3  male   PAM scores increased from 65 5  range  51 0 to 100 0  to 70 2  range  40 7 to 100 0  P   0 039   PAM scores of high risk patients increased from 61 9  range  53 0 to 91 0  to 75 0  range  58 1 to 100 0  P   0 044   The PAM scores of moderate and low risk patients did not change  Resting systolic blood pressure decreased from 125 mmHg  95  CI  120 to 130 mmHg  to 119 mmHg  95  CI  115 to 122 mmHg  P   0 023  and waist circumference measurements decreased from 92 8 cm  95  CI  82 6 to 102 9 cm  to 85 3 cm  95  CI 79 1 to 96 2 cm  P   0 026   Self-reported physical activity levels increased from 1557 5 MET-minutes  range  245 0 to 5355 0 MET-minutes  to 3363 2 MET-minutes  range  105 0 to 12 360 0 MET-minutes  P < 0 001   Active   me was acceptable to patients and healthcare professionals  CONCLUSION  Participation in standard CR  with Active   me  is associated with increased patient skill  knowledge  and confidence to manage their condition  Active   me may be an appropriate platform to support CR delivery when patients cannot be seen face-to-face  TRIAL REGISTRATION  As this was not a clinical trial  the study was not registered in a trial registry,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34952575

711,In the era of open data  Poisson and other count regression models are increasingly important  Still  conventional Poisson regression has remaining issues in terms of identifiability and computational efficiency  Especially  due to an identification problem  Poisson regression can be unstable for small samples with many zeros  Provided this  we develop a closed-form inference for an over-dispersed Poisson regression including Poisson additive mixed models  The approach is derived via mode-based log-Gaussian approximation  The resulting method is fast  practical  and free from the identification problem  Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the estimation error of the proposed method is a considerably smaller estimation error than the closed-form alternatives and as small as the usual Poisson regressions  For counts with many zeros  our approximation has better estimation accuracy than conventional Poisson regression  We obtained similar results in the case of Poisson additive mixed modeling considering spatial or group effects  The developed method was applied for analyzing COVID-19 data in Japan  This result suggests that influences of pedestrian density  age  and other factors on the number of cases change over periods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995283

8239,While underscoring the need for timely  nationally representative data in ambulatory  hospital  and long-term-care settings  the COVID-19 pandemic posed many challenges to traditional methods and mechanisms of data collection  To continue generating data from health care and long-term-care providers and establishments in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic  the National Center for Health Statistics had to modify survey operations for several of its provider-based National Health Care Surveys  including quickly adding survey questions that captured the experiences of providing care during the pandemic  With the aim of providing information that may be useful to other health care data collection systems  this article presents some key challenges that affected data collection activities for these national provider surveys  as well as the measures taken to minimize the disruption in data collection and to optimize the likelihood of disseminating quality data in a timely manner   Am J Public Health  2021 111 12  2141-2148  https   doi org 10 2105 AJPH 2021 306514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878878
5963,Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic caused an increase in the demand for personal protective equipment  PPE  and disruptions in production chains  resulting in an acute shortage of PPE  A possible solution to this problem was additive manufacturing  AM  technology - allowing for a quick start of the production of PPE and potentially able to meet the demand until the production is restored  In addition  AM allows for the production of PPE prototypes with potentially greater comfort of use or degree of protection  In order to assess the production of PPE in AM during the COVID-19 pandemic  previously published articles in this field were analyzed  After analyzing abstracts and full texts  30 original works were selected from the initially collected 487 articles  Based on the analyzed literature  it was found that there are not enough studies comparing traditional and AM PPE as well as not enough comparisons of the different types of AM PPE with each other  In many cases  researchers focused only on the subjective assessment of the comfort of using PPE  without assessing their effectiveness in preventing infections  Despite that  AM has a great potential to quickly produce lacking PPE  Respirators and shields made by AM were rated by the vast majority of users as comfortable to wear  Some of the respirators could be adapted to a specific user  by designing on the basis of a face scan or after warming up the finished print and modeling the shape,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910387

4955,Background  SARS CoV2 continues to pose a threat to human race even after one year of its outset in China  Observational studies from across the world have shown huge disparity in the clinicoepidemiological and laboratory features of this disease  In this study we attempt to assess the clinical  epidemiological and laboratory parameters of COVID 19 positive patients in this geographic location  Methods  This is a descriptive retrospective study of patients who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at a tertiary care centre in central Kerala  India between July 16  2020 and November 30  2020  The clinicoepidemiological and laboratory parameters of the confirmed patients were collected from the laboratory and hospital records and analysed  Results  A total of 1051 patients were tested positive during the study period  The mean age of the patients was 45 7 years   - Standard Deviation  SD   8 68  51 76  were male  Among them 658  62 61   were symptomatic and 393 37 39   were asymptomatic  males  54 7   were more symptomatic than females  45 3    The common presenting symptoms were fever  43 58    cough  21 50    myalgia or fatigue  10 28    Lymphocytopenia was more in males than females  Laboratory parameters such as Serum Ferritin  Alanine Transferase  Aspartate Transferase  Sodium level were elevated in males compared to female  Conclusion  The common symptoms in our study could emphasize on identifying potential patients in this geographic area  Asymptomatic patients should be monitored and investigated for effective control of the disease  A knowledge about the disease presentation in each geographic area is important in planning the effective management strategies since the features are varied from place to place,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926868
2758,The SARS-CoV-2 virus s ability to induce hypercytokinemia and cause multiple organ failure makes it imperative to find effective treatments  To understand the mechanism of viral infection and its effects on organ tissues  we analyzed multiple single-cell and bulk RNAseq data from COVID-19 patients  organ samples  Various levels of severity of infection were accounted for  with comparative analyses between mild  moderate  and severely infected patients  Our analysis uncovered an upregulation of the innate immune response via several inflammatory genes  IL-2  IL-6  IL-8  IL-17A  and NF-kappaB  Consequently  we found that the upregulation of these downstream effects can lead to organ injury  The downregulated pathways such as eukaryotic initiation factor 2  eIF2  and eIF4-mediated host translation  were found to lead to an increased viral translation  We also found that the loss of inhibitory peptides can suppress an overactive innate immune response via NF-kappaB and interleukin-mediated pathways  Investigation of viral-host protein mapping showed that the interaction of viral proteins with host proteins correlated with the down- and upregulation of host pathways such as decreased eIF2-mediated host translation and increased hypertrophy and fibrosis  Inflammation was increased via the stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppression of host translation pathways that led to reduced inflammatory inhibitors  Cardiac hypertrophy and organ fibrosis were the results of increased inflammation in organs of severe and critical patients  Finally  we identified potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19 and its deleterious effects on organs  Further experimental investigation would conclusively determine the effects of COVID-19 infection on organs other than the lungs and the effectiveness of the proposed therapeutic targets,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960687

4448,The world is currently experiencing an ongoing pandemic of an infectious disease named coronavirus disease 2019  i e   COVID-19   which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Computed Tomography  CT  plays an important role in assessing the severity of the infection and can also be used to identify those symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers  With a surge of the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients  radiologists are increasingly stressed to examine the CT scans manually  Therefore  an automated 3D CT scan recognition tool is highly in demand since the manual analysis is time-consuming for radiologists and their fatigue can cause possible misjudgment  However  due to various technical specifications of CT scanners located in different hospitals  the appearance of CT images can be significantly different leading to the failure of many automated image recognition approaches  The multi-domain shift problem for the multi-center and multi-scanner studies is therefore nontrivial that is also crucial for a dependable recognition and critical for reproducible and objective diagnosis and prognosis  In this paper  we proposed a COVID-19 CT scan recognition model namely coronavirus information fusion and diagnosis network  CIFD-Net  that can efficiently handle the multi-domain shift problem via a new robust weakly supervised learning paradigm  Our model can resolve the problem of different appearance in CT scan images reliably and efficiently while attaining higher accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934410

1850,The Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic is affecting many areas of life and has led to major changes in undergraduate medical education  Even before the COVID-19 pandemic  high mental burden of medical students has frequently been reported in the literature  Additional pandemic-specific stressors could exacerbate this situation  This study aimed to assess mental health outcomes among medical students during the first semester after the COVID-19 outbreak and perception of the students on how the learning environment has changed  In May 2020  we conducted a cross-sectional survey among undergraduate medical students at a large medical school in Germany  The survey included validated mental health instruments  Distress Thermometer  Patient Health Questionnaire 4  and self-developed items to examine the perception of the study situation during the COVID-19 pandemic  Open-ended questions were analyzed by conventional content analyses  The response rate was 59 2   914 1 545   Overall  61 9  of the students reported distress levels above the cutoff  Year 1 students reported significantly higher levels of distress  anxiety and depression than students during their second to fourth year of studies  48 3  of the students indicated a decrease in their study motivation since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic with significant differences between study years  The binary logistic regression model showed that male gender  being in study year 2  higher distress scores and higher symptoms of depression were significantly associated with a higher likelihood for experiencing serious worries  In the open-ended questions on current concerns related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their studies  students most frequently reported concerns about missing relevant practical learning experience  difficulties with self-regulated learning and self motivation as well as study-related worries  Year 4 students reported significantly more worries about the lack of practical training than students from study years 1 to 3  Analysis of gender differences showed that female students reported more frequently diverse worries  In contrast  female students shared more frequently helpful strategies in all the categories compared to male students  Our findings suggest that medical students experience significant levels of distress and mental burden during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for ongoing psychological and educational support for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and after,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975624
2750,The persistent circulation of SARS-CoV-2 represents an ongoing global threat due to the emergence of new viral variants that can sometimes evade the immune system of previously exposed or vaccinated individuals  We conducted a follow-up study of adult individuals that had received an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  evaluating antibody production and neutralizing activity over a period of 6 months  In addition  we performed mice immunization with inactivated SARS-CoV-2  and evaluated the immune response and pathological outcomes against Gamma and Zeta variant infection  Vaccinated individuals produced high levels of antibodies with robust neutralizing activity  which was significantly reduced against Gamma and Zeta variants  Production of IgG anti-S antibodies and neutralizing activity robustly reduced after 6 months of vaccination  Immunized mice demonstrated cellular response against Gamma and Zeta variants  and after viral infection  reduced viral loads  IL-6 expression  and histopathological outcome in the lungs  TNF levels were unchanged in immunized or not immunized mice after infection with the Gamma variant  Furthermore  serum neutralization activity rapidly increases after infection with the Gamma and Zeta variants  Our data suggest that immunization with inactivated WT SARS-CoV-2 induces a promptly responsive cross-reactive immunity response against the Gamma and Zeta variants  reducing COVID-19 pathological outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960708
3438,Testing and vaccination have been major components of the strategy for combating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  In this study  we have developed a quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike  S1  IgG antibody assay using a fingerstick dried blood sample  We evaluated the feasibility of using this high-throughput and quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike  S1  IgG antibody testing assay in vaccinated individuals  Fingerstick blood samples were collected and analyzed from 137 volunteers before and after receiving the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine  Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG antibody could not be detected within the first 7 days after receiving the first vaccine dose  however  the assay reliably detected antibodies from day 14 onwards  In addition  no anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid  N  protein IgG antibody was detected in any of the vaccinated or healthy participants  indicating that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG assay is specific for the mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies  The S1 IgG levels detected in fingerstick samples correlated with the levels found in venous blood plasma samples and with the efficacy of venous blood plasma samples in the plaque reduction neutralization test  PRNT   The assay displayed a limit of quantification  LOQ  of 0 59 mug mL and was found to be linear in the range of 0 51-1000 mug mL  Finally  its clinical performance displayed a Positive Percent Agreement  PPA  of 100   95  CI  0 89-1 00  and a Negative Percent Agreement  NPA  of 100   95  CI  0 93-1 00   In summary  the assay described here represents a sensitive  precise  accurate  and simple method for the quantitative detection and monitoring of post-vaccination anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG responses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951566

7619,INTRODUCTION  Acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  is a severe form of acute lung injury  ALI  resulting in life-threatening hypoxaemia  Although ARDS can be caused by a variety of pathogens or major trauma  it is best known as the major cause of mortality in COVID-19 patients  Since ARDS is often associated with dysregulated inflammatory immune responses  immunomodulatory approaches represent a possible treatment option  The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of interleukin  IL -1 blockade using Anakinra in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide  LPS -induced ALI  METHODS  We evaluated the effects of a daily subcutaneous Anakinra treatment in a mouse model of LPS-induced ALI  We monitored body weight to assess the general health status of the mice  Two days after ALI induction  we evaluated the inflammatory cytokine MIP-2 as well as protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage  BAL  fluids  Two and nine days after ALI induction  we evaluated infiltrating leukocytes in BAL fluid and lung tissue  RESULTS  Anakinra treatment reduced ALI-induced weight loss compared to nontreated groups  At Day 2  Anakinra treatment reduced levels of MIP-2 and protein in BAL fluids and reduced frequencies of NK cells and neutrophils in the lung tissue  Nine days after ALI induction  Anakinra treated mice displayed reduced levels of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in BAL fluids  CONCLUSIONS  IL-1 blockade using Anakinra reduced classical hallmarks of inflammation in a mouse model of ALI  Our data support ongoing and future research on the evaluation of Anakinra as a potential treatment option in ARDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889061
2392,Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its protocols  states have legal obligations to address the climate crisis  The principle of participation is increasingly acknowledged as central to the protection and promotion of human rights  including the right to health  This paper explores states  obligations to address the climate crisis-and concomitant health crises-from a right to health perspective  The right to health lens provides a valuable opportunity for engaging diverse civil society constituencies in the response to the climate crisis  However  civic space must be protected if these actors are to participate meaningfully  The climate crisis discourse has lacked an explicit recognition of the interconnected nature of the right to health  environmental degradation and climate change  and civic space  There is also concern that restrictions on civic space will continue after the COVID-19 pandemic  While the public health community is an important constituency in the design and implementation of laws  policies  and programs to address climate change  the human rights literacy of this community remains to be strengthened  This paper addresses these lacunae within the context of the right to health as enshrined in United Nations human rights treaties and related international law,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966229
1321,BACKGROUND  In the City of Vancouver  Canada  non-profit food hubs such as food banks  neighbourhood houses  community centres  and soup kitchens serve communities that face food insecurity  Food that is available yet inaccessible cannot ensure urban food security  This study seeks to highlight food access challenges  especially in terms of mobility and transportation  faced by users of non-profit food hubs in the City of Vancouver before and during the COVID-19 crisis  METHODS  This study involved an online survey  n   84  and semi-structured follow-up key informant interviews  n   10  with individuals at least 19 years old who accessed food at a non-profit food hub located in the City of Vancouver more than once before and during the COVID-19 crisis  RESULTS  88 5  of survey respondents found food obtained from non-profit food hubs to be either very or somewhat important to their household s overall diet  In their journey to access food at non-profit food hubs in the City of Vancouver  many survey respondents face barriers such as transportation distance time  transportation inconveniences reliability accessibility  transportation costs  line-ups at non-profit food hubs  and schedules of non-profit food hubs  Comments from interview participants corroborate these barriers  CONCLUSIONS  Drawing from the findings  this study recommends that non-profit food hubs maintain a food delivery option and that the local transportation authority provides convenient and reliable paratransit service  Furthermore  this study recommends that the provincial government considers subsidizing transit passes for low-income households  that the provincial and or federal governments consider bolstering existing government assistance programs  and that the federal government considers implementing a universal basic income  This study emphasizes how the current two-tier food system perpetuates stigma and harms the well-being of marginalized populations in the City of Vancouver in their journey to obtain food,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983466
6399,INTRODUCTION  Argatroban is licensed for patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and is conventionally monitored by activated partial thromboplastin time  APTT  ratio  The target range is 1 5 to 3 0 times the patients  baseline APTT and not exceeding 100 s  however this baseline is not always known  APTT is known to plateau at higher levels of argatroban  and is influenced by coagulopathies  lupus anticoagulant and raised FVIII levels  It has been used as a treatment for COVID-19 and Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis  VITT   Some recent publications have favored the use of anti-IIa methods to determine the plasma drug concentration of argatroban  METHODS  Plasma of 60 samples from 3 COVID-19 patients and 54 samples from 5 VITT patients were tested by APTT ratio and anti-IIa method  dilute thrombin time dTT   Actin FS APTT ratios were derived from the baseline APTT of the patient and the mean normal APTT  RESULTS  Mean APTT ratio derived from baseline was 1 71  COVID-19   1 33  VITT  compared to APTT ratio by mean normal 1 65  COVID-19   1 48  VITT   dTT mean concentration was 0 64 microg ml  COVID-19  0 53 microg ml  VITT  with poor correlations to COVID-19 baseline APTT ratio r 2    0 1526 p <0 0001  mean normal r 2    0 2188 p < 0 0001  VITT baseline APTT ratio r 2    0 04 p < 0 001  VITT mean normal r 2    0 0064 p < 0 001  CONCLUSIONS  We believe that dTT is a superior method to monitor the concentration of argatroban  we have demonstrated significant differences between APTT ratios and dTT levels  which could have clinical impact  This is especially so in COVID-19 and VITT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905962
3154,SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in saliva serve as first line of defense against the virus  They are present in the mucosa  more precisely in saliva  after a recovered infection and also following vaccination  We report here the antibody persistence in plasma and in saliva up to 15 months after mild COVID-19  The IgG antibody response was measured every two months in 72 participants using an established and validated in-house ELISA assay  In addition  the virus inhibitory activity of plasma antibodies was assessed in a surrogate virus neutralization test before and after vaccination  SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody concentrations remained stable in plasma and saliva and the response was strongly boosted after one dose COVID-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956236
1224,Seroepidemiological studies to monitor antibody kinetics are important for assessing the extent and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population  Noninvasive sampling methods are advantageous for reducing the need for venipuncture  which may be a barrier to investigations  particularly in pediatric populations  Oral fluids are obtained by gingiva-crevicular sampling from children and adults and are very well accepted  Enzyme immunoassays  EIAs  based on these samples have acceptable sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional serum-based antibody EIAs and are suitable for population-based surveillance  We describe the development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IgG EIAs using SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein  NP  and spike  S  proteins in IgG isotype capture format and an indirect receptor-binding-domain  RBD  IgG EIA  intended for use in children as a primary endpoint  All three assays were assessed using a panel of 1 999 paired serum and oral fluids from children and adults participating in school SARS-CoV-2 surveillance studies during and after the first and second pandemic wave in the United Kingdom  The anti-NP IgG capture assay was the best candidate  with an overall sensitivity of 75   95  confidence interval  CI   71 to 79   and specificity of 99   95  CI  78 to 99   compared with paired serum antibodies  Sensitivity observed in children  80   95  CI  71 to 88   was higher than that in adults  67   CI  60  to 74    Oral fluid assays  OF  using spike protein and RBD antigens were also 99  specific and achieved reasonable but lower sensitivity in the target population  78   95  CI  68  to 86   and 53   95  CI  43  to 64    respectively   IMPORTANCE We report on the first large-scale assessment of the suitability of oral fluids for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody obtained from healthy children attending school  The sample type  gingiva-crevicular fluid  which is a transudate of blood but is not saliva  can be self collected  Although detection of antibodies in oral fluids is less sensitive than that in blood  our study suggests an optimal format for operational use  The laboratory methods we have developed can reliably measure antibodies in children  who are able to take their own samples  Our findings are of immediate practical relevance for use in large-scale seroprevalence studies designed to measure exposure to infection  as they typically require venipuncture  Overall  our data indicate that OF assays based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are a tool suitable for population-based seroepidemiology studies in children and highly acceptable in children and adults  as venipuncture is no longer necessary,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985331
8511,The threat of diseases varies considerably among individuals  and it has been found to be linked to various proactive or reactive behaviors  In the present studies  we investigated the impact of individual differences in the perceived vulnerability to disease  PVD  on social touch before  Study 1  or during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  Study 2   We also investigated the influence of personality traits in the covariation between these two dimensions  We found that people who are the most disease-avoidant are also the most reluctant to touching or being touched by others  and this relationship holds when personality traits are taken into account   Interestingly  the association between PVD and social touch increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with a few months before  By showing that the fear of contamination has an association with social touch  the findings provide further evidence for the behavioral immune system   Schaller and Park  2011   a psychological system acting as a first line of defense against pathogens,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874187
737,BACKGROUND  People are now connected in a borderless web-based world  The modern public  especially the younger generation  relies heavily on the internet as the main source of health-related information  In health care  patients can use social media for more tailored uses such as telemedicine  finding a provider  and for peer support  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this narrative review is to discuss how social media has been used in the health care industry from the perspective of patients and describe the main issues surrounding its use in health care  METHODS  Between March and June 2020  a review of the literature was conducted on PubMed  Google Scholar  and Web of Science for English studies that were published since 2007 and discussed the use of social media in health care  In addition to only English publications that discussed the use of social media by patients  publications pertaining to ethical and legal considerations in the use of social media were included  The studies were then categorized as health information  telemedicine  finding a health care provider  peer support and sharing experiences  and influencing positive health behavior  In addition  two more sections were added to the review  issues pertaining to social media use in health care and ethical considerations  RESULTS  Initially  75 studies were included  As the study proceeded  more studies were included  and a total of 91 studies were reviewed  complemented by 1 textbook chapter and 13 web references  Approximately half of the studies were reviews  The first study was published in 2009  and the last was published in 2021  with more than half of the studies published in the last 5 years  The studies were mostly from the United States  n 40   followed by Europe  n 13   and the least from India  n 1   WhatsApp or WeChat was the most investigated social media platform  CONCLUSIONS  Social media can be used by the public and patients to improve their health and knowledge  However  due diligence must be practiced to assess the credibility of the information obtained and its source  Health care providers  patients  and the public need not forget the risks associated with the use of social media  The limitations and shortcomings of the use of social media by patients should be understood,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994706
9103,Cities  due to population density and the complexity of human interactions  experience specific problems arising from their functioning in the era of the Covid-19 pandemic  Many scientists who publish their findings in contemporary literature agree on the need to shape pandemic resilient cities by making changes to the functional-spatial structure and preparing cities for rapid revitalization  regeneration  in the post-pandemic period  The main objective of the research is to identify the most important problems regarding service infrastructure deficiencies in the nine medium-sized Polish cities selected for research located in the Warsaw agglomeration  which are well connected with Warsaw  The research was based on  analysis of selected GIS spatial data  demographic data from the Polish Central Statistical Office  surveys among residents  on their needs during pandemic constraints  The focus was on three important aspects of development in the era of the pandemic  access to first-need services  access to greenery and active recreation areas  accessibility and transport efficiency problems  The research revealed changes in the way people travel and do their essential shopping  inadequate cycling infrastructure and problems with the availability of essential services close to where they live  The research programme varies  although the diagnosis and the possibility of transforming the functional-spatial structure of the cities studied as typical medium-sized cities in the impact zone of a large centre dominate  The conclusions provide examples of proposals for tactical urbanism planning solutions that could rapidly improve the quality of residence in a low-budget way  Finally  the proposals and guidelines for creating sustainable pandemic resilient cities are described  The article investigates the aspect of urban resilience related to transport  services  relaxation  while using the method of tactical urbanism as a remedy for cities  pandemic problems,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866737
3091,Objective  To discuss the consideration of performing radical cystectomy for rhabdomyosarcoma in children during the COVID-19 pandemic in the urology department of Adam Malik Hospital  Medan  Introduction  Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare malignancy that develops from primitive mesenchymal stem cells  The gold standard for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma is radical cystectomy  However  during the COVID-19 pandemic  radical cystectomy becomes a concern due to the risk of virus transmission  This article reported a patient who underwent radical cystectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic  Case presentation  A five-year-old female child was admitted to the hospital with chief complaints of bloody urine 1 month before admission  A month before hospital admission  the patient had pain during urination and was treated with radical cystectomy with Abol-Enein pouch modification  Result  After the surgery  the patient was able to urinate without any disturbance  Hematuria was not found  There was no complaint related to stricture of the ureter after the surgery  Conclusion  In our center  radical cystectomy could be performed in child with bladder rhabdomyosarcoma during COVID-19 pandemic  The procedure is considered a high priority therapy in most regions during COVID-19 pandemic  Abol-Enein technique after radical cystectomy resulted in improvement of symptom with no reported complication in our case,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956826
3037,Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARS-CoV-1  attaches to the host cell surface to initiate the interaction between the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of its spike glycoprotein  S  and the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme  hACE2  receptor  SARS-CoV-1 mutates frequently because of its RNA genome  which challenges the antiviral development  Here  we per-formed computational saturation mutagenesis of the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 to identify the residues crucial for its functions  We used the structure-based energy calculations to analyze the effects of the missense mutations on the SARS-CoV-1 S stability and the binding affinity with hACE2  The sequence and structure alignment showed similarities between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2  Interestingly  we found that target mutations of S protein amino acids generate similar effects on their stabilities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2  For example  G839W of SARS-CoV-1 corresponds to G857W of SARS-CoV-2  which decrease the stability of their S glycoproteins  The viral mutation analysis of the two different SARS-CoV-1 isolates showed that mutations  T487S and L472P  weakened the S-hACE2 binding of the 2003-2004 SARS-CoV-1 isolate  In addition  the mutations of L472P and F360S destabilized the 2003-2004 viral isolate  We further predicted that many mutations on N-linked glycosylation sites would increase the stability of the S glycoprotein  Our results can be of therapeutic importance in the design of antivirals or vaccines against SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957216

1359,Pandemic management requires reliable and efficient dynamical simulation to predict and control disease spreading  The COVID-19  SARS-CoV-2  pandemic is mitigated by several non-pharmaceutical interventions  but it is hard to predict which of these are the most effective for a given population  We developed the computationally effective and scalable  agent-based microsimulation framework PanSim  allowing us to test control measures in multiple infection waves caused by the spread of a new virus variant in a city-sized societal environment using a unified framework fitted to realistic data  We show that vaccination strategies prioritising occupational risk groups minimise the number of infections but allow higher mortality while prioritising vulnerable groups minimises mortality but implies an increased infection rate  We also found that intensive vaccination along with non-pharmaceutical interventions can substantially suppress the spread of the virus  while low levels of vaccination  premature reopening may easily revert the epidemic to an uncontrolled state  Our analysis highlights that while vaccination protects the elderly from COVID-19  a large percentage of children will contract the virus  and we also show the benefits and limitations of various quarantine and testing scenarios  The uniquely detailed spatio-temporal resolution of PanSim allows the design and testing of complex  specifically targeted interventions with a large number of agents under dynamically changing conditions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982766
6672,BACKGROUND  Hospital capacity strain impacts quality of care and hospital throughput and may also impact the well being of clinical staff and teams as well as their ability to do their job  Institutions have implemented a wide array of tactics to help manage hospital capacity strain with variable success  OBJECTIVE  Through qualitative interviews  our study explored interventions used to address hospital capacity strain and the perceived impact of these interventions  as well as how hospital capacity strain impacts patients  the workforce  and other institutional priorities  DESIGN  SETTING  AND PARTICIPANTS  Qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews at 13 large urban academic medical centers across the USA from June 21  2019  to August 22  2019  pre-COVID-19   Interviews were recorded  professionally transcribed verbatim  coded  and then analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive method at the semantic level  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Themes and subthemes of semi-structured interviews were identified  RESULTS  Twenty-nine hospitalist leaders and hospital leaders were interviewed  Across the 13 sites  a multitude of provider  care team  and institutional tactics were implemented with perceived variable success  While there was some agreement between hospitalist leaders and hospital leaders  there was also some disagreement about the perceived successes of the various tactics deployed  We found three main themes   1  hospital capacity strain is complex and difficult to predict   2  the interventions that were perceived to have worked the best when facing strain were to ensure appropriate resources  however  less costly solutions were often deployed and this may lead to unanticipated negative consequences  and  3  hospital capacity strain and the tactics deployed may negatively impact the workforce and can lead to conflict  CONCLUSIONS  While institutions have employed many different tactics to manage hospital capacity strain and see this as a priority  tactics seen as having the highest yield are often not the first employed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902096
4952,Numerous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  tests have emerged over the past year as the gold standard for detecting millions of cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported daily worldwide  However  problems with critical shortages of key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits and unpredictable test reliability related to high viral replication cycles have triggered the need for alternative methodologies to PCR to detect specific COVID-19 proteins  Several authors have developed methods based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  LC-MS MS  to confirm the potential of the technique to detect two major proteins  the spike and the nucleoprotein  of COVID-19  In the present work  an S-Trap mini spin column digestion protocol was used for sample preparation prodromal to LC-MS MS analysis in multiple reactions monitoring ion mode  MRM  to obtain a comprehensive method capable of detecting different viral proteins  The developed method was applied to n  81 oro nasopharyngeal swabs submitted in parallel to quantitative reverse transcription PCR  RT-qPCR  assays to detect RdRP  the S and N genes specific for COVID-19  and the E gene for all Sarbecoviruses  including SARS-CoV-2  with cycle negativity threshold set to 40   A total of 23 peptides representative of the six specific viral proteins were detected in the monitoring of 128 transitions found to have good ionic currents extracted in clinical samples that reacted differently to the PCR assay  The best instrumental response came from the FLPFQFGR sequence of spike  558-566  peptide used to test the analytical performance of the method that has good sensitivity with a low false-negative rate  Transition monitoring using a targeted MS approach has the great potential to detect the fragmentation reactions of any peptide molecularly defined by a specific amino acid sequence  offering the extensibility of the approach to any viral sequence including derived variants and thus providing insights into the development of new types of clinical diagnostics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926968
8598,The research aims to examine the vulnerability and resilience of road transport enterprises in Poland to a crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic  In theory  we refer to the Schumpeterian perspective of creative destruction  In the empirical analysis  survey data on 500 transport companies randomly selected from the database were used  We estimated partial proportional odds models to show the factors responsible for the enterprises  vulnerability and resilience to unforeseen shock  The perspective refers to the total sample size and the division into two subgroups  micro and small and medium enterprises  To justify the results  we calculated a set of statistical indicators and tests  These models enable separating enterprises according to the vulnerability level  Transport enterprises occurred significantly vulnerable to the COVID-19 crisis  particularly the demand shock  The only factor that influenced resilience was the decrease in fuel prices  which allowed a cost reduction  The crisis showed that government aid was helpful in the short run  particularly for micro and small enterprises  The medium-sized enterprises were more resilient than micro and small ones  We formulated several recommendations to help transport enterprises to adjust in the medium term,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873349

5053,Background  Despite the worldwide spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2  SARS-CoV-2   information about the epidemiological and clinical patterns of this infection is still largely unknown in children  In addition  the prevalence of this disease is still very high in some parts of the world  including Iran  Thus  this study aims to evaluate the epidemiological features  laboratory and imaging findings  and the type of treatments in children with novel coronavirus 2019  COVID-19   Method  This study is conducted from March 2020-March 2021 by using the medical records of hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 children younger than 18 years in five cities of Iran  Tehran  Ahwaz  Isfahan  Bandar-Abbas  and Khorramabad  In addition to demographic and epidemiological data  we also studied clinical signs and treatments  Results  In total 278 confirmed COVID-19 children  the average age was 5 3 years  and 59 4 were boys  A total of 37 8  had an underlying disease  in which the most common was a malignancy  The most common symptoms were fever and cough  In this group of pediatrics  some abnormal laboratory findings have been seen  GGO  Ground-Glass Opacity  had been diagnosed in 58 6  of children  3 6  needed oxygen therapy with ventilators  and 83 09  had received antibiotic treatments with the majority of ceftriaxone  Also  10  had got steroids  In this study  the mortality rate was 4 3   Conclusion  In this study  most of the children who died had an underlying disease  so timely care and action is important in them  Most children admitted to our study received antibiotics and were prescribed antivirals and steroids for a smaller number  Also  a small number of children received oxygen therapy  most of whom were in the age group of 1 to 5 years,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925657
7614,The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the social  economic  and health care systems in the United States and shined a spotlight on the burden of disease associated with social determinants of health  SDOH   Addressing SDOH  while a challenge  provides important opportunities to mitigate cardiovascular disease incidence  morbidity  and mortality  We present a conceptual framework to examine the differential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on SDOH across demographically diverse populations  focusing on the short- and long-term development of cardiovascular disease  as well as future research opportunities for cardiovascular disease prevention  The COVID-19 pandemic exerted negative shifts in SDOH and cardiovascular risk factors  ie  smoking  body mass index  physical activity  dietary behavior  cholesterol  blood pressure  and blood sugar   For example  evidence suggests that unemployment and food insecurity have increased  whereas health care access and income have decreased  changes to SDOH have resulted in increases in loneliness and processed food consumption  as well as decreases in physical activity and hypertension management  We found that policy measures enacted to mitigate economic  social  and health issues inadequately protected populations  Low-income and racial and ethnic minority communities  historically underserved populations  were not only disproportionately adversely affected by the pandemic but also less likely to receive assistance  likely attributable in part to the deep structural inequities pervasive in our society  Effective and culturally appropriate interventions are needed to mitigate the negative health impacts of historical systems  policies  and programs that created and maintain structural racism  especially for immigrants  racial and ethnic minorities  and populations experiencing social disadvantage,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889110
2006,BACKGROUND AIM  This study analyzed the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 with major events during the first days of hospitalization  PATIENTS AND METHODS  This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from consecutive patients admitted to two hospitals in Athens  Greece  The characteristics of patients with COVID-19 who suffered the primary endpoint  venous thromboembolic events  intubation  and death  during the first days of hospitalization were analyzed  RESULTS  Among 95 patients included in the analysis  21 presented with major adverse events during a median follow-up of 13 days  More than 50  of these patients presented with a major event during the first 3 days  Anticoagulation treatment was inversely associated with the cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint  hazard ratio 0 16  95  confidence interval 0 06-0 47    Patients with major events were older  with lower baseline SatO2  and higher number of Wells  criteria and Charlson comorbidity index  Among these patients  those with hypertension were at higher risk for early occurrence of events  <   first three days of hospitalization   CONCLUSION  Major adverse events may occur early in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a high-risk profile  Anticoagulation treatment appears to reduce this risk and thus prompt thromboprophylaxis should be employed in these patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972738
4238,BACKGROUND  Numbers of clinical documentation integrity specialists  CDIS  and CDI programs have increased rapidly  CDIS review patient records concurrently with patient admissions and visits to ensure that information is accurate  complete and non-ambiguous  and query clinicians when they see opportunities for improving data  The occupation was initially focused on improving data for reimbursement  but rapid changes to clinical coding requirements  technologies and payment systems led to a quickly evolving role for CDI programs and changes in CDIS practice  OBJECTIVE  This case study seeks to uncover the ongoing innovation and adaptation occurring in a CDI program by tracing the evolution of a single CDI program over time  METHOD  We present a case study of the CDI program at the HonorHealth hospital system in Arizona  RESULTS  The HonorHealth CDI program holds a unique hybrid expertise and role within the healthcare organisation that allows it to rapidly adapt to support emergent demands both internal and external to the organisation  such as supporting accurate data collection for the COVID-19 pandemic  CONCLUSION  CDIS are a vital component in present data-intensive resourcing efforts  The hybrid expertise of CDIS and capacity for adaption and relationship building has enabled the HonorHealth CDI program to adapt rapidly to meet a growing array of clinical documentation integrity needs  including emergent needs during the COVID-19 pandemic  IMPLICATIONS  The HonorHealth case study can guide other CDI programs in adaptation of the CDI role and practices in response to changing organisational needs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937409
4132,Background and Objective  Since December 2019  coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has spread rapidly around the world  Studies found that the incidence of acute kidney injury  AKI  in COVID-19 patients was more than double the incidence of AKI in non-COVID-19 patients  Some findings confirmed that AKI is a strong independent risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19 and is associated with a three-fold increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality  However  little information is available about AKI in COVID-19 patients  This study aimed to analyse the risk factors for AKI in adult patients with COVID-19  Methods  A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed  EMBASE  Web of Science  the Cochrane Library  CNKI  VIP and WanFang Data from 1 December 2019 to 30 January 2021  We extracted data from eligible studies to compare the effects of age  sex  chronic diseases and potential risk factors for AKI on the prognosis of adult patients with COVID-19  Results  In total  38 studies with 42 779 patients were included in this analysis  The meta-analysis showed that male sex  OR   1 37   older age  MD   5 63   smoking  OR   1 23   obesity  OR   1 12   hypertension  OR 1 85   diabetes  OR 1 71   pneumopathy  OR   1 36   cardiovascular disease  OR   1 98   cancer  OR   1 26   chronic kidney disease  CKD   OR   4 56   mechanical ventilation  OR   8 61  and the use of vasopressors  OR   8 33  were significant risk factors for AKI  P < 0 05   Conclusions  AKI is a common and serious complication of COVID-19  Overall  male sex  age  smoking  obesity  hypertension  diabetes  pneumopathy  cardiovascular disease  cancer  CKD  mechanical ventilation and the use of vasopressors were independent risk factors for AKI in adult patients with COVID-19  Clinicians need to be aware of these risk factors to reduce the incidence of AKI  System Review Registration  PROSPERO  identifier  CRD42021282233,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938742
3260,Wastewater-based epidemiology  WBE  has emerged as an effective environmental surveillance tool in monitoring fecal-oral pathogen infections within a community  Congruently  SARS-CoV-2  the etiologic agent of COVID-19  has been demonstrated to infect the gastrointestinal tissues  and be shed in feces  In the present study  SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater  sludge  surface water  ground water  sediment  and soil samples of municipal and hospital wastewater systems and related environments in Wuhan during the COVID-19 middle and low risk periods  and the viral RNA copies quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR   From the findings of this study  during the middle risk period  one influent sample and three secondary effluents collected from waste water treatment plant 2  as well as two samples from Jinyintan Hospital wastewater system influent were SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive  One sludge sample collected from Guanggu Branch of Tongji Hospital  which was obtained during the low risk period  was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  These study findings demonstrate the significance of WBE in continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level  even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low  Overall  this study can be used as an important reference for contingency management of wastewater treatment plants and COVID-19 prevention and control departments of Wuhan,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34955194
9709,The objective was to compare the profile and outcomes of older adults admitted to a geriatric short-stay unit for COVID-19  to those of older adults admitted to the same unit for seasonal influenza infection  This was an observational study performed in a General Hospital in France  Patients >   70 years admitted to a geriatric short-stay unit for COVID-19 between March 18 and November 15  2020 were included  They were compared with patients of the same age group  admitted to the same geriatric short-stay unit for seasonal influenza infection over the periods January to March 2019 and January to March 2020  Data collection included demographic information  medical history  clinical signs and symptoms  outcomes  and hospital discharge patterns  Descriptive and intergroup comparison analyses were performed  In total  153 patients were included in the study  82 in the seasonal influenza group  and 71 in the COVID-19 group  The average age was 87 6   - 4 8 and 87 6   - 6 5 years in the COVID-19 and seasonal influenza groups  respectively  There was no difference between groups regarding the Charlson comorbidity index  3 4   - 3 0 versus 3 4   - 2 8   The seasonal influenza group more often had fever  cough  sputum  and renal failure  whereas the COVID-19 group more often experienced diarrhea  and death  The COVID-19 group was frequently living in collective housing  The profile at admission of older adults hospitalized for COVID-19 or seasonal influenza infection was similar  Although fever and respiratory signs were less common in the COVID-19 group  these patients experienced more complications  such as renal failure or oxygen therapy requirement  and higher mortality,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856536
6076,This study aims to examine online learning effects regarding self-efficacy  generalized anxiety  and fear of COVID-19 on three distinct online learning satisfaction levels  low  moderate  and high  among university students  A cross-sectional survey was utilized for data collection between June 2020 and August 2020 to assess students  online self-efficacy  general anxiety  fear of COVID-19  and online learning satisfaction  The descriptive data analysis demonstrated a fundamental understanding of the gathered data results  Meanwhile  discriminant data analysis was employed to explore different online learning satisfaction levels following various study factors  The correlational analysis implied online learning self-efficacy to be significantly and positively associated with online learning satisfaction while general anxiety and fear of COVID-19 were significantly and negatively related to online learning satisfaction  The discriminant analysis revealed the emergence of three online learning satisfaction levels from online self-efficacy  general anxiety  and fear of COVID-19  This study theoretically justified the essentiality of online learning self-efficacy towards online learning satisfaction  High online learning satisfaction levels occurred with high online self-efficacy  moderate general anxiety  and low fear of COVID-19  Two discriminant functions  academic engagement and fear  were subsequently evolved  Academic engagement corresponded to online self-efficacy and general anxiety while fear was associated with COVID-19  In this vein  online learning self-efficacy and moderate general anxiety led to high online learning satisfaction  The fear of COVID-19 also required alleviation towards online learning satisfaction  For example  academicians and policymakers needed to focus on developing online self-efficacy and reducing the fear of COVID-19 for high online learning satisfaction,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909480
8578,In early 2020  unprecedented lockdowns and travel bans were implemented in Chinese mainland to fight COVID-19  which led to a large reduction in anthropogenic emissions  This provided a unique opportunity to isolate the effects from emission and meteorology on tropospheric nitrogen dioxide  NO2   Comparing the atmospheric NO2 in 2020 with that in 2017  we found the changes of emission have led to a 49 3   - 23 5  reduction  which was approximately 12  more than satellite-observed reduction of 37 8   - 16 3   The discrepancy was mainly a result of changes of meteorology  which have contributed to an 8 1   - 14 2  increase of NO2  We also revealed that the emission-induced reduction of NO2 has significantly negative correlations to human mobility  particularly that inside the city  The intra-city migration index derived from Baidu Location-Based-Service can explain 40 4    - 17 7  variance of the emission-induced reduction of NO2 in 29 megacities  each of which has a population of over 8 million in Chinese mainland,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873447

3128,In this review  we reveal the latest developments at the interface between SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell surface  In particular  we evaluate the current and potential mechanisms of binding  fusion and the conformational changes of the spike  S  protein to host cell surface receptors  especially the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor  For instance  upon the initial attachment  the receptor binding domain of the S protein forms primarily hydrogen bonds with the protease domain of ACE2 resulting in conformational changes within the secondary structure  These surface interactions are of paramount importance and have been therapeutically exploited for antiviral design  such as monoclonal antibodies  Additionally  we provide an insight into novel therapies that target viral non-structural proteins  such as viral RNA polymerase  An example of which is remdesivir which has now been approved for use in COVID-19 patients by the US Food and Drug Administration  Establishing further understanding of the molecular details at the cell surface will undoubtably aid the development of more efficacious and selectively targeted therapies to reduce the burden of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956606
5993,OBJECTIVE  This study aims to investigate the antibody response and the side effects of the two-dose inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine  CoronaVac  Sinovac  China  among a health care worker population in Turkey  METHODS  This study was a prospective  cross-sectional  single-center study conducted between December 16  2020  and March 15  2021  We evaluated the side effects from a questionnaire  and anti-spike immunoglobulin G response to the vaccine  0- and 28-day schedule  using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  RESULTS  A total of 94 of 184 health care workers completed this study  The percentages of participants who were seronegative at baseline and achieved to the seropositivity were 21 3 and 97 9   respectively  on day 21 after vaccinations  The seropositivity was predominantly detected in 31-45 years of the age group  55 4   p 0 636   normal body mass index  47 8   p 0 999   nonsmokers  64 1   p 0 999   those without any comorbidities  73 9   p 0 463   and those without any side effects  70 2   p 0 256   The frequencies of overall side effects within seven days after the first and second doses of CoronaVac were 37 2 and 28 7   respectively  The most common side effects was localized pain at the injection site  15 7 and 11 6   respectively   CONCLUSIONS  We found that vaccination by two-dose CoronaVac could elicit a specific humoral response  and it was well tolerated in health care workers  The high seropositivity developed after the second dose attracted attention  Our study will be useful in terms of showing short-term immunity and side effects,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909957
4793,BACKGROUND  Years of life lost  YLL  is recently used as a more insightful indicator to assess the mortality impact of COVID-19  However  this indicator still has methodological limits  This study aims to propose an alternative approach and new index  early-death weeks  METHODS  The natural mortality and social mortality laws were employed to support two essential assumptions  the sequential and translational early-mortality patterns of COVID-19  This approach was then used with the data related to COVID-19 to calculate early-death weeks associated with COVID-19 in France  the UK and the USA  RESULTS  As of week 20 of 2021  the rate of the total number of early-death weeks per the population of the USA is nearly two times compared to that of France and the UK  with 0 004  to 0 0021 and 0 0023   respectively  The average numbers of early-death weeks after converting to units of years are 1 2  1 0 and 1 3 years in France  the UK and the USA  respectively  CONCLUSIONS  The new approach is significantly different from death counts  excess deaths and YLL  The early-death week index provides more insights into COVID-19 and can be applied promptly at any time as well as anywhere once excess deaths have occurred,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929732
2532,Background  Chronic cough can be triggered by respiratory and non-respiratory tract illnesses originating mainly from the upper and lower airways  and the GI tract  ie  reflux   Recent findings suggest it can also be a prominent feature in obstructive sleep apnea  OSA   laryngeal hyperresponsiveness  and COVID-19  The classification of chronic cough is constantly updated but lacks clear definition  Epidemiological data on the prevalence of chronic cough are informative but highly variable  The underlying mechanism of chronic cough is a neurogenic inflammation of the cough reflex which becomes hypersensitive  thus the term hypersensitive cough reflex  HCR   A current challenge is to decipher how various infectious and inflammatory airway diseases and esophageal reflux  among others  modulate HCR  Objectives  The World Allergy Organization Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma  WAO ARIA  Joint Committee on Chronic Cough reviewed the current literature on classification  epidemiology  presenting features  and mechanistic pathways of chronic cough in airway- and reflux-related cough phenotypes  OSA  and COVID-19  The interplay of cough reflex sensitivity with other pathogenic mechanisms inherent to airway and reflux-related inflammatory conditions was also analyzed  Outcomes  Currently  it is difficult to clearly ascertain true prevalence rates in epidemiological studies of chronic cough phenotypes  This is likely due to lack of standardized objective measures needed for cough classification and frequent coexistence of multi-organ cough origins  Notwithstanding  we emphasize the important role of HCR as a mechanistic trigger in airway- and reflux-related cough phenotypes  Other concomitant mechanisms can also modulate HCR  including type2 Th1 Th2 inflammation  presence or absence of deep inspiration-bronchoprotective reflex  lower airways   tissue remodeling  and likely cough plasticity  among others,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963794
2221,In recent months  wastewater-based epidemiology  WBE  has been shown to be an important tool for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the population  In this study  a detection methodology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  wildtype and variants of concern  in wastewater was developed based on the detection of different target genes  E and ORF1ab  by polyethylene glycol  PEG  precipitation and digital droplet PCR  This methodology was used to determine the SARS-CoV-2 concentration and the proportion of N501Y mutation in raw sewage of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Karlsruhe in south-western Germany over a period of 1 year  June 2020 to July 2021   Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations with reported COVID-19 cases in the catchment area showed a significant correlation  As the clinical SARS-CoV-2 official case report chain takes time  viral RNA titre trends appeared more than 12 days earlier than clinical data  demonstrating the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology as an early warning system  Parallel PCR analysis using seven primer and probe systems revealed similar gene copy numbers with E  ORF  RdRP2 and NSP9 assays  RdPP1 and NSP3 generally resulted in lower copy numbers  and in particular for N1 there was low correlation with the other assays  The occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the wastewater of Karlsruhe was consistent with the occurrence of the alpha-variant  B 1 1 7  in the corresponding individual clinical tests  In batch experiments SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable for several days under anaerobic conditions  but the copy numbers decreased rapidly in the presence of dissolved oxygen  Overall  this study shows that wastewater-based epidemiology is a sensitive and robust approach to detect trends in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage  contributing to successful pandemic management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968879

4196,Systemic immune cell dynamics during coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  are extensively documented  but these are less well studied in the  upper  respiratory tract  where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  replicates 1-6   Here  we characterized nasal and systemic immune cells in individuals with COVID-19 who were hospitalized or convalescent and compared the immune cells to those seen in healthy donors  We observed increased nasal granulocytes  monocytes  CD11c    natural killer  NK  cells and CD4    T effector cells during acute COVID-19  The mucosal proinflammatory populations positively associated with peripheral blood human leukocyte antigen  HLA -DR low  monocytes  CD38   PD1   CD4    T effector  Teff  cells and plasmablasts  However  there was no general lymphopenia in nasal mucosa  unlike in peripheral blood  Moreover  nasal neutrophils negatively associated with oxygen saturation levels in blood  Following convalescence  nasal immune cells mostly normalized  except for CD127    granulocytes and CD38   CD8    tissue-resident memory T cells  TRM   SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8    T cells persisted at least 2 months after viral clearance in the nasal mucosa  indicating that COVID-19 has both transient and long-term effects on upper respiratory tract immune responses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937933
789,COVID-19 cases are increasing around the globe with almost 5 million of deaths  We propose here a deep learning model capable of predicting the duration of the infection by means of information available at hospital admission  A total of 222 patients were enrolled in our observational study  Anagraphical and anamnestic data  COVID-19 signs and symptoms  COVID-19 therapy  hematochemical test results  and prior therapies administered to patients are used as predictors  A set of 55 features  all of which can be taken in the first hours of the patient s hospitalization  was considered  Different solutions were compared achieving the best performance with a sequential convolutional neural network-based model merged in an ensemble with two different meta-learners linked in cascade  We obtained a median absolute error of 2 7 days  IQR   3 0  in predicting the duration of the infection  the error was equally distributed in the infection duration range  This tool could preemptively give an outlook of the COVID-19 patients  expected path and the associated hospitalization effort  The proposed solution could be viable in tackling the huge burden and the logistics complexity of hospitals or rehabilitation centers during the pandemic waves  With data taken ad admission  entering a PCA-based feature selection  a k-fold cross-validated CNN-based model was implemented  After external texting  a median absolute error of 2 7 days  IQR   3 days,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34993693
7853,Research  understanding  and prediction of complex systems is an important starting point for human beings to tackle major problems and emergencies such as global warming and COVID-19  Research on innovation ecosystem is an important part of research on complex systems  With the rapid development of sophisticated industries  the rise of innovative countries  and the newly developed innovation theory  innovation ecosystem has become a new explanation and new paradigm for adapting to today s global innovation cooperation network and the scientific development of complex systems  which is also in line with China s concept of building an innovative country and promoting comprehensive innovation and international cooperation with scientific and technological innovation as the core  The Innovative Research Group at Peking University is the most representative scientific and technological innovation team in the frontier field of basic research in China  The characteristics of its organization mechanism and dynamic evolution connotation are consistent with the characteristics and evolution of innovation ecosystem  An excellent innovative research group is regarded as a small innovation ecosystem  We selected the  Environmental Biogeochemistry  Innovation Research Group at Peking University as a typical case in order to understand and analyze the evolution of cooperation among scientific and technological innovation teams  improve the healthy development as well as internal and external governance of this special small innovation ecosystem  promote the expansion of an innovation team cooperation network and the improvement of cooperation quality  promote the linkage supports of funding and management departments  and improve their scientific and technological governance abilities  Through scientometrics  visual analysis of knowledge maps  and an exploratory case study  we study the evolution process and development law of team cooperation  It is found that the main node authors of the cooperation network maintain strong cooperation frequency and centrality  and gradually strengthen with the expansion of the cooperation network and the evolution of time  Driven by the internal cooperative governance of the team and the external governance of the funding and management departments  this group has gradually formed a healthy  orderly  open  and cooperative special innovation ecosystem  which is conducive to the stability and sustainable development of the national innovation ecosystem and the global innovation ecosystem,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886310
1831,Since its appearance  the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2   the causal agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19   represents a global problem for human health that involves the host lipid homeostasis  Regarding  lipid rafts are functional membrane microdomains with highly and tightly packed lipid molecules  These regions enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol recruit and concentrate several receptors and molecules involved in pathogen recognition and cellular signaling  Cholesterol-rich lipid rafts have multiple functions for viral replication  however  their role in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear  In this review  we discussed the novel evidence on the cholesterol-rich lipid rafts as a platform for SARS-CoV-2 entry  where receptors such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  ACE-2   heparan sulfate proteoglycans  HSPGs   human Toll-like receptors  TLRs   transmembrane serine proteases  TMPRSS   CD-147 and HDL-scavenger receptor B type 1  SR-B1  are recruited for their interaction with the viral spike protein  FDA-approved drugs such as statins  metformin  hydroxychloroquine  and cyclodextrins  methyl-beta-cyclodextrin  can disrupt cholesterol-rich lipid rafts to regulate key molecules in the immune signaling pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection  Taken together  better knowledge on cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the SARS-CoV-2-host interactions will provide valuable insights into pathogenesis and the identification of novel therapeutic targets,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975904
8614,OBJECTIVES  High-quality data are crucial for guiding decision-making and practising evidence-based healthcare  especially if previous knowledge is lacking  Nevertheless  data quality frailties have been exposed worldwide during the current COVID-19 pandemic  Focusing on a major Portuguese epidemiological surveillance dataset  our study aims to assess COVID-19 data quality issues and suggest possible solutions  SETTINGS  On 27 April 2020  the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health  DGS  made available a dataset  DGSApril  for researchers  upon request  On 4 August  an updated dataset  DGSAugust  was also obtained  PARTICIPANTS  All COVID-19-confirmed cases notified through the medical component of National System for Epidemiological Surveillance until end of June  PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES  Data completeness and consistency  RESULTS  DGSAugust has not followed the data format and variables as DGSApril and a significant number of missing data and inconsistencies were found  eg  4075 cases from the DGSApril were apparently not included in DGSAugust   Several variables also showed a low degree of completeness and or changed their values from one dataset to another  eg  the variable  underlying conditions  had more than half of cases showing different information between datasets   There were also significant inconsistencies between the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 shown in DGSAugust and by the DGS reports publicly provided daily  CONCLUSIONS  Important quality issues of the Portuguese COVID-19 surveillance datasets were described  These issues can limit surveillance data usability to inform good decisions and perform useful research  Major improvements in surveillance datasets are therefore urgently needed-for example  simplification of data entry processes  constant monitoring of data  and increased training and awareness of healthcare providers-as low data quality may lead to a deficient pandemic control,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34872992
9914,OBJECTIVES  To help people make decisions about the most effective mitigation measures against SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different scenarios  the likelihoods of transmission by different routes need to be quantified to some degree  however uncertain   These likelihoods need to be communicated in an appropriate way to illustrate the relative importance of different routes in different scenarios  the likely effectiveness of different mitigation measures along those routes  and the level of uncertainty in those estimates  In this study  a pragmatic expert elicitation was undertaken to supply the underlying quantitative values to produce such a communication tool  PARTICIPANTS  Twenty-seven individual experts from five countries and many scientific disciplines provided estimates  OUTCOME MEASURES  Estimates of transmission parameters  assessments of the quality of the evidence  references to relevant literature  rationales for their estimates and sources of uncertainty  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION  The participants  responses showed that there is still considerable disagreement among experts about the relative importance of different transmission pathways and the effectiveness of different mitigation measures due to a lack of empirical evidence  Despite these disagreements  when pooled  the majority views on each parameter formed an internally consistent set of estimates  for example  that transmission was more likely indoors than outdoors  and at closer range   which formed the basis of a visualisation to help individuals and organisations understand the factors that influence transmission and the potential benefits of different mitigation measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853105
230,The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a transition to remote delivery of courses that lack immersive hands-on research experiences for undergraduate science students  resulting in a scientific research skills gap  In this report  we present an option for an inclusive and authentic  hands-on research experience that all students can perform off-campus  Biology students in a semester-long  13 weeks  sophomore plant physiology course participated in an at-home laboratory designed to study the impacts of nitrogen addition on growth rates and root nodulation by wild nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia in Pisum sativum  Pea  plants  This undergraduate research experience  piloted in the fall semester of 2020 in a class with 90 students  was created to help participants learn and practice scientific research skills during the COVID-19 pandemic  Specifically  the learning outcomes associated with this at-home research experience were   1  generate a testable hypothesis   2  design an experiment to test the hypothesis   3  explain the importance of biological replication   4  perform meaningful statistical analyses using R  and  5  compose a research paper to effectively communicate findings to a general biology audience  Students were provided with an at-home laboratory kit containing the required materials and reagents  which were chosen to be accessible and affordable in case students were unable to access our laboratory kit  Students were guided through all aspects of research  including hypothesis generation  data collection  and data analysis  with video tutorials and live virtual sessions  This at-home laboratory provided students an opportunity to practice hands-on research with the flexibility to collect and analyze their own data in a remote setting during the COVID-19 pandemic  This  or similar laboratories  could also be used as part of distance learning biology courses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003623
2144,Objective  Abrupt life changes imposed by the lockdown measures  with a direct impact on teaching methodology and social interactions  as well as sleeping patterns  harmed university students  mental health  This study aimed to analyze the relationship between satisfaction with online teaching  social interaction with depression  anxiety symptomatology  and to analyze the effects of the pandemic and the lockdown in mental care access  Methods  The online survey collected demographic data  satisfaction with online teaching  and social interaction  We evaluated the depression and anxiety symptomatology using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder  respectively  For the PHQ-9  we used the cut-off 15 for moderately severe depressive symptoms  whereas for GAD-7  we recurred to the cut-off 10 for moderately severe anxiety symptoms  This study used three data points  October 2019  June 2020  and March 2021  Findings  The study included n   366 participants from all university study fields  with a mean age of 21 71  SD   1 42  in the last survey  and 71 3  were women  Depressive symptoms increased significantly from October 2019 to June 2020  and the mean scores grew until March 2021  Anxiety symptoms also significantly increased from October 2019 to June 2020  however  from June 2020 to March 2021  there was a non-significant decrease in the proportion  Mean scores for satisfaction with online teaching were 38 23  in June 2020 and 34 25  in March 2021  a non-significant difference  Satisfaction with social interaction significantly decreased from 37 35  in 2020 to 24 41  in 2021  Participants with scores above the cut-off of moderately severe and severe depressive and anxiety symptoms showed significantly lower satisfaction with online teaching than students with lower depression and anxiety scores  Despite the significant increase in clinical symptomatology  help-seeking behaviors did not change accordingly  and more than 50  of the students with mild or severe depressive and anxiety symptomatology did not get treatment during the pandemic  Conclusion  The findings of this study suggest that most students are dissatisfied with online teaching and the type of social interaction they were forced to adopt because of the pandemic  The severity of depressive and anxiety symptomatology significantly increased between October 2019 and March 2021  but help-seeking behaviors did not increase accordingly,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970167
5920,Cohort studies have displayed mixed findings on changes in mental symptoms severity in 2020  when the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak started  Network approaches can provide additional insights by analyzing the connectivity of such symptoms  We assessed the network structure of mental symptoms in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Health  ELSA-Brasil  in 3 waves  2008-2010  2017-2019  and 2020  and hypothesized that the 2020 network would present connectivity changes  We used the Clinical Interview Scheduled-Revised  CIS-R  questionnaire to evaluates the severity of 14 common mental symptoms  Networks were graphed using unregularized Gaussian models and compared using centrality and connectivity measures  The predictive power of centrality measures and individual symptoms were also estimated  Among 2011 participants  mean age  62 1 years  58  females   the pandemic symptom 2020 network displayed higher overall connectivity  especially among symptoms that were related to general worries  with increased local connectivity between general worries and worries about health  as well as between anxiety and phobia symptoms  There was no difference between 2008 and 2010 and 2017-2019 networks  According to the network theory of mental disorders  external factors could explain why the network structure became more densely connected in 2020 compared to previous observations  We speculate that the COVID-19 pandemic and its innumerous social  economical  and political consequences were prominent external factors driving such changes  although further assessments are warranted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34911001

3297,BACKGROUND  Many patients who are diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  suffer from venous thromboembolic complications despite the use of stringent anticoagulant prophylaxis  Studies on the exact mechanism s  underlying thrombosis in COVID-19 are limited as animal models commonly used to study venous thrombosis pathophysiology  i e  rats and mice  are naturally not susceptible to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Ferrets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection  successfully used to study virus transmission  and have been previously used to study activation of coagulation and thrombosis during influenza virus infection  OBJECTIVES  This study aimed to explore the use of  heat-inactivated  plasma and lung material from SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets studying COVID-19-associated changes in coagulation and thrombosis  MATERIAL AND METHODS  Histology and longitudinal plasma profiling using mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach was performed  RESULTS  Lungs of ferrets inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated alveolar septa that were mildly expanded by macrophages  and diffuse interstitial histiocytic pneumonia  However  no macroscopical or microscopical evidence of vascular thrombosis in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets was found  Longitudinal plasma profiling revealed minor differences in plasma protein profiles in SARS-CoV-2-inoculated ferrets up to 2 weeks post-infection  The majority of plasma coagulation factors were stable and demonstrated a low coefficient of variation  CONCLUSIONS  We conclude that while ferrets are an essential and well-suited animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 transmission  their use to study SARS-CoV-2-related changes relevant to thrombotic disease is limited,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954402
6200,Background  The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered our life  Doctors more so than the general public because of their involvement in managing the COVID-infected individuals  some of them 24 7 end in burnout  Burnout in doctors can lead to reduced care of patients  increased medical errors  and poor health  Burnout among frontline health-care workers has become a major problem in this ongoing epidemic  On the other hand  doctors in preclinical department have a lack of interaction with patients  with not much nonclinical professional work to boot  find the profession less gratifying which perhaps increase their stress level  Aim  The aim was to study the prevalence of burnout and measure resilience in doctors in clinical and in preclinical departments  Materials and Methods  This observational  cross-sectional  comparative study was carried out in a tertiary care teaching hospital and COVID care center  By purposive sampling 60 preclinical and 60 clinical doctors in a tertiary health care center were included in the study  After obtaining the Institutional Ethics Committee approval and informed consent  the doctors were administered a self made socio-demographic questionnaire  the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory  and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale  Doctors were given a self-made questionnaire  the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory  and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale  Results  The prevalence of burnout was seen more in clinical doctors  55 47  and the resilience was observed more in preclinical doctors  88 9   Discussion  Resident doctors are a major force to combat COVID-19 as frontline health workers  hence  one can visualize burnout amongst them  On an individual basis  the work-related burnout was severely high in the clinical group owing to the workload which has been corresponding to a number of western studies  Nonclinical department doctors from pathology  community medicine  and microbiology did show burnout but showed a greater score in resilience  Psychological resilience has been identified as a component in preventing burnout  Conclusion  Therapy sessions can be used in clinical doctors facing burnout to build up their resilience,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908668
6117,Background  When vaccines became first available during the Covid-19 pandemic  their demand significantly exceeded their supply  In consequence  the access to vaccines  initially  was distributed unequally  At the same time  governments started easing pandemic restrictions for vaccinated and recovered persons and restoring their freedoms since their risk of transmitting the virus is significantly reduced  Evidence  We show that restoring freedoms for vaccinated and recovered persons - while upholding restrictions for the rest of the population - is morally unfair during vaccine scarcity  Further  it may yield unintended side-effects  including perverse incentives  growing rifts in society  and the expansion of marginalization  Policy Options   Recommendations  We recommend accompanying easing for vaccinated and recovered individuals by mitigation measures for those who are neither vaccinated nor recovered  We propose  first  to temporarily lift the same restrictions for negative-tested individuals  as for vaccinated or recovered people  Second  the state must ensure broad and easy access to testing for everyone - free of charge  Conclusion  If done right  these mitigation measures create  at least temporarily  equal access to freedom for everybody - solving the moral problem of unfair access to freedoms and counteracting possible negative consequences,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909235
6885,As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rise  the development of effective vaccines is of crucial importance to prevent further morbidity and mortality  In parallel  some rare adverse events related to COVID-19 vaccines  have been reported  most of them mild  Here we report the case of a previously healthy 19-year-old woman who developed optic neuritis 1 week after single dose of Ad26 COV2 S vaccine with marked improvement after management with steroids  Although causality cannot be confirmed due to lack of a biological marker  this case may help to guide further research for potential pathogenic mechanism,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900001
1352,Recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants Mu and C 1 2 have spike proteins with mutations that may confer resistance to natural and vaccine-elicited antibodies  Analysis of neutralizing antibody titers in the sera of vaccinated individuals without previous history of infection and from convalescent individuals show partial resistance of the viruses  In contrast  sera from individuals with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were subsequently vaccinated neutralize variants with titers 4- to 11-fold higher  providing a rationale for vaccination of individuals with previous infection  The heavily mutated C 1 2 spike is the most antibody neutralization-resistant spike to date  however  the avidity of C 1 2 spike protein for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is low  This finding suggests that the virus evolved to escape the humoral response but has a decrease in fitness  suggesting that it may cause milder disease or be less transmissible  It may be difficult for the spike protein to evolve to escape neutralizing antibodies while maintaining high affinity for ACE2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982967
9040,The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is threatening not only physical but also mental health  Although some recent quantitative studies have been conducted and revealed the influence of the pandemic on mental health and its relevant factors  it is impossible to obtain and explore all possible variables strongly related to mental health  Therefore  we attempted to adopt a bottom-up approach using text mining of participants  narratives  We examined how participants  descriptions of daily life during the pandemic were categorized into various topics  and which topics were related to their mental health in a sample of 776 Japanese citizens in the general population over 18 years old  Results of a topic modeling with 2 594 unique words provided nine topics  mask  physical symptoms  children  infection anxiety  disinfection items  economic influence  remote work  going out  and change of lifestyle   Those who wrote about economic influence  physical symptoms  and disinfection items experienced lower life satisfaction and higher depression and negative affect  whereas those who mentioned their children were likely to have higher life satisfaction  This study highlighted that monitoring the mental health of individuals with economic impacts and physical symptoms may reduce the damage of COVID-19  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s11469-021-00587-y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867123
4004,Importance  During the 2020-2021 academic year  many institutions of higher education reopened to residential students while pursuing strategies to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on campus  Reopening guidance emphasized polymerase chain reaction or antigen testing for residential students and social distancing measures to reduce the frequency of close interpersonal contact  and Connecticut colleges and universities used a variety of approaches to reopen campuses to residential students  Objective  To characterize institutional reopening strategies and COVID-19 outcomes in 18 residential college and university campuses across Connecticut  Design  Setting  and Participants  This retrospective cohort study used data on COVID-19 testing and cases and social contact from 18 college and university campuses in Connecticut that had residential students during the 2020-2021 academic year  Exposures  Tests for COVID-19 performed per week per residential student  Main Outcomes and Measures  Cases per week per residential student and mean  95  CI  social contact per week per residential student  Results  Between 235 and 4603 residential students attended the fall semester across each of 18 institutions of higher education in Connecticut  with fewer residential students at most institutions during the spring semester  In census block groups containing residence halls  the fall student move-in resulted in a 475   95  CI  373 -606   increase in mean contact  and the spring move-in resulted in a 561   95  CI  441 -713   increase in mean contact compared with the 7 weeks prior to move-in  The association between test frequency and case rate per residential student was complex  institutions that tested students infrequently detected few cases but failed to blunt transmission  whereas institutions that tested students more frequently detected more cases and prevented further spread  In fall 2020  each additional test per student per week was associated with a decrease of 0 0014 cases per student per week  95  CI  -0 0028 to -0 00001   Conclusions and Relevance  The findings of this cohort study suggest that  in the era of available vaccinations and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants  colleges and universities should continue to test residential students and use mitigation strategies to control on-campus COVID-19 cases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940864
4702,INTRODUCTION  The generalization of treatment with dexamethasone or other immunosuppressants in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of occurrence of severe forms of strongyloidiasis  A nationwide survey was conducted to better understand the diagnostic and therapeutic situation of strongyloidiasis in SARS-CoV-2 co-infected patients in Spain  MATERIALS AND METHODS  A survey was designed and sent to all SEIMC members during February and March 2021  Responses were exported for computer processing to Microsoft Excel 2017 and statistically processed with the free software PSPP  RESULTS  189 responses were received  of which 121  64   were selected for further processing  Eighty-four centers  69 5   had no specific strongyloidiasis screening protocol  Forty-two centers  34 7   had serological techniques available in their laboratories and the rest were sent to a reference laboratory  Only 22 centers  18   screened for strongyloidiasis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients  A total of 227 cases of strongyloidiasis were diagnosed in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  In four cases patients developed a massive hyperinfestation syndrome leading to the death of one patient  CONCLUSION  COVID-19 has highlighted the need to unify screening and treatment protocols for imported pathologies such as strongyloidiosis  Efforts to disseminate knowledge are needed to ensure that this potentially fatal disease is adequately treated in patients with the highest risk of complications  such as those with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931102
9829,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is spreading like wildfire with no specific recommended treatment in sight  While some risk factors such as the presence of comorbidities  old age  and ethnicity have been recognized  not a lot is known about who the virus will strike first or impact more  In this hopeless scenario  exploration of time-tested facts about viral infections  in general  seems to be a sound basis to prop further research upon  The fact that immunity and its various determinants  e g   micronutrients  sleep  and hygiene  have a crucial role to play in the defense against invading organisms  may be a good starting point for commencing research into these as yet undisclosed territories  Herein  the excellent immunomodulatory  antiviral  and anti-inflammatory roles of Vitamin D necessitate thorough investigation  particularly in COVID-19 perspective  This article reviews mechanisms and evidence suggesting the role Vitamin D plays in people infected by the newly identified COVID-19 virus  For this review  we searched the databases of Medline  PubMed  and Embase  We studied several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of Vitamin D in influenza and other contagious viral infections  We also reviewed the circumstantial and anecdotal evidence connecting Vitamin D with COVID-19 emerging recently  Consequently  it seems logical to conclude that the immune-enhancing  antiviral  anti-inflammatory  and lung-protective role of Vitamin D can be potentially lifesaving  Hence  Vitamin D deserves exhaustive exploration through rigorously designed and controlled scientific trials  Using Vitamin D as prophylaxis and or chemotherapeutic treatment of COVID-19 infection is an approach worth considering  In this regard  mass assessment and subsequent supplementation can be tried  especially considering the mechanistic evidence in respiratory infections  low potential for toxicity  and widespread prevalence of the deficiency of Vitamin D affecting many people worldwide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34854410
9706,This review summarizes high-quality evidence supporting delayed umbilical cord clamping to promote placental transfusion to preterm and term neonates  In preterm neonates  delayed cord clamping may decrease mortality and the need for blood transfusions  Although robust data are lacking to guide cord management strategies in many clinical scenarios  emerging literature is reviewed on numerous topics including delivery mode  twin gestations  maternal comorbidities  eg  gestational diabetes  red blood cell alloimmunization  human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  infection  and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  and neonatal complications  eg  fetal growth restriction  congenital heart disease  and the depressed neonate   Umbilical cord milking is an alternate method of rapid placental transfusion  but has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm neonates  Data on long-term outcomes are discussed  as well as potential contraindications to delayed cord clamping  Overall  delayed cord clamping offers potential benefits to the estimated 140 million neonates born globally every year  emphasizing the importance of this simple and no-cost strategy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856560

2029,INTRODUCTION  Ankle fractures have continued to occur through the COVID pandemic and  regardless of patient COVID status  often need operative intervention for optimizing long-term outcomes  For healthcare optimization  patient counseling  and care planning  understanding if COVID-positive patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery are at increased risk for perioperative adverse outcomes is of interest  METHODS  The COVID-19 Research Database contains recent United States aggregated insurance claims  Patients who underwent ankle fracture surgery from April 1st  2020 to June 15th  2020 were identified  COVID status was identified by ICD coding  Demographics  comorbidities  and postoperative complications were extracted based on administrative data  COVID-positive versus negative patients were compared with univariate analyses  Propensity-score matching was done on the basis of age  sex  and comorbidities  Multivariate regression was then performed to identify risk factors independently associated with the occurrence of 30-day postoperative adverse events  RESULTS  In total  9 835 patients undergoing ankle fracture surgery were identified  of which 57  0 58   were COVID-positive  COVID-positive ankle fracture patients demonstrated a higher prevalence of comorbidities  including  chronic kidney disease  diabetes  hypertension  and obesity  p<0 05 for each   After propensity matching and controlling for all preoperative variables  multivariate analysis found that COVID-positive patients were at increased risk of any adverse event  odds ratio  OR    3 89  p   0 002   a serious adverse event  OR   5 48  p   0 002   and a minor adverse event  OR   3 10  p   0 021   DISCUSSION  COVID-positive patients will continue to present with ankle fractures requiring operative intervention  Even after propensity matching and controlling for patient factors  COVID-positive patients were found to be at increased risk of 30-day perioperative adverse events  Not only do treatment teams need to be protected from the transmission of COVID in such situations  but the increased incidence of perioperative adverse events needs to be considered,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972190
7680,Background  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic remains a global healthcare crisis  Nevertheless  the majority of COVID-19 cases involve mild to moderate symptoms in the early stages  The lack of information relating to these cases necessitates further investigation  Methods  Patients visiting the outpatient clinic at the Kamagaya General Hospital were screened by interview and body temperature check  After initial screening  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection was suspected in 481 patients who then underwent blood tests and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification  LAMP  test for SARS-CoV-2  Clinical characteristics between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 groups were compared  Further  the novel predictive value of routine blood test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated using ROC analysis  Results  A total of 15 560 patients visited our hospital during the study period  After exclusion and initial screening by interview  481 patients underwent the LAMP test and routine blood tests  Of these patients  69  14 3   were positive for SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with COVID-19  positive group   and 412  85 7   were negative  negative group   The median period between the first onset of symptoms and visit to our hospital was 3 4 and 2 9 days in the negative and positive groups  respectively  Cough  p   0 014   rhinorrhea  p   0 039   and taste disorders  p < 0 001  were significantly more common in the positive group  while gastrointestinal symptoms in the negative group  p   0 043   The white blood cell count  p < 0 001   neutrophil count  p < 0 001   and percentage of neutrophils  p < 0 001  were higher in the negative group  The percentage of monocytes  p < 0 001  and the levels of ferritin  p < 0 001  were higher in the positive group  As per the predictive values for COVID-19 using blood tests  the values for the area under the curve for the neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio  NMR   white blood cell-to-hemoglobin ratio  WHR   and the product of the two  NMWH  were 0 857  0 837  and 0 887  respectively  Conclusion  Symptoms in early stage COVID-19 patients were similar to those in previous reports  Some blood test results were not consistent with previous reports  NMR  WHR  and NMWH are novel diagnostic scores in early-stage mild-symptom COVID-19 patients in primary care settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888326
3909,Return visits  RV  to a pediatric emergency department  PED  can be secondary to illness progression  parental concerns  call backs or rarely due to a diagnostic error during the first visit  Fever accounts for nearly half of these RVs and is also one of the most common presenting complaints of Corona Virus Disease 2019  COVID- 19  due to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection in children  Although majority of children with COVID 19 have a mild illness  severe complications such as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  MIS-C  can occur  These children are often critically ill with a mortality rate of 2-4   Initial symptoms of MIS- C are non- specific and mimic other viral illness making early diagnosis challenging  We report five patients who were evaluated for fever and discharged from our PED and were subsequently diagnosed with MIS-C  n   3  or Kawasaki Disease  n   2  during their RV within 7 days  All patients presented with fever during the initial visit and three of the five children had gastrointestinal symptoms  They were all noted have persistent tachycardia during the index visit  Three patients presented in cardiogenic shock and echocardiographic abnormalities were noted in four patients during the RV  Significant interventions were required in majority of these children  PICU admission  4  inotropes  3  mechanical ventilation 2   Clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion for diagnosis of MIS-C especially in those who present with persistent fever and have abnormal vital signs during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942428
5868,Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  different mitigation and management strategies limiting economic and social activities have been implemented across many countries  Despite these strategies  the virus continues to spread and mutate  As a result  vaccinations are now administered to suppress the pandemic  Current COVID-19 epidemic models need to be expanded to account for the change in behaviour of new strains  such as an increased virulence and higher transmission rate  Furthermore  models need to account for an increasingly vaccinated population  We present a network model of COVID-19 transmission accounting for different immunity and vaccination scenarios  We conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis and find the average immunity length after an infection to be one of the most critical parameters that define the spread of the disease  Furthermore  we simulate different vaccination strategies and show that vaccinating highly connected individuals first is the quickest strategy for controlling the disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912001
2932,BACKGROUND  Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia  VITT  is a rare  serious complication after adenoviral COVID-19 vaccine administration that can involve various organ systems  We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of hepatosplenic thrombosis in patients with VITT  METHODS  We searched PubMed ePubs  Scopus  Embase  and Web of Science databases for studies published until April 28  2021 involving patients with VITT after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination  Demographic and clinical characteristics including laboratory measurements were collected and compared  RESULTS  Four case series and three case reports involving 48 cases of VITT were included  Hepatosplenic thrombosis was present in eight cases  17    Patients with hepatosplenic thrombosis had lower platelet counts  13 000 vs  29 500 muL  p 0 016  and higher D-dimer levels  140 0 vs  57 3 times upper limit of normal range  p 0 028   Multiple-site thrombosis was also associated with hepatosplenic thrombosis  88  vs  15   p<0 001   CONCLUSIONS  This is the first study comparing clinical profiles of patients with VITT according to the presence of hepatosplenic thrombosis  Patients with hepatosplenic thrombosis had more severe presentations with lower platelet counts  higher D-dimer levels  and higher rate of multiple-site thromboses  Further studies with larger sample sizes are required to establish definitive evidence regarding the significance of hepatosplenic thrombosis in VITT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958931
9892,We have further extended our compartmental model describing the spread of the infection in Italy  As in our previous work  the model assumes that the time evolution of the observable quantities  number of people still positive to the infection  hospitalized and fatalities cases  healed people  and total number of people that has contracted the infection  depends on average parameters  namely people diffusion coefficient  infection cross-section  and population density  The model provides information on the tight relationship between the variation of the reported infection cases and a well-defined observable physical quantity  the average number of people that lie within the daily displacement area of any single person  With respect to our previous paper  we have extended the analyses to several regions in Italy  characterized by different levels of restrictions and we have correlated them to the diffusion coefficient  Furthermore  the model now includes self-consistent evaluation of the reproduction index  effect of immunization due to vaccination  and potential impact of virus variants on the dynamical evolution of the outbreak  The model fits the epidemic data in Italy  and allows us to strictly relate the time evolution of the number of hospitalized cases and fatalities to the change of people mobility  vaccination rate  and appearance of an initial concentration of people positives for new variants of the virus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34853368
6991,Introduction  Current healthcare settings and ICUs especially are complex  highly technical  and multidisciplinary  with interactions between healthcare professionals and users  in which there may be errors at different levels  Our objective was to assess the perception of patient safety in our unit at the end of the third wave of the COVID pandemic  with the intention of conducting subsequent improvement actions  Methods  Observational  cross-sectional  and descriptive study  The perception of Safety Culture was estimated using the HSOPS questionnaire translated into Spanish  Some questions were posed in a positive sense  and others in a negative sense  The response was also rated as positive  negative  or neutral  Our findings were compared visually  not mathematically  with those found in the previous national study <<Analysis of the culture on patient safety in the hospital setting of the Spanish National Health System>> published in 2009  A subgroup analysis was performed according to professional group and seniority as a health worker  The Student s t  chi    and ANOVA tests were used  Results  Sixty-two professionals responded to the questionnaire  73 90  of the total  The median time working in ICU 2 years  interquartile range 2-4 5 years   The rating for the degree of safety was 8 06  SD 1 16   The majority  91 20   had not reported any adverse event in the last year  A total of 30 90  had recently received patient safety training  The dimensions considered as weaknesses were 9  <<Staffing>>  with 27 57  of positive responses  and 10   Support of the hospital management in safety   with 17 64  of positive responses   The dimensions considered as strengths were 3  <<Expectation of actions by management   supervision of the service>>  with 85 29  of positive responses  and 5  <<Teamwork>>  with 95 58  of positive responses  The Cronbach s alpha index values suggest that the questionnaire has adequate internal consistency  In general  our data are more positive than those collected in the 2011 national survey  although the 2 dimensions considered weaknesses were already considered such in the previous work  Conclusions  The perception of patient safety in the ICU of our hospital after the end of the third wave of the COVID pandemic is adequate  with a more positive rating than that of the national study on safety culture at the hospital level carried out in 2009  The constant quest for patient safety should prioritize activity in the 2 dimensions considered weaknesses  staffing  and support from hospital management in everything related to patient safety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898979
5274,BACKGROUND  The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern  VOC  B 1 617 2  Delta  displaced B 1 1 7  Alpha  and is associated with increases in COVID-19 cases  greater transmissibility  and higher viral RNA loads but data is lacking regarding the infectious virus load and antiviral antibody levels in the nasal tract  METHODS  Whole genome sequencing  cycle threshold  Ct  values  infectious virus  anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels  and clinical chart reviews were combined to characterize SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the National Capital Region between January and September 2021 and differentiate infections in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals by the Delta  Alpha  and B 1 2 variants  RESULTS  The Delta variant displaced the Alpha variant to constitute 99  of the circulating lineages in the National Capital Region by August  2021  In Delta infections  28 5  were breakthrough cases in fully vaccinated individuals compared to 4  in the Alpha infected cohort  Breakthrough infections in both cohorts were associated with comorbidities  but only Delta infections were associated with a significant increase in the median days after vaccination   More than 74  of Delta samples had infectious virus compared to less than 30  from the Alpha cohort  The recovery of infectious virus with both variants was associated with low levels of local SARS-CoV-2 IgG  CONCLUSIONS  Infection with the Delta variant was associated with more frequent recovery of infectious virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals compared to the Alpha variant but was not associated with an increase in disease severity in fully vaccinated individuals  Infectious virus was correlated with the presence of low amounts of antiviral IgG in the nasal specimens,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922338
3063,Background  The Saudi government had implemented unprecedented preventive measures to deal with COVID-19  These measures included intermittent curfews  bans on public gatherings  limitations on many services  temporary suspension of Hajj  Umrah  and visit and launching awareness campaigns  Therefore  this study aimed to assess the KAP toward COVID-19 among residents of the border region of Jazan  Saudi Arabia  Methods  An online cross-sectional survey was distributed from May 4 to May 21  2020  using a Google Form  The survey questionnaire covered demographic characteristics and KAP toward COVID-19  The KAP questions consisted of 17 items on knowledge  four items on attitude  and six items on practice  Results  A total of 597 participants responded to the survey questionnaire  Overall  participants demonstrated a good knowledge of COVID-19  correctly answering 77  of the knowledge questions  Most of the participants exhibited good attitudes and acceptable practices toward COVID-19  Multiple regression analysis revealed that participants with a university education  B   1 75  or post-graduate education  B   2 24   those with an income >SR 10 000-20 000  B   1 38  or >SR 20 000  B   2 07   and those who had received a personal health education  B   1 19  had higher COVID-19 knowledge scores  p < 0 05   The ordinal logistic regression analysis found that compared to being female  being male was significantly associated with worrying about COVID-19  p   0 024  OR   1 78   willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine  p   0 003  OR   1 81   and willingness to report potential symptoms of COVID-19  p   0 046  OR   2 28   Worrying about COVID-19 was significantly associated with pre-university education vs  post-graduate education  p <   0 001  OR   7 94  and university education vs  post-graduate education  p <   0 001  OR   4 17   The binary logistic regression analysis found that compared to being female  being male was significantly associated with less face mask wearing in public  p   0 009  OR   0 31   Females were 3 23 times more likely to wear a face mask than were males  Conclusions  Most of the study participants had good knowledge  positive attitudes  and effective practices toward COVID-19  The findings of this study may help guide future awareness resources to the groups most in need in the Jazan region  particularly as the COVID-19 situation develops and changes  Further assessment should consider the groups omitted from this study  including immigrants and the elderly who have not adopted social media and technology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957005
5173,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has put community pharmacists at the frontline of prevention  preparedness  response  and recovery efforts  Pharmacies had to reorganize and implement several different interventions and measures within a very short time frame  OBJECTIVES  1  To map the current reported practice and trends and to review the literature on pharmacy-based interventions on COVID-19 provided in Europe  2  To identify knowledge gaps and future avenues for pharmacy research  policy  and practice in response to public health emergencies  METHODS  We used a mixed methods approach combining country mapping of current practices of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 reported by pharmacy associations in Europe with a scoping review of published literature  RESULTS  We mapped current practices on 31 pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 in 32 countries in Europe  Almost all preventive measures to reduce health risks have been provided in most countries  Other frequent interventions reflected preparedness for stockpiling  increased demand for services and products  and important patient care interventions exceeding dispensing role  Expanded powers granted to pharmacies and legislation passed in view of COVID-19 enabled services that improve access to medicines and relevant products  patient screening and referral including point-of-care antigen testing  support to vulnerable patients  and COVID-19 vaccination  We identified 9 studies conducted in pharmacies in 7 countries in Europe  Most studies are cross-sectional and or descriptive  Pharmacy associations played an important supporting role by developing and updating guidance and emergency plans to assist community pharmacists  CONCLUSIONS  A wide array of pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 was implemented in several countries within a very short time frame  Research on pharmacy interventions on COVID-19 is still in its infancy but confirmed the wide array of interventions provided and expanded powers granted to pharmacies  These findings may provide a significant impact to improve pharmacy research  policy  and practice in response to future public health emergencies in Europe and globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924315
5247,Managing pregnant individuals with acute respiratory disease secondary to Coronavirus disease 2019 has been a challenge  Most professional societies including the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine recommend keeping oxygen saturation greater than or equal to 95  in pregnant individuals  Reaching this target has been increasingly difficult in some patients  especially with the latest wave of the virus attributed to the delta variant  In the absence of strong data  and in the setting of reassuring fetal status  we propose maintaining maternal oxygen saturation between 92-96  for admitted patients with acute respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen  This may prevent unnecessary invasive interventions that might not be of maternal or fetal benefit  specifically at very preterm gestational ages,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922921
6828,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic presents a challenge to health care for patients with chronic diseases  especially hypertension  because of the important association and increased risk of these patients with a severe presentation of COVID-19 disease  The Guatemalan Ministry of Health has been implementing a multi-component program aimed at improving hypertension control in rural communities since 2019 as a part of an intervention research cluster randomized trial  When the first cases of COVID-19 were reported  March 13  2020  in Guatemala  our study paused all study field activities  and began monitoring participants through phone calls  The objective of this paper is to describe the approach used to monitor study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic and compare data obtained during phone calls for intervention and control group participants  Methods  We developed a cross-sectional study within the HyTREC  Hypertension Outcomes for T4 Research within Lower Middle-Income Countries  project  Multicomponent Intervention to Improve Hypertension Control in Central America  Guatemala  in which phone calls were made to participants from both intervention and control groups to monitor measures important to the study  delivery of antihypertensive medications in both groups  receipt of coaching sessions and use of a home blood pressure monitor by intervention group participants  as well as reasons that they were not implemented  Results  Regarding the delivery of antihypertensive drugs by the MoH to participants  those in the intervention group had a higher level of medication delivery  73   than the control group  51    p<0 001  Of the total participants in the intervention group  62  had received at least one health coaching session in the previous three months and 81  used a digital home blood pressure monitor at least twice a week  Intervention activities were lower than expected due to restricted public transportation on top of decreased availability of health providers  Conclusion  In Guatemala  specifically in rural settings  access to antihypertensive medications and health services during pandemic times was impaired and less than expected  even after accounting for the program s implementation activities and actions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900568
7436,Health disorders related to the prolonged exposure to stress are very common among office workers  The need for an automated and unobtrusive method of detecting and monitoring occupational stress is imperative and intensifies in the current conditions  where the pandemic COVID-19 causes changes in the working norms globally  In this study  we present a smart computer mouse with biometric sensors integrated in such a way that its structure and functionality remain unaffected  Photoplethysmography  PPG  signal is collected from user s thumb by a PPG sensor placed on the side wall of the mouse  while galvanic skin response  GSR  is measured from the palm through two electrodes placed on the top surface of the mouse  Biosignals are processed by a microcontroller and can be transferred wirelessly over Wi-Fi connection  Both the sensors and the microcontroller have been placed inside the mouse  enabling its plug and play use  without any additional equipment  The proposed module has been developed as part of a system that infers about the stress levels of office workers  based on their interactions with the computer and its peripheral devices,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892773
5746,The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the fore the urgent need for vaccine design and delivery platforms that can be rapidly deployed for manufacture and distribution  Though the mRNA and adenoviral vector platforms have been enormously successful to control SARS-CoV-2 viral infections  it is unclear if this could be replicated against more complex pathogens or the emerging variants  Recently  we described a  universal  platform that can incorporate multiple vaccine targets into the same nanoparticle scaffold by CRISPR engineering of bacteriophage T4  A T4-COVID vaccine designed with this technology elicited broad immunogenicity and complete protection against virus challenge in a mouse model  Here  we describe the detailed methodology to generate recombinant bacteriophage T4 backbones using CRISPR that can also be broadly applicable to other bacteriophages that abundantly pervade the Earth,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914049
9153,Infection of human cells by pathogens  including SARS-CoV-2  typically proceeds by cell surface binding to a crucial receptor  The primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   yet new studies reveal the importance of additional extracellular co-receptors that mediate binding and host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2  Vimentin is an intermediate filament protein that is increasingly recognized as being present on the extracellular surface of a subset of cell types  where it can bind to and facilitate pathogens  cellular uptake  Biophysical and cell infection studies are done to determine whether vimentin might bind SARS-CoV-2 and facilitate its uptake  Dynamic light scattering shows that vimentin binds to pseudovirus coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  and antibodies against vimentin block in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-expressing cells  The results are consistent with a model in which extracellular vimentin acts as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a binding affinity less than that of the spike protein with ACE2  Extracellular vimentin may thus serve as a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 complex in mediating SARS-CoV-2 cell entry  and vimentin-targeting agents may yield new therapeutic strategies for preventing and slowing SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866333

7113,Antiviral monoclonal antibody  mAb  discovery enables the development of antibody-based antiviral therapeutics  Traditional antiviral mAb discovery relies on affinity between antibody and a viral antigen to discover potent neutralizing antibodies  but these approaches are inefficient because many high affinity mAbs have no neutralizing activity  We sought to determine whether screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs at reduced pH could provide more efficient neutralizing antibody discovery  We mined the antibody response of a convalescent COVID-19 patient at both physiological pH  7 4  and reduced pH  4 5   revealing that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were preferentially enriched in pH 4 5 yeast display sorts  Structural analysis revealed that a potent new antibody called LP5 targets the SARS-CoV-2 N-terminal domain supersite via a unique binding recognition mode  Our data combine with evidence from prior studies to support antibody screening at pH 4 5 to accelerate antiviral neutralizing antibody discovery,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898670
4751,OBJECTIVES  During the COVID-19 pandemic  most countries implemented lockdowns that motivated changes in the dietary patterns  physical activity  and body mass index  BMI  of consumers worldwide  as well as the emergence of new food marketing strategies in social media  We sought to design and validate a methodology for monitoring and evaluating the Facebook marketing strategies of multinational fast-food chains in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  DATA DESCRIPTION  We developed three datasets  First  a dataset with the Uniform Resource Locators  URLs  of 1015 Facebook posts of five fast-food chains present in Argentina  Bolivia  Guatemala  and Peru  Second  a dataset of 106 content-analyzed posts we used in a pilot to determine intercoder reliability using statistical tests  Third  a dataset of a final sample of the 1015 content-analyzed posts that we used to determine the variables most frequently used  Following a mixed-methods approach  we developed 29 variables that recorded general information  as well as the marketing strategies we identified in the posts  including 14 COVID-19 specific variables  These data should help to monitor the social media marketing strategies that fast-food chains have introduced during the COVID-19 lockdowns  thus providing initial evidence about how they could be contributing to an unhealthy food environment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930460

8317,The Coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19  pandemic has profoundly affected economic and health systems around the world  This paper aims to assess household access to basic foods and health care and food security attainment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Burkina Faso  We use the COVID-19 High-Frequency Phone Survey 2020 panel data supported by the World Bank and conducted by Institut National de la Statistique et de la Demographie  INSD   The pooled multinomial logistic  the panel logistic  and the panel ordered logistic regressions are used to analyse the access to basic foods  the access to health care and the food security of the households  respectively  The results show that during COVID-19  female-headed households  poor households and farm households remain the most vulnerable in terms of access to basic foods  health services and food insecurity  Furthermore  the results indicate that households living outside the capital  particularly in the other urbans  experience fewer difficulties obtaining basic foods than those residing in the capital and are also unlikely to experience food insecurity  For more effective policy responses to the COVID-19 or similar shocks  the interventions should focus on household socioeconomic conditions and distinguish between urban and rural areas,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877532
1803,Buprenorphine Naloxone  Suboxone R   is an efficacious treatment for opioid use disorder  OUD  due to its more convenient dosing  superior safety profile  and decreased incidence of negative side effects when compared to other forms of medications for opioid use disorder  MOUD   In the United States  updated legislation in 2021 entitled   The Practice Guidelines for the Administration of Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder   released by the Department of Health and Human Services  creates an exemption for the previously required Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000  DATA  waiver for buprenorphine prescribing for clinicians  This legislation was born out of a need for making MOUD more accessible for patients living with OUD as rates of opioid-related deaths in the United States have continued to rise and have increased disproportionately during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic  This legislation has the potential to improve access to MOUD across all geographic locations  but may have the most profound impact in rural areas where significant disparities and challenges still exist in patients  ability to access buprenorphine  The purpose of this literature review is to 1  examine how MOUD prescribing has changed after previous legislation changes  2  explore the current state of buprenorphine access for treatment of OUD in rural America  3  detail existing barriers in patients  ability to access MOUD  and 4  discuss future directions and considerations as a result of new legislation  This literature review found several existing barriers to receiving MOUD such as increasing costs  insufficient education  significant stigma  and the need for more innovative methods of delivery  We also found that there is currently a large opportunity for growth in the number of rural clinicians able to prescribe buprenorphine  particularly in primary care  that may now occur as a result of this new legislation  Overall  this legislation has the potential to have a positive impact on combating OUD  especially in rural areas  and may be a critical step towards ending the current opioid epidemic in the United States as these described barriers are addressed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976492
1713,Introduction In response to the national coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  all hospitals and medical institutes gave priority to COVID-19 screening and to the management of patients who required hospitalization for COVID-19 infection  Surgical departments postponed all elective operative procedures and provided only essential surgical care to patients who presented with acute surgical conditions or suspected malignancy  Ample literature has emerged during this pandemic regarding the guidelines for safe surgical care  We report our experience during the lockdown period including the surgical procedures performed  the perioperative care provided  and the specific precautions implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis  Materials and Methods We extracted patient clinical data from the medical records of all surgical patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital between the March 24th  2020 and May 31st  2020  Data collected included  patient demographics  surgical diagnoses  surgical procedures  nonoperative management  and patient outcomes  Results Seventy-seven patients were included in this report  23 patients were managed medically  28 patients underwent a radiologic intervention  and 23 patients required an operative procedure  In total eight of the 77 patients died due to ongoing sepsis  multiorgan failure  or advanced malignancy  Conclusion During the COVID-19 lockdown period  our surgical team performed many lifesaving surgical procedures and appropriately selected cancer operations  We implemented and standardized essential perioperative measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection  When the lockdown measures were phased out a large number of patients remained in need of delayed elective and semi-elective operative treatment  Hospitals  medical institutes  and surgical leadership must adjust their priorities  foster stewardship of limited surgical care resources  and rapidly implement effective strategies to assure perioperative safety for both patients and operating room staff during periods of crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977359
455,BACKGROUND  during the COVID-19 pandemic a total lockdown was enforced all over Italy starting on March 9th  This resulted in the shrinking of economic activities  In addition  all formal occupational security-training courses were halted  among them the 81 08 law lectures and Basic Life Support-Defibrillation  BLS-D  laymen training courses  The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on BLS-D laymen training courses in the Lombardy region  METHODS  BLS-D training courses records for the Lombardy region were analysed  The analysis was conducted from 2016 to 2020 as part of the Hippo project  RESULTS  between 2017 and 2019 BLS-D trained laymen kept increasing  moving from 53 500 trained individuals up to 74 700  In 2020 a stark reduction was observed with only 22 160 individuals trained  Formal courses were not halted completely during 2020  Still  in the months available for training  the number of individuals enrolled showed a sharp 50  reduction  CONCLUSIONS  laymen training courses for emergency management are a fundamental component of primary prevention practice  The 81 08 and 158 12 Italian laws have decreed this practice mandatory on the workplace  Following the enforcement of the lockdown and the subsequent interruption of emergency management courses  efforts will be necessary to re-establish and guarantee the high quality training of the pre-pandemic period,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000651
210,Background  Latin America and the Caribbean  LAC  has presented some of the highest numbers of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the world  Even though indigenous communities represent 8  of the total population in this region  the impact of COVID-19 on this historically vulnerable population has only been briefly explored  Thus  this study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence and lethality attributable to SARS-CoV-2 in the indigenous population of LAC  Methods  A systematic review was conducted utilizing multiple databases  registry PROSPERO  CRD42020207862   Studies published in English  Spanish or Portuguese were selected between December 1st  2019  and April 14 th   2021  The evaluation of the quality of the study was carried out utilizing the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies  A qualitative synthesis of the data analyzed was conducted following the MOOSE and PRISMA declarations  Results  Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria  Eleven studies were carried out in a Brazilian population  three in a Mexican population  and one in a Colombian population  Four studies reported data about the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in indigenous populations of Brazil  range  4 2-81 65    Twelve studies reported lethality in indigenous people  eight in Brazil  three in Mexico  and one in Colombia   In Brazil  a lethality of 53 30  was described in a hospital setting and between 1 83  and 4 03  in community studies  In Mexico  the lethality of COVID-19 ranged between 16 5  and 19 9   Meanwhile  in Colombia  a lethality of 3 41  was reported  Most studies were deemed to be of good quality  Conclusions  Despite COVID-19 affecting indigenous populations of LAC  there is limited evidence of the seroprevalence and lethality of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in this population  Future investigations should ensure standardized methods that allow comparability among studies and ensure the precision of the results obtained,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003919
1512,Vaccines against COVID-19 are an essential global intervention to control the current pandemic situation  Anaphylactic reactions have rapidly been reported after SARS-CoV2 RNA vaccines  This risk is now measured at 2 5-11 1 000 000 in the context of vaccine safety surveillance programs and only one case was documented to be due to polyethylene glycol  Suggestions for its role are indirect  The COVID-19 vaccination is rolling out vastly and surveillance programs are key to monitor severe adverse reactions  such as anaphylaxis  It is important to restore confidence about vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA and other vaccines and current data confirm their safety with no greater mortality than previous vaccines  Anaphylaxis is a complication that should be recognized immediately  be treated with epinephrine and which is not limiting and allows re-vaccination of some patients with pre-medication  It is important to recognize populations at risk such as women  patients with a history of allergies and anaphylaxis and to recognize the rare patients who have mast cell activating diseases  Anaphylaxis due to vaccine is extremely rare and specific cases should receive individualized investigation and care  highlighting the key role of allergists in the vaccination programmes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34980951

6866,Background  Fast foods  though very popular  are commonly known as unhealthy foods  However  coronavirus pandemic may have influenced on food choices of the general population  This study investigated the changes in fast food consumption during epidemic lockdown 2020  Materials and Methods  This study was part of a nationwide survey having been conducted using a web-based electronic self-administered questionnaire  The questionnaire link was extensively distributed among the whole population both through popular social media platforms and by nutrition and health workers of health offices and medical universities of all provinces  The questionnaire included questions about socio-demographic characteristics  changes in frequency of fast food consumption as compared with before pandemic  and the reasons for these changes  Results  A total of 21 290 households took part in the study of whom 89 8  were male-headed  and almost 74  were from urban areas  Decrease in fast food consumption was reported by 74 8   while increase in fast food consumption was reported by 2  of the households during the COVID-19 quarantine  Among those who decreased their fast food consumption  about 82  had completely omitted them from their food baskets  Fear of contamination of fast foods by coronavirus and increase in the number of people at home were the most and the least frequent reasons for decreasing fast food consumption  respectively  Conclusion  Fast food consumption has dramatically decreased during the lockdown period in Iranian households  Though it may be considered a pleasant offshoot of disastrous COVID-19 epidemic  the foods replaced fast foods in Iranian households and the overall health consequences warrant further studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900241
9702,Background  The value of rapid reviews in informing health care decisions is more evident since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  While systematic reviews can be completed rapidly  rapid reviews are usually a type of evidence synthesis in which components of the systematic review process may be simplified or omitted to produce information more efficiently within constraints of time  expertise  funding or any combination thereof  There is an absence of high-quality evidence underpinning some decisions about how we plan  do and share rapid reviews  We will conduct a modified James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership to determine the top 10 unanswered research questions about how we plan  do and share rapid reviews in collaboration with patients  public  reviewers  researchers  clinicians  policymakers and funders  Methods  An international steering group consisting of key stakeholder perspectives  patients  the public  reviewers  researchers  clinicians  policymakers and funders  will facilitate broad reach  recruitment and participation across stakeholder groups  An initial online survey will identify stakeholders  perceptions of research uncertainties about how we plan  do and share rapid reviews  Responses will be categorised to generate a long list of questions  The list will be checked against systematic reviews published within the past three years to identify if the question is unanswered  A second online stakeholder survey will rank the long list in order of priority  Finally  a virtual consensus workshop of key stakeholders will agree on the top 10 unanswered questions  Discussion  Research prioritisation is an important means for minimising research waste and ensuring that research resources are targeted towards answering the most important questions  Identifying the top 10 rapid review methodology research priorities will help target research to improve how we plan  do and share rapid reviews and ultimately enhance the use of high-quality synthesised evidence to inform health care policy and practice,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34693206
8670,BACKGROUND  The highly transmissible Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2  B 1 617 2   first identified in India  is currently replacing pre-existing variants in many parts of the world  To help guide public health policies it is important to monitor efficiently its spread  Genome sequencing is the gold standard for identification of Delta  but is time-consuming  expensive  and unavailable in many regions  OBJECTIVE  To develop and evaluate a rapid  simple and inexpensive alternative to sequencing for Delta identification  METHODS  A double-mismatch allele-specific RT-PCR  DMAS-RT-PCR  was developed  The technique exploits allele-specific primers  targeting two spike gene mutations  L452R and T478K  within the same amplicon  The discriminatory power of each primer was enhanced by an additional mismatch located at the fourth nucleotide from the 3  end  Specificity was assessed by testing well characterised cell culture-derived viral isolates and clinical samples  most of which had previously been fully sequenced  RESULTS  In all cases the results of viral genotyping by DMAS-RT-PCR were entirely concordant with the results of sequencing  and the assay was shown to discriminate reliably between the Delta variant and other variants  Alpha and Beta   and  wild-type  SARS-CoV-2  Influenza A and RSV were non-reactive in the assay  The sensitivity of DMAS-RT-PCR matched that of the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR screening assay  Several samples that could not be sequenced due to insufficient virus were successfully genotyped by DMAS-RT-PCR  CONCLUSION  The method we describe would be simple to establish in any laboratory that can conduct PCR assays and should greatly facilitate monitoring of the spread of the Delta variant globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871906

4824,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic  Currently  as dangerous mutations emerge  there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients  The spike glycoprotein on the virus envelope binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  on host cells through its receptor binding domain  RBD  to mediate virus entry  Thus  blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and consequently stop infection  Here  we generated fusion proteins composed of the extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1  ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig  respectively   We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD  independently of its enzymatic activity  We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in-vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection better than ACE2-Ig  Mechanistically  we show that anti-spike antibody generation  ACE2 enzymatic activity  and ACE2 surface expression were not affected by RBD-Ig  Finally  we show that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at neutralizing high virus titers  We thus propose that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and that RBD-Ig should be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929007
1313,BACKGROUND  Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses in the U S  and are estimated to consume one-third of the country s mental health treatment cost  Although anxiolytic therapies are available  many patients still exhibit treatment resistance  relapse  or substantial side effects  Further  due to the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home order  social isolation  fear of the pandemic  and unprecedented times  the incidence of anxiety has dramatically increased  Previously  we have demonstrated dihydromyricetin  DHM   the major bioactive flavonoid extracted from Ampelopsis grossedentata  exhibits anxiolytic properties in a mouse model of social isolation-induced anxiety  Because GABAergic transmission modulates the immune system in addition to the inhibitory signal transmission  we investigated the effects of short-term social isolation on the neuroimmune system  METHODS  Eight-week-old male C57BL 6 mice were housed under absolute social isolation for 4 weeks  The anxiety-like behaviors after DHM treatment were examined using elevated plus-maze and open field behavioral tests  Gephyrin protein expression  microglial profile changes  NF-kappaB pathway activation  cytokine level  and serum corticosterone were measured  RESULTS  Socially isolated mice showed increased anxiety levels  reduced exploratory behaviors  and reduced gephyrin levels  Also  a dynamic alteration in hippocampal microglia were detected illustrated as a decline in microglia number and overactivation as determined by significant morphological changes including decreases in lacunarity  perimeter  and cell size and increase in cell density  Moreover  social isolation induced an increase in serum corticosterone level and activation in NF-kappaB pathway  Notably  DHM treatment counteracted these changes  CONCLUSION  The results suggest that social isolation contributes to neuroinflammation  while DHM has the ability to improve neuroinflammation induced by anxiety,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983568

2012,Implementing equity principles in resource allocation is challenging  In one approach  some US states implemented race-based prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccines in response to vast racial inequities in COVID-19 outcomes  while others used place-based allocation  In a nationally representative survey of n 2067 US residents  fielded in mid-April 2021  before the entire US population became eligible for vaccines   we explored the public acceptability of race-based prioritisation compared with place-based prioritisation  by offering vaccines to harder hit zip codes before residents of other zip codes  We found that in general  a majority of respondents supported the place-based approach  and a substantial proportion supported the race-based plan  Support was higher among Democrats compared with Republicans  All US residents became eligible for vaccines on 19 April 2021 but as of this writing  equitable uptake of vaccines remains urgent not only for first doses for adults but also for boosters and for children  Our findings also provide a benchmark for future pandemic planning that racial and social justice in vaccine allocation are salient considerations for the public  The findings may furthermore be of interest to policy makers designing vaccine allocation frameworks in countries with comparable health disparities across social  ethnic and racial groups  and more broadly  for those exploring ways of promoting equity in resource allocation outside of a pandemic setting,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972692

1775,Closed university buildings proved to be one of the main hot spots for virus transmission during pandemics  As shown during the COVID-19 pandemic  physical distancing is one of the most effective measures to limit such transmission  As universities prepare to manage in-class activities  students  adherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic  Unfortunately  while physical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed  the movement of students inside common spaces can pose high risk of close proximity  This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional student movement inside a case-study university building to investigate how physical distancing requirements impact student movement and grouping behaviour  Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical distancing guidance  but spaces such as corridors pose higher risk of exposure than doorways  Doorway width  in combination with group behaviour  affect the students  capacity to keep the recommended physical distance  Furthermore  questionnaire results show that students report higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors  Evidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding individuals  exposure to COVID-19 in universities and researchers in developing behavioural models in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976714
6340,OBJECTIVES  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused medical care delays and avoidance around the globe  However  little is known about the relationship between disrupted care and productivity loss attributed to presenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic  We aimed to investigate whether disrupted care during the COVID-19 state of emergency was associated with health status and productivity loss  METHODS  We used data from a nationwide  cross-sectional  Internet-based  self-administered survey  We performed multiple logistic regression analysis on data from 14 545 participants to investigate the associations among variables related to disrupted care  health status and the Work Functioning Impairment Scale  with a cut-off of 21 points  RESULTS  Participants who experienced exacerbation of underlying disease  adjusted OR  aOR  2 84  95  CI 2 28 to 3 53  or any type of disrupted care were more likely to show low productivity at work  Experiencing disruptions in routine and non-routine clinical settings  aOR 4 64  95  CI 3 64 to 5 92 and aOR 6 29  95  CI 4 74 to 8 34  respectively   and running out of drugs  aOR 6 13  95  CI 4 60 to 8 18  were strongly associated with exacerbation of underlying disease  CONCLUSIONS  Workers who experienced disrupted care were much more likely to show productivity loss  Exacerbation of underlying disease is one possible pathway through which disrupted care could affect productivity loss attributed to presenteeism  Our study provides evidence of the importance of early diagnosis and continuous treatment of non-COVID-19 patients to enable them to remain healthy and continue to work during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907047
6440,OBJECTIVE  The objective of this study was to analyse the temporal trend of HPV vaccination coverage  VC  in Spain in women aged 15-55 years not included in systematic vaccination programmes during the period 2007-2020  METHODS  We assessed the vaccine coverage rate in this population based on three estimations  1  annual vaccination coverage with at least one dose  VCR >   1d   2  annual VC for the full schedule  VCR3d   and 3  cumulative VC for the full schedule  aVCR   RESULTS  Annual VCR >   1d and VCR3d were highest in 2008  2 40  and 0 66  respectively  and subsequently decreased drastically in 2011  0 55  and 0 15    From 2017 to 2019 there was an increase from 1 4-fold to 1 6-fold  respectively  which decreased in 2020  In relation to aVCR  there was an increasing trend throughout the study period with approximately 4 03  of the study population having been vaccinated against HPV in 2020  CONCLUSION  In Spain  the cumulative vaccination coverage against HPV in women between 15-55 years old not included in current vaccination programmes remains very low  Nonetheless  the temporal trend has shown a slight increase in recent years  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020  no significant negative impact on vaccination coverage has been observed in this population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905216
7017,The ongoing global spread of COVID-19  SARS-CoV-2 2019 disease  is causing an unprecedented repercussion on human health and the economy  Despite the primary mode of transmission being through air droplets and contact  the transmission via wastewater is a critical concern  There is a lack of techniques able to provide complete disinfection  along with the uncertainty related to the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the natural environment and risks of contamination  This fact makes urgent the research towards new alternatives for virus removal from water and wastewater  Thus  this research aimed to characterize new lost-cost adsorbents for SARS-CoV-2 using Hymenachne grumosa as a precursor and verify its potential for removing SARS-CoV-2 from the solution  The aquatic macrophyte H  grumosa had in natura and activated carbon produced with H  grumosa and zinc chloride  ZnCl2 1 1  impregnation and carbonization  700 degrees C  1 h  were incubated for 24 h with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral suspension  and then the ribonucleic acid  RNA  was extracted and viral load quantified through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR  technique  The results demonstrated the great adsorption potential  achieving removal of 98 44  by H  grumosa  in natura   and 99 61  by H  grumosa with carbon activation  being similar to commercial activated carbon  99 67    Thus  this study highlights the possibility of low-cost biofilters to be used for SARS-CoV-2 removal  as an excellent alternative for wastewater treatment or watercourses decontamination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898862
5425,BACKGROUND  The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has affected health care systems globally  The aim of our study is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of hospital admissions for ischemic stroke by severity in Japan  METHODS  We analysed administrative  Diagnosis Procedure Combination-DPC  data for cases of inpatients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with ischemic stroke and admitted during the period April 1 2018 to June 27 2020  Levels of change of the weekly number of inpatient cases with ischemic stroke diagnosis after the declaration of state of emergency were assessed using interrupted time-series  ITS  analysis  The numbers of patients with various characteristics and treatment approaches were compared  We also performed an ITS analysis for each group   independent  or  dependent   divided based on components of activities of daily living  ADL  and level of consciousness at hospital admission  RESULTS  A total of 170 294 cases in 567 hospitals were included  The ITS analysis showed a significant decrease in the weekly number of ischemic stroke cases hospitalized  estimated decrease  -156 cases  95  confidence interval  CI   -209 to -104   which corresponds to -10 4   95  CI  -13 6 to -7 1   The proportion of decline in the independent group  -21 3   95  CI  -26 0 to -16 2  was larger than that in the dependent group  -8 6   95  CI  -11 7 to -5 4   CONCLUSIONS  Our results show a marked reduction in hospital admissions due to ischemic stroke after the declaration of the state of emergency for the COVID-19 pandemic  The independent cases were affected more in proportion than dependent cases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919571
3434,The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has exposed major gaps in our knowledge on the origin  ecology  evolution  and spread of animal coronaviruses  Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  PEDV  is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae that may have originated from bats and leads to significant hazards and widespread epidemics in the swine population  The role of local and global trade of live swine and swine-related products in disseminating PEDV remains unclear  especially in developing countries with complex swine production systems  Here we undertake an in-depth phylogeographic analysis of PEDV sequence data  including 247 newly sequenced samples  and employ an extension of this inference framework that enables formally testing the contribution of a range of predictor variables to the geographic spread of PEDV  Within China  the provinces of Guangdong and Henan were identified as primary hubs for the spread of PEDV  for which we estimate live swine trade to play a very important role  On a global scale  the United States and China maintain the highest number of PEDV lineages  We estimate that  after an initial introduction out of China  the United States acted as an important source of PEDV introductions into Japan  Korea  China and Mexico  Live swine trade also explains the dispersal of PEDV on a global scale  Given the increasingly global trade of live swine  our findings have important implications for designing prevention and containment measures to combat a wide range of livestock coronaviruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951645

495,Several existing drugs have gained initial consideration due to their therapeutic characteristics against COVID-19  Corona Virus Disease 2019   Hydroxychloroquine  HCQ  was proposed as possible therapy for shortening the duration of COVID-19  but soon after this  it was discarded  Similarly  known antiviral compounds were also proposed and investigated to treat COVID-19  We report a pharmacophore screening using essential chemical groups derived from HCQ and known antivirals to search a natural compound chemical space  Molecular docking of HCQ under physiological condition with spike protein  3C-like protease  3CLpro   and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp  of SARS-CoV2 showed - 8 52 kcal mole binding score with RdRp  while the other two proteins showed relatively weaker binding affinity  Docked complex of RdRp-HCQ is further examined using 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation  Docking and simulation study confirmed active chemical moieties of HCQ  treated as 6-point pharmacophore to screen ZINC natural compound database  Pharmacophore screening resulted in the identification of potent hit molecule   3S 3aR 6R 6aS -3- 5-phenylsulfanyltetrazol-1-yl -2 3 3a 5 6 6a-hexahydrofuro 3  2-b furan-6-yl N-naphthalen-ylcarbamate from natural compound library  Additionally  a set of antiviral compounds with similar chemical scaffolds are also used to design a separate ligand-based pharmacophore screening  Antiviral pharmacophore screening produced a potent hit 4-  1 5-dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenylpyrazol-4-yl - 2-hydroxyphenyl methyl -1 5-dimethy l-2-phenylpyrazol-3-one containing essential moieties that showed affinity towards RdRp  Further  both these screened compounds are docked  - 8 69 and - 8 86 kcal mol  and simulated with RdRp protein for 100 ns in explicit solvent medium  They bind at the active site of RdRp and form direct indirect interaction with ASP618  ASP760  and ASP761 catalytic residues of the protein  Successively  their molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area  MMPBSA  binding energies are calculated over the simulation trajectory to determine the dynamic atomistic interaction details  Overall  this study proposes two key natural chemical moieties   a  tetrazol and  b  phenylpyrazol that can be investigated as a potential chemical group to design inhibitors against SARS-CoV2 RdRp,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000060
9253,RATIONALE  The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide threat to public health and the global economy  The climate of fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic has fostered the emergence of a wide range of COVID-19 conspiracy theories that have the potential to shape public opinion and hinder the effective dissemination of valid information  Beliefs in conspiracy theories have been associated with maladaptive personality traits such as schizotypy and paranoia  as well as other non-psychotic psychological characteristics  e g   social isolation  stress   METHODS  An online survey was conducted to examine the associations between beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and psychotic-like experiences in a Portuguese community sample  N   438   while also addressing the role of sociodemographic variables  psychological outcomes  e g   stress  affective states   confinement-related factors  e g   confinement conditions behaviors   and pandemic-related factors  e g   health concerns  financial issues   RESULTS  Findings suggest that psychotic-like experiences are associated with beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories  particularly perceptual abnormalities and persecutory ideation  Moreover  increased health-related concerns and reduced education levels also seem to be liability factors for these conspiracy beliefs  CONCLUSION  These results add important insights into how the adherence to illogical and erroneous disease-related arguments can be related to psychotic-like experiences  COVID-19 conspiracy theories are yet another major challenge that governments and policymakers must contemplate when defining strategic directions to manage the current and future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864602
2968,BACKGROUND  The emergence of novel viruses poses severe challenges to global public health highlighting the crucial necessity for new antivirals  MAIN BODY  Monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  are immunoglobulins that bind with a single epitope  Mouse mAbs are generated by classic hybridoma technology and are mainly used for immunodiagnostics  For immunotherapy  it is critical to use monoclonal antibodies in the human form to minimize adverse reactions  They have been successfully used to treat numerous illnesses  accordingly  an increasing number of mAbs  with high potency against emerging viruses is the target of every biopharmaceutical company  The diagnostic and therapeutic mAbs market grows rapidly into a multi-billion-dollar business  Biopharmaceuticals are innovative resolutions which revolutionized the treatment of significant chronic diseases and malignancies  Currently  a variety of therapeutic options that include antiviral medications  monoclonal antibodies  and immunomodulatory agents are available in the management of COVID-19  SHORT CONCLUSION  The invasion of mAbs in new medical sectors will increase the market magnitude as it is expected to generate revenue of about 300 billion   by 2025  In the current mini-review  the applications of monoclonal antibodies in immune-diagnosis and immunotherapy will be demonstrated  particularly for COVID-19 infection and will focus mainly on monoclonal antibodies in the market,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958012
8776,Mobile measures of human circadian rhythms  CR  are needed in the age of chronotherapy  Two wearable measures of CR have recently been validated  one that uses heart rate to extract circadian rhythms that originate in the sinoatrial node of the heart  and another that uses activity to predict the laboratory gold standard and central circadian pacemaker marker  dim light melatonin onset  DLMO   We first find that the heart rate markers of normal real-world individuals align with laboratory DLMO measurements when we account for heart rate phase error  Next  we expand upon previous work that has examined sleep patterns or chronotypes during the COVID-19 lockdown by studying the effects of social distancing on circadian rhythms  In particular  using data collected from the Social Rhythms app  a mobile application where individuals upload their wearable data and receive reports on their circadian rhythms  we compared the two circadian phase estimates before and after social distancing  Interestingly  we found that the lockdown had different effects on the two ambulatory measurements  Before the lockdown  the two measures aligned  as predicted by laboratory data  After the lockdown  when circadian timekeeping signals were blunted  these measures diverged in 70  of subjects  with circadian rhythms in heart rate  or CRHR  becoming delayed   Thus  while either approach can measure circadian rhythms  both are needed to understand internal desynchrony  We also argue that interventions may be needed in future lockdowns to better align separate circadian rhythms in the body,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870267
4623,PURPOSE  The purpose of this study was to investigate the influencing factors for chest CT hysteresis and severity of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   METHODS  The chest CT data of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in 4 hospitals were retrospectively analyzed  An independent assessment was performed by one clinician using the DEXIN FACT Workstation Analysis System  and the assessment results were reviewed by another clinician  Furthermore  the mean hysteresis time was calculated according to the median time from progression to the most serious situation to improve chest CT in patients after fever relief  The optimal scaling regression analysis was performed by including variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis  In addition  a multivariate regression model was established to investigate the relationship of the percentage of lesion total lung volume with lymphocyte and other variables  RESULTS  In the included 166 patients with COVID-19  the average value of the most serious percentage of lesion total lung volume was 6 62  of which 90 patients with fever had an average hysteresis time of 4 5 days after symptom relief  with a similar trend observed in those without fever  Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphocyte count in peripheral blood and transcutaneous oxygen saturation decreased with the increase of the percentage of lesion total lung volume  CONCLUSION  There is a hysteresis effect in the improvement of chest CT image relative to fever relief in patients with COVID-19  The pulmonary lesions may be related to the severity as well as decreased lymphocyte count or percutaneous oxygen saturation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931984
7817,Bold new approaches are urgently needed to overcome global health challenges  The proposed Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health  ARPA-H  is intended to provide rapid health breakthroughs  While new technologies for earlier disease detection and more effective treatment are critical  we urge equal attention be given to the wider  physical  emotional  social  political  and economic  environmental ecosystems driving the non-communicable disease  NCD  crisis in the first place  This requires an integrated  cross-sectoral vision that spans the interwoven connections affecting health across the scales of people  places  and planet  This wider  exposome  perspective considers biopsychosocial factors that promote resilience and reduce vulnerabilities of individuals and communities over time-the many variables driving health disparities  Since life course health is strongly determined by early life environments  early interventions should be prioritized as a matter of effectiveness and social justice  Here  we explore the origins of the Advanced Research Project Agency and point to its potential to build integrated solutions  with wisdom and ethical value systems as a compass  Since the planned ARPA-H is anticipated to spawn international collaborations  the imagined concept is of relevance to a broad audience of researchers  With appropriate input  the quest for health equity through personalized  precision medicine while deconstructing unacceptable structural inequities may be accelerated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886514
27,Introduction  Many clinicians and patients tried telemedicine for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic  In a prior survey  we found that clinicians who were adaptable and willing to incorporate technology into their clinical practice are more likely to utilize telemedicine  Seeking factors associated with current and future use of telemedicine  and identifying its relative advantages and drawbacks  may help determine the role of telemedicine after the pandemic  Questions Purposes  We asked  1  which demographic factors and personal preferences are associated with current and planned future use of telemedicine   2  what factors are associated with telemedicine utilization  and  3  what are clinician-reported advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine  Materials and Methods  Approximately 750 clinicians within a national multispecialty hospital group were invited to complete an online survey assessing telemedicine use and preferences  self-reported technology proficiency  and personal characteristics  A total of 284 clinicians started the survey  and 259 complete responses were analyzed using bivariate analysis and multivariable regression  Results  More frequent current telemedicine use was associated with being a nonsurgeon clinician  not primarily practicing in an inpatient setting  preferring either telemedicine or having no preference for discussing sensitive topics  and greater self-reported technological proficiency  Planned future telemedicine use was associated with greater self-reported troubleshoot ability and less desire for a hands-on physical examination  Clinicians reported that the top benefits of telemedicine are decreased barriers for patients and convenience for clinicians  and disadvantages are technical difficulties for both patients and clinicians  Conclusions  Telemedicine continues to be widely utilized by clinicians  particularly those who are confident in their ability to examine patients over video  and who can troubleshoot issues that arise on the platform  With continued reimbursement  telemedicine is likely to remain a convenient and effective method of caring for patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007442
5035,Anxiety is highly reported during the COVID-19 pandemic  The use of acupressure for anxiety is a common practice in integrative medicine  and previous literature has shown that acupressure can be an effective and feasible alternative treatment for decreasing anxiety  Given the social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic  it appears reasonable to assume that acupressure may be especially suited to treat anxiety under these circumstances  However  there has been relatively little reported use of acupressure for anxiety during the pandemic  This viewpoint aims to highlight the possible role of acupressure as a self-administered therapeutic approach for anxiety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and to outline key areas for future research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925968

228,Background  The COVID-19 pandemic prompted movement restrictions in countries worldwide  impacting on physical activity  PA   a major non-communicable disease risk factor  and thus may have unintentional long-term health implications  In semi-rural areas of low-middle-income-countries  LMICs   where occupational activity is the main source of PA  changes in PA associated with COVID-19 restrictions are unknown  We investigated the impact of Movement Control Order  MCO  restrictions in a semi-rural region of Malaysia  Methods  The South East Asia Community Observatory  SEACO  is a dynamic prospective community cohort  We contacted a random sample of 1007 adults  18   who had previously provided PA data in 2018  We asked about PA during the MCO  March-May 2020  and at the time of interview  June 2020   Results  During the MCO  PA reduced by a mean of 6 7 hours week  95  confidence interval  CI    5 3  8 0  compared to 2018  with the largest reductions among those in employment  By June  PA was 3 4 hours week  95  CI   2 0  4 8  less than 2018  leaving 34  of adults currently inactive  20  in 2018   Reductions in occupational PA were not replaced with active travel or activity at home  Despite these observed reductions  most participants did not think the MCO had affected their PA  Conclusions  Movement restrictions are associated with lower PA lasting beyond the period of strict restrictions  such longer-term reductions in PA may have a detrimental impact on health  Future MCOs should encourage people to be active  but may additionally need targeted messaging for those who don t necessarily realise they are at risk  In particular  policies developed in more affluent countries may not easily translate to LMICs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003716
7608,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has had profound effects on society and  in particular  on many aspects of medical care  Residency training programs are often integral parts of our medical community and consequently have experienced changes in structure  format  and content  The conversion to virtual or online learning has been nearly universal  Decreases in common pediatric diagnoses such as respiratory syncytial virus and asthma have led to less first-hand experience for residents  Limitations designed to minimize the spread of COVID-19  such as use of personal protective equipment and group size limits  have led to fewer clinic rotations  fewer clinic sessions  and fewer patient experiences  Infections of residents themselves have led to an increase in back-up call system usage and a strain on staffing  Mandatory limits on group gatherings have also impaired camaraderie and the overall well-being of trainees   Pediatr Ann  2021 50 12  e509-e514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889133

4598,BACKGROUND  Patient portals are a safe and secure way for patients to connect with providers for video-based telepsychiatry and help to overcome the financial and logistical barriers associated with face-to-face mental health care  Due to the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  telepsychiatry has become increasingly important to obtaining mental health care  However  financial  and technological barriers  termed the  digital divide   prevent some patients from accessing the technology needed to utilize telepsychiatry services  OBJECTIVE  As an extension to a clinic s outreach project during COVID-19 to improve patient engagement with video-based visits through the hospital s patient portal among adult behavioral health patients at an urban safety net hospital  we aimed to assess patient preference for patient portal-based video visits or telephone-only visits  and to identify the demographic variables associated with their preference  METHODS  Patients in an outpatient psychiatry clinic were contacted by phone and preference for telepsychiatry by phone or video through a patient portal  as well as device preference for video-based visits  were documented  Patient demographic characteristics were collected from the electronic medical record  RESULTS  One hundred and twenty-eight patients were reached by phone  Seventy-nine patients  61 7   chose video-based visits and 69 6  of these patients preferred to access the patient portal through a smartphone  Older patients were significantly less likely to agree to video-based visits  CONCLUSIONS  Among behavioral health patients at a safety-net hospital  there was a relatively low engagement with video-based visits through the hospital s patient portal  particularly among older adults,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932497
4767,BACKGROUND  Effective syndromic surveillance alongside COVID-19 testing behaviours in the population including in higher risk and hard to reach subgroups is vital to detect re-emergence of COVID-19 transmission in the community  The aim of this paper was to identify the prevalence of acute respiratory infection symptoms and coronavirus testing behaviour among South Australians using data from a population based survey  METHODS  We used cross-sectional data from the 2020 state-wide population level health survey on 6857 respondents aged 18 years and above  Descriptive statistics were used to explore the risk factors and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the factors associated with the acute respiratory infection symptoms and coronavirus testing behaviour after adjusting for gender  age  household size  household income  Aboriginal and or Torres Strait Islander status  SEIFA  Country of birth  number of chronic diseases  wellbeing  psychological distress  and mental health  RESULTS  We found that 19 3  of respondents reported having symptoms of acute respiratory infection and the most commonly reported symptoms were a runny nose  11 2    coughing  9 9   and sore throat  6 2    Fever and cough were reported by 0 8  of participants  Of the symptomatic respondents  32 6  reported seeking health advice from a nurse  doctor or healthcare provider  Around 18   n   130  of symptomatic respondents had sought testing and a further 4 3   n   31  reported they intended to get tested  The regression results suggest that older age  larger household size  a higher number of chronic disease  mental health condition  poor wellbeing  and psychological distress were associated with higher odds of ARI symptoms  Higher household income was associated with lower odds of being tested or intending to be tested for coronavirus after adjusting for other explanatory variables  CONCLUSIONS  There were relatively high rates of self-reported acute respiratory infection during a period of very low COVID-19 prevalence and low rate of coronavirus testing among symptomatic respondents  Ongoing monitoring of testing uptake  including in higher-risk groups  and possible interventions to improve testing uptake is key to early detection of disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930193
372,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a new respiratory illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and now spreads globally  Currently  therapeutics and effective treatment options remain scarce and there is no proven drug to treat COVID-19  Targeting the positive-sense RNA genome and viral mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 to simultaneously degrade viral genome templates for replication and viral mRNAs for essential gene expression would be a strategy to completely realize virus elimination  Type VI CRISPR enzymes Cas13 have recently been identified as programmable RNA-guided  RNA-targeting Cas proteins with nuclease activity that allows for RNA cleavage and degradation  The precise viral RNA detection and antiviral application of the CRISPR Cas13 system depend on high-efficient and minimal off-target crRNAs  Although a computer-based algorithm has been applied for the design of crRNAs targeting SRAS-CoV-2  the experimental screening system to identify optimal crRNA is not available  We develop a one-step experimental screening system to identify high-efficient crRNAs with minimal off-target effects for CRISPR Cas13-based SARS-CoV-2 elimination  This platform provides the foundation for CRISPR Cas13-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19  This platform is versatile and could also be applied for crRNAs screening for other RNA viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002020

4174,The design of effective target-specific drugs for COVID-19 treatment has become an intriguing challenge for modern science  The SARS-CoV-2 main protease  M pro   responsible for the processing of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins and production of individual components of viral replication machinery  is an attractive candidate target for drug discovery  Specific M pro  inhibitors have turned out to be promising anticoronaviral agents  Thus  an effective platform for quantitative screening of M pro -targeting molecules is urgently needed  Here  we propose a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of the interaction of M pro  with inhibitors as a basis for such a platform  We examined the kinetic mechanism of peptide substrate binding and cleavage by wild-type M pro  and by its catalytically inactive mutant C145A  The enzyme induces conformational changes of the peptide during the reaction  The inhibition of M pro  by boceprevir  telaprevir  GC-376  PF-00835231  or thimerosal was investigated  Detailed pre-steady-state kinetics of the interaction of the wild-type enzyme with the most potent inhibitor  PF-00835231  revealed a two-step binding mechanism  followed by covalent complex formation  The C145A M pro  mutant interacts with PF-00835231 approximately 100-fold less effectively  Nevertheless  the binding constant of PF-00835231 toward C145A M pro  is still good enough to inhibit the enzyme  Therefore  our results suggest that even noncovalent inhibitor binding due to a fine conformational fit into the active site is sufficient for efficient inhibition  A structure-based virtual screening and a subsequent detailed assessment of inhibition efficacy allowed us to select two compounds as promising noncovalent inhibitor leads of SARS-CoV-2 M pro,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938188

8001,PURPOSE  The aim of this study was to evaluate radiology imaging volumes at distinct time periods throughout the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic as a function of regional COVID-19 hospitalizations  METHODS  Radiology imaging volumes and statewide COVID-19 hospitalizations were collected  and four 28-day time periods throughout the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 were analyzed  pre-COVID-19 in January  the  first wave  of COVID-19 hospitalizations in April  the  recovery  time period in the summer of 2020 with a relative nadir of COVID-19 hospitalizations  and the  third wave  of COVID-19 hospitalizations in November  Imaging studies were categorized as inpatient  outpatient  or emergency department on the basis of patient location at the time of acquisition  A Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare daily imaging volumes during each discrete 28-day time period  RESULTS  Imaging volumes overall during the first wave of COVID-19 infections were 55   11 098 20 011  P <  001  of pre-COVID-19 imaging volumes  Overall imaging volumes returned during the recovery time period to 99   19 915 20 011  P    725   and third-wave imaging volumes compared with the pre-COVID-19 period were significantly lower in the emergency department at 88 8   7 951 8 955  P <  001   significantly higher for outpatients at 115 7   8 818 7 621  P    008   not significantly different for inpatients at 106   3 650 3 435  P    053   and overall unchanged when aggregated together at 102   20 419 20 011  P    629   CONCLUSIONS  Medical imaging rebounded after the first wave of COVID-19 hospitalizations  with relative stability of utilization over the ensuing phases of the pandemic  As widespread COVID-19 vaccination continues to occur  future surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations will likely have a negligible impact on imaging utilization,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883068
9606,The accepted paradigm of foreign animal disease preparedness in Canada  the emergency for which to prepare  starts with identification of the exotic viral agent in a Canadian farm animal population  This narrative focuses on the containment of the infectious agent  within diseased animals  on infected premises  Framing the emergency as a disease incursion limits rational imagination to only one version of one potential animal emergency  This framing of the problem directs the carcass disposal solutions to consider only methods to dispose of viral infected material  However  in all documented responses to catastrophic swine diseases in the past three decades  the number of uninfected animals caught up in movement control zones and killed greatly exceeds the number of infected animals killed  The temporary closures of slaughterhouses in spring 2020 due to COVID-19 transmission resulted in thousands of healthy market hogs surplus to market  an unanticipated emergency of healthy pigs  This paper proposes an alternate carcass disposal option for material from uninfected farms   Excarnation by exposure  is a natural process of debulking and dehydrating carcasses by blow fly larvae  mitigating financial costs of final disposal  Excarnation by exposure is a reasonable and possibly necessary additional option for the management of uninfected carcasses in a catastrophic emergency response in commercial pigs,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857967
4695,The structural consequences of ongoing mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein remains to be fully elucidated  These mutations could change the binding affinity between the virus and its target cell  Moreover  obtaining new mutations would also change the therapeutic efficacy of the designed drug candidates  To evaluate these consequences  3D structure of a mutant spike protein was predicted and checked for stability  cavity sites  and residue depth  The docking analyses were performed between the 3D model of the mutated spike protein and the ACE2 protein and an engineered therapeutic ACE2 against COVID-19  The obtained results revealed that the N501Y substitution has altered the interaction orientation  augmented the number of interface bonds  and increased the affinity against the ACE2  On the other hand  the P681H mutation contributed to the increased cavity size and relatively higher residue depth  The binding affinity between the engineered therapeutic ACE2 and the mutant spike was significantly higher with a distinguished binding orientation  It could be concluded that the mutant spike protein increased the affinity  preserved the location  changed the orientation  and altered the interface amino acids of its interaction with both the ACE2 and its therapeutic engineered version  The obtained results corroborate the more aggressive nature of mutated SARS-CoV-2 due to their higher binding affinity  Moreover  designed ACe2-baased therapeutics would be still highly effective against covid-19  which could be the result of conserved nature of cellular ACE2  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s10989-021-10346-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931119

4825,BACKGROUND  Complement activation contributes to lung dysfunction in coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   We assessed whether C5 blockade with eculizumab could improve disease outcome  METHODS  In this single-centre  academic  unblinded study two 900 mg eculizumab doses were added-on standard therapy in ten COVID-19 patients admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 and receiving Continuous-Positive-Airway-Pressure  CPAP  ventilator support from <  24 hours  We compared their outcomes with those of 65 contemporary similar controls  Primary outcome was respiratory rate at one week of ventilator support  Secondary outcomes included the combined endpoint of mortality and discharge with chronic complications  RESULTS  Baseline characteristics of eculizumab-treated patients and controls were similar  At baseline  sC5b-9 levels  ex vivo C5b-9 and thrombi deposition were increased  Ex vivo tests normalised in eculizumab-treated patients  but not in controls  In eculizumab-treated patients respiratory rate decreased from 26 8  -7 3 breaths min at baseline to 20 3  -3 8 and 18 0  -4 8 breaths min at one and two weeks  respectively  p<0 05 for both   but did not change in controls  Between-group changes differed significantly at both time-points  p<0 01   Changes in respiratory rate correlated with concomitant changes in ex vivo C5b-9 deposits at one  rs   0 706  p   0 010  and two  rs   0 751  p   0 032  weeks  Over a median  IQR  period of 47 0  14 0-121 0  days  four eculizumab-treated patients died or had chronic complications versus 52 controls  HRCrude  95  CI   0 26  0 09-0 72   p   0 010   Between-group difference was significant even after adjustment for age  sex and baseline serum creatinine  HRAdjusted  95  CI   0 30  0 10-0 84   p   0 023   Six patients and 13 controls were discharged without complications  HRCrude  95  CI   2 88  1 08-7 70   p   0 035   Eculizumab was tolerated well  The main study limitations were the relatively small sample size and the non-randomised design  CONCLUSIONS  In patients with severe COVID-19  eculizumab safely improved respiratory dysfunction and decreased the combined endpoint of mortality and discharge with chronic complications  Findings need confirmation in randomised controlled trials,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928990
1339,The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increased burden on all medical services and healthcare professionals are applying new strategies to cope with the added demands  During the pandemic mental healthcare services in many parts of the world have been reorganised to incorporate modern technology and maintain efficient service delivery  Mental health professionals are playing a major role in alleviating the suffering resulting from this pandemic  A selective survey of the literature  including narrative reviews  was carried out to study the implications of digital psychiatry  Historically  epidemics have had a substantial effect on mental health and general health services  Telehealth appears to be the right solution to the present mental health crisis  but technology cannot substitute for human presence and proximity in mental health services  so the newer interventions have advantages and disadvantages  Remote methods of therapy are likely to continue to be used and proper assessment of these new ways of working in psychiatry is required  In the post-pandemic period  the challenge will be to combine digital and in-person therapies  Discussions about digital revolution in the field of psychiatry should be modified to digital evolution,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983228
8036,The outbreak of COVID-19 threatens the lives and property safety of countless people and brings a tremendous pressure to health care systems worldwide  The principal challenge in the fight against this disease is the lack of efficient detection methods  AI-assisted diagnosis based on deep learning can detect COVID-19 cases for chest X-ray images automatically  and also improve the accuracy and efficiency of doctors  diagnosis  However  large scale annotation of chest X-ray images is difficult because of limited resources and heavy burden on the medical system  To meet the challenge  we propose a capsule network model with multi-head attention routing algorithm  called MHA-CoroCapsule  to provide fast and accurate diagnostics for COVID-19 diseases from chest X-ray images  The MHA-CoroCapsule consists of convolutional layers  two capsule layers  and a non-iterative  parameterized multi-head attention routing algorithm is used to quantify the relationship between the two capsule layers  The experiments are performed on a combined dataset constituted by two publicly available datasets including normal  non-COVID pneumonia and COVID-19 images  The model achieves the accuracy of 97 28   recall of 97 36   and precision of 97 38  even with a limited number of samples  The experimental results demonstrate that  contrary to the transfer learning and deep feature extraction approaches  the proposed MHA-CoroCapsule has an encouraging performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not require pretraining and plenty of training samples,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882550
5758,Importance  Respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  is a leading cause of hospitalizations in young children  RSV largely disappeared in 2020 owing to precautions taken because of the COVID-19 pandemic  Estimating the timing and intensity of the reemergence of RSV and the age groups affected is crucial for planning for the administration of prophylactic antibodies and anticipating hospital capacity  Objective  To examine the association of different factors  including mitigation strategies  duration of maternal-derived immunity  and importation of external infections  with the dynamics of reemergent RSV epidemics  Design  Setting  and Participants  This simulation modeling study used mathematical models to reproduce the annual epidemics of RSV before the COVID-19 pandemic in New York and California  These models were modified to project the trajectory of RSV epidemics from 2020 to 2025 under different scenarios with varying stringency of mitigation measures for SARS-CoV-2  Simulations also evaluated factors likely to affect the reemergence of RSV epidemics  including introduction of the virus from out-of-state sources and decreased transplacentally acquired immunity in infants  Models using parameters fitted to similar inpatient data sets from Colorado and Florida were used to illustrate these associations in populations with biennial RSV epidemics and year-round RSV circulation  respectively  Statistical analysis was performed from February to October 2021  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome of this study was defined as the estimated number of RSV hospitalizations each month in the entire population  Secondary outcomes included the age distribution of hospitalizations among children less than 5 years of age  incidence of any RSV infection  and incidence of RSV lower respiratory tract infection  Results  Among a simulated population of 19 45 million people  virus introduction from external sources was associated with the emergence of the spring and summer epidemic in 2021  There was a tradeoff between the intensity of the spring and summer epidemic in 2021 and the intensity of the epidemic in the subsequent winter  Among children 1 year of age  the estimated incidence of RSV hospitalizations was 707 per 100000 children per year in the 2021 and 2022 RSV season  compared with 355 per 100000 children per year in a typical RSV season  Conclusions and Relevance  This simulation modeling study found that virus introduction from external sources was associated with the spring and summer epidemics in 2021  These findings suggest that pediatric departments should be alert to large RSV outbreaks in the coming seasons  the intensity of which could depend on the size of the spring and summer epidemic in that location  Enhanced surveillance is recommended for both prophylaxis administration and hospital capacity management,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913973

9403,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic continues to escalate intensively worldwide  Massive studies on general populations with SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed that pre-existing comorbidities were a major risk factor for the poor prognosis of COVID-19  Notably  49-75  of COVID-19 patients had no comorbidities  but this cohort would also progress to severe COVID-19 or even death  However  risk factors contributing to disease progression and death in patients without chronic comorbidities are largely unknown  thus  specific clinical interventions for those patients are challenging  METHODS  A multicenter  retrospective study based on 4806 COVID-19 patients without chronic comorbidities was performed to identify potential risk factors contributing to COVID-19 progression and death using LASSO and a stepwise logistic regression model  RESULTS  Among 4806 patients without pre-existing comorbidities  the proportions with severe progression and mortality were 34 29  and 2 10   respectively  The median age was 47 00 years  interquartile range  36 00-56 00   and 2162  44 99   were men  Among 51 clinical parameters on admission  age >   47  oxygen saturation < 95   increased lactate dehydrogenase  neutrophil count  direct bilirubin  creatine phosphokinase  blood urea nitrogen levels  dyspnea  increased blood glucose and prothrombin time levels were associated with COVID-19 mortality in the entire cohort  Of the 3647 patients diagnosed with non-severe COVID-19 on admission  489 13 41   progressed to severe disease  The risk factors associated with COVID-19 progression from non-severe to severe illness were increased procalcitonin levels  SpO2 < 95   age >   47  increased LDH  activated partial thromboplastin time levels  decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels  dyspnea and increased D-dimer levels  CONCLUSIONS  COVID-19 patients without pre-existing chronic comorbidities have specific traits and disease patterns  COVID-19 accompanied by severe bacterial infections  as indicated by increased procalcitonin levels  was highly associated with disease progression from non-severe to severe  Aging  impaired respiratory function  coagulation dysfunction  tissue injury  and lipid metabolism dysregulation were also associated with disease progression  Once factors for multi-organ damage were elevated and glucose increased at admission  these findings indicated a higher risk for mortality  This study provides information that helps to predict COVID-19 prognosis specifically in patients without chronic comorbidities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861603
3773,A two-stage isothermal amplification method  which consists of a first-stage basic recombinase polymerase amplification  RPA  and a second-stage fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification  LAMP   as well as a microfluidic-chip-based portable system  were developed in this study  these enabled parallel detection of multiplex targets in real time in around one hour  with high sensitivity and specificity  without cross-contamination  The consumption of the sample and the reagent was 2 1 muL and 10 6 muL per reaction for RPA and LAMP  respectively  The lowest detection limit  LOD  was about 10 copies  The clinical amplification of about 40 nasopharyngeal swab samples  containing 17 SARS-CoV-2  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  and 23 measles viruses  MV   were parallel tested by using the microfluidic chip  Both clinical specificity and sensitivity were 100  for MV  and the clinical specificity and sensitivity were 94 12  and 95 83  for SARS-CoV-2  respectively  This two-stage isothermal amplification method based on the microfluidic chip format offers a convenient  clinically parallel molecular diagnostic method  which can identify different nucleic acid samples simultaneously and in a timely manner  and with a low cost of the reaction reagent  It is especially suitable for resource-limited areas and point-of-care testing  POCT,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945432
5936,The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of infection tracking  The role of asymptomatic  undiagnosed individuals in driving infections within this pandemic has become increasingly evident  Modern phylogenetic tools that take into account asymptomatic or undiagnosed individuals can help guide public health responses  We finetuned established phylogenetic pipelines using published SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to examine reasonable estimate transmission networks with the inference of unsampled infection sources  The system utilised Bayesian phylogenetics and TransPhylo to capture the evolutionary and infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2  Our analyses gave insight into the transmissions within a population including unsampled sources of infection and the results aligned with epidemiological observations  We were able to observe the effects of preventive measures in Canada s  Atlantic bubble  and in populations such as New York State  The tools also inferred the cross-species disease transmission of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York City s Bronx Zoo  These phylogenetic tools offer a powerful approach in response to both the COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease outbreaks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34910769
592,BACKGROUND  The necessity to identify and isolate COVID-19 patients to avoid intrahospital cross infections is particularly felt as a challenge  Clinically occult SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients admitted to the hospital is always considered a risk during the pandemic  The aim of our study is to describe the application of CT scan to reveal unexpected COVID-19 in patients needing hospital admission  METHOD  In our emergency department  we prospectively enrolled adult patients needing hospital admission  without symptoms suspected of COVID-19  and showing negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  swab test  CT scan was performed to diagnose clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia  All the exams were read and discussed retrospectively by two expert radiologists and assigned to one of 4 exclusive diagnoses  typical  typCT   indeterminate  indCT   atypical  atyCT   negative  negCT   The clinical characteristics and final diagnoses were described and compared with the results of CT scans  RESULTS  From May 25 to August 18  2020  we prospectively enrolled 197 patients  They showed 122 negCT  52 atyCT  22 indCT  and 1 typCT  Based on the CT imaging  the prevalence of suspected clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia was 11 6   23 patients   None had confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the hospital stay  Nineteen patients had negative serial RT-PCR while in 4 cases  the infection was excluded by clinical follow-up or appearance of positivity of RT-PCR after months  CONCLUSION  Our descriptive analysis confirms that CT scan cannot be considered a valid tool to screen clinically occult COVID-19  when the asymptomatic patients need hospitalization for other conditions  Application of personnel protections and distancing among patients remains the best strategies to limit the possibility of intrahospital cross-infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997894
6699,Phaeohyphomycosis  previously known as chromoblastomycosis  is a chronic mycosis  usually affecting the skin  It is caused by dematiaceous fungi  which are a group of fungi that produce melanin in their cell walls  Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis occurs as a part of invasive presentation of the fungi  which usually affects immunocompromised patients  but may affect immunocompetent individuals as well  Cerebral infection in phaeohyphomycosis is associated with a poor prognosis regardless of the immune status of the patient  COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection and or medications used for its treatment may compromise the immune system  including in the post-COVID-19 period  resulting in invasive fungal infections  which have frequently been reported recently during the COVID-19 pandemic  We report a case of Fonsecaea associated cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a recently diagnosed diabetic Omani lady  who presented to our hospital 6 weeks after recovery and discharge from hospitalization for moderate COVID-19 pneumonia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901831
1482,Previous reports show that Ly49     CD8     T cells can suppress autoimmunity in mouse models of autoimmune diseases  Here we find a markedly increased frequency of CD8     T cells expressing inhibitory Killer cell Immunoglobulin like Receptors  KIR   the human equivalent of the Ly49 family  in the blood and inflamed tissues of various autoimmune diseases  Moreover  KIR     CD8     T cells can efficiently eliminate pathogenic gliadin-specific CD4     T cells from Celiac disease  CeD  patients  leukocytes in vitro   Furthermore  we observe elevated levels of KIR     CD8     T cells  but not CD4     regulatory T cells  in COVID-19 and influenza-infected patients  and this correlates with disease severity and vasculitis in COVID-19  Expanded KIR     CD8     T cells from these different diseases display shared phenotypes and similar T cell receptor sequences  These results characterize a regulatory CD8     T cell subset in humans  broadly active in both autoimmune and infectious diseases  which we hypothesize functions to control self-reactive or otherwise pathogenic T cells  One-Sentence Summary  Here we identified KIR     CD8     T cells as a regulatory CD8     T cell subset in humans that suppresses self-reactive or otherwise pathogenic CD4     T cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981055
3844,The term cytokine storm refers to an uncontrolled overproduction of soluble inflammatory markers known as cytokines and chemokines  Autoimmune destruction of the lungs triggered by the release of these inflammatory markers often induces acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   ARDS is an emergency condition with a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients  Dexamethasone is the first repurposed corticosteroid with life-saving efficacy in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection  Dexamethasone has traditionally been known to suppress the production of inflammatory markers at the transcriptional level  but its role as a direct therapeutic to neutralize cytokines  chemokines  their receptors  and functionally critical SARS-CoV-2 proteins has not yet been explored  Herein  we demonstrated that dexamethasone binds with high affinity to interlukin-1  IL-1   IL-6  IL-8  IL-12  IL-21  INF2  TGFbeta-1  INF-gamma  CXCL8  some of the receptors  IL-1R  IL-21R  IFNGR  INFAR  IL-6alphaR-gp130  ST2 and the SARS-CoV-2 protein NSP macro X  and 3CLpro  forming stable drug-protein complexes  Our work implied that dexamethasone has the potential to directly neutralize inflammatory markers  further supporting its life-saving potential in patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943719
2874,The introduction of lockdowns and other containment measures during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially altered people s lifestyle and dietary behavior  Several studies evaluated the short-term effects of these measures  yet reports on long-term consequences are scarce  We sought to address this gap in the literature by analyzing dietary and lifestyle data collected at an obesity center in Rome  Italy  The Italian region of Lazio was hit hard by the pandemic  To evaluate the potential health impacts  we compared the pre- and post-lockdown data of 118 individuals  Contrary to the common belief that lockdown had adverse effects solely on people s dietary habits  we observed a significantly increased consumption of raw vegetables  whole grains  and water in our study sample  Favorable effects  however  were also accompanied by adverse trends  such as a higher prevalence of sleeping difficulties  Our data emphasize that the lockdowns associated with the pandemic also influenced participants  social behavior  with less individuals reporting eating out or in company  Our study highlights the substantial impact of lockdowns on many dimensions of life  As such  it is of utmost importance in the critical evaluation of such stringent containment measures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960077
3992,Costimulatory and coinhibitory mechanisms appear to be involved throughout immune responses to control their specificity and level  Many mechanisms operate  therefore  various theoretical models should be considered complementary rather than competing  One such coinhibitory model  pictured in 1971  involves the crosslinking of antigen receptors with inhibitory Fc receptors by antigen antibody complexes  This model was prompted by observations that the Fc portion of antibody was required for potent suppression of immune responses by antibody  The signal via the antigen receptor wakes up T or B cells  providing specificity  while costimulators and coinhibitors stimulate or inhibit these awoken cells  The recent observations that administration of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in early COVID-19 patients inhibits the induction of clinically damaging autoimmune antibodies suggest they may provide negative Fc signals that are blocked in COVID-19 patients  Furthermore  the reduced ability of SARS-CoV-2 antigen to localize to germinal centres in COVID-19 patients also suggests a block in binding of the Fc of antibody bound to antigen on FcgammaRIIb of follicular dendritic cells  The distinction between self and foreign is made not only at the beginning of immune responses but also throughout  and involves multiple mechanisms and models  There are past beginnings  history of models  and current and future beginnings for solving serious clinical problems  such as COVID-19  and different types of models used for understanding the complexities of fundamental immunology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940993
3465,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines  which results in a cytokine storm  and immune-modulators like Mycobacterium indicus pranii  MIP  might ameliorate coronavirus disease of 2019  COVID-19  related cytokine storm  Therefore  the present study evaluates whether MIP offers an advantage in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2  A prospective MIP cohort study was conducted in chest disease hospitals in Srinagar  Jammu and Kashmir  India  In the present prospective  randomized clinical study  critically severe COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups  the MIP group  n   105  and the best standard treatment  BST  group  n   210   Procalcitonin  ferritin  high-sensitive C-reactive protein  D-dimer levels  and interleukin levels on 5th-day posttreatment were significantly reduced in the MIP group compared to the BST group  Compared to the BST group  105 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 in the MIP group reported early weaning off ventilation  resolution of chest architecture  computed tomography  CT  scan   a significant increase in SpO2 levels  and decreased mortality with a hazard ratio  0 234  95  confidence interval  0 264-2 31   p   0 001   MIP restored SpO2   immune inflammatory response  normalized lung abnormalities  chest CT scan   and reduced mortality without any serious complications  However  there is a need for placebo-controlled double-blind and controlled clinical trials to confirm the efficacy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951021

1862,Background Aims  It is widely known that the imbalance between reactive oxygen species  ROS  antioxidants and mitochondrial function could play a pivotal role in aging and in the physiopathology of viral infections  Here  we correlated the plasma oxidants antioxidants levels of the elderly admitted to a long-term care  LTC  unit with clinical data in relation to flu-like disease COVID-19  Moreover  in vitro we examined the effects of plasma on cell viability  ROS release and mitochondrial function  Materials and Methods  In 60 patients admitted to LTC unit for at least 1 year at moderate or high care load  demographic and clinical variables were taken  Blood samples were collected for the evaluations of oxidants antioxidants  as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine  8-isoprostanes  superoxide dismutase activity  glutathione  and vitamin D  In vitro  human umbilical vascular endothelial cells  HUVEC  were used to examine the effects of plasma on viability  ROS release and mitochondrial membrane potential  Results  The results obtained showed that the redox state of the elderly was quite balanced  mitochondrial membrane potential of HUVEC was reduced by about 20   only  Also  the correlation analysis evidenced the association between mitochondrial function and the patients  outcomes  Interestingly  lower levels of mitochondrial membrane potential were found in the elderly who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  Conclusion  The results of this study highlight the importance of mitochondrial function in the tendency to get a flu-like syndrome like COVID-19 in the elderly admitted to LTC unit  This information could have clinical implications for the management of old population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975514
81,Cross-reactivity between different human coronaviruses  HCoVs  might contribute to COVID-19 outcomes  Here  we aimed to predict conserved peptides among different HCoVs that could elicit cross-reacting B cell and T cell responses  Three hundred fifty-one full-genome sequences of HCoVs  including SARS-CoV-2  51   SARS-CoV-1  50   MERS-CoV  50   and common cold species OC43  50   NL63  50   229E  50   and HKU1  50  were downloaded aligned using Geneious Prime 20 20  Identification of epitopes in the conserved regions of HCoVs was carried out using the Immune Epitope Database  IEDB  to predict B- and T-cell epitopes  Further  we identified sequences that bind multiple common MHC and modeled the three-dimensional structures of the protein regions  The search yielded 73 linear and 35 discontinuous epitopes  A total of 16 B-cell and 19 T-cell epitopes were predicted through a comprehensive bioinformatic screening of conserved regions derived from HCoVs  The 16 potentially cross-reactive B-cell epitopes included 12 human proteins and four viral proteins among the linear epitopes  Likewise  we identified 19 potentially cross-reactive T-cell epitopes covering viral proteins  Interestingly  two conserved regions  LSFVSLAICFVIEQF  NSP2  and VVHSVNSLVSSMEVQSL  spike   contained several matches that were described epitopes for SARS-CoV  Most of the predicted B cells were buried within the SARS-CoV-2 protein regions  functional domains  whereas T-cell stretched close to the functional domains  Additionally  most SARS-CoV-2 predicted peptides  80   bound to different HLA types associated with autoimmune diseases  We identified a set of potential B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the HCoVs that could contribute to different diseases manifestation  including autoimmune disorders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006282
4870,A promising approach to tackle the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  could be small interfering  si RNAs  So far it is unclear  which viral replication steps can be efficiently inhibited with siRNAs  Here  we report that siRNAs can target genomic RNA  gRNA  of SARS-CoV-2 after cell entry  and thereby terminate replication before start of transcription and prevent virus-induced cell death  Coronaviruses replicate via negative sense RNA intermediates using a unique discontinuous transcription process  As a result  each viral RNA contains identical sequences at the 5  and 3  end  Surprisingly  siRNAs were not active against intermediate negative sense transcripts  Targeting common sequences shared by all viral transcripts allowed simultaneous suppression of gRNA and subgenomic  sg RNAs by a single siRNA  The most effective suppression of viral replication and spread  however  was achieved by siRNAs that targeted open reading frame 1  ORF1  which only exists in gRNA  In contrast  siRNAs that targeted the common regions of transcripts were outcompeted by the highly abundant sgRNAs leading to an impaired antiviral efficacy  Verifying the translational relevance of these findings  we show that a chemically modified siRNA that targets a highly conserved region of ORF1  inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication ex vivo in explants of the human lung  Our work encourages the development of siRNA-based therapies for COVID-19 and suggests that early therapy start  or prophylactic application  together with specifically targeting gRNA  might be key for high antiviral efficacy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928377

3677,The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has gained worldwide attention and has prompted the development of innovative diagnostics  therapeutics  and vaccines to mitigate the pandemic  Diagnostic methods based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  technology are the gold standard in the fight against COVID-19  However  this test might not be easily accessible in low-resource settings for the early detection and diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   The lack of access to well-equipped clinical laboratories  requirement for the high level of technical competence  and the cost of the RT-PCR test are the major limitations  Moreover  RT-PCR is unsuitable for application at the point-of-care testing  PoCT  as it is time-consuming and lab-based  Due to emerging mutations of the virus and the burden it has placed on the health care systems  there is a growing urgency to develop sensitive  selective  and rapid diagnostic devices for COVID-19  Nanotechnology has emerged as a versatile technology in the production of reliable diagnostic tools for various diseases and offers new opportunities for the development of COVID-19 diagnostic systems  This review summarizes some of the nano-enabled diagnostic systems that were explored for the detection of SARS-CoV-2  It highlights how the unique physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were exploited in the development of novel colorimetric assays and biosensors for COVID-19 at the PoCT  The potential to improve the efficiency of the current assays  as well as the challenges associated with the development of these innovative diagnostic tools  are also discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34947447
4048,There have been multiple reports of patients with coronavirus disease  COVID-19  testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  after discharge  however  information on the characteristics of such cases is limited  In this case report  we aimed to identify clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients who had a repeat positive polymerase chain reaction  PCR  test for SARS-CoV-2  We analyzed data of 22 COVID-19 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on polymerase chain reaction  PCR  testing after two consecutive negative PCR results following discharge from hospitals  The interval between the two positive tests in the episodes of COVID-19 ranged from 4 to 117 days  More than one-third of the cases were healthcare workers  HCWs  and one-third of them had comorbidities  The main symptoms were cough and fever  and we noticed that males experienced more symptoms and signs of COVID-19 than females  Individuals with repeat SARS-CoV-2 positivity tend to experience milder illness during the second episode than the first episode  To confirm the reinfection of SARS-CoV-2  the results of other tests  such as viral culture and immunological assays of immunoglobulin G  IgG  and immunoglobulin M  IgM   need to be considered  Recovered COVID-19 patients should continue social distancing  using face masks  and practicing hand hygiene  especially HCWs who are more likely to be exposed to SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940009
1598,The COVID-19 pandemic imposed profound effects on health and daily life  with widespread stress exposure and increases in psychiatric symptoms  Despite these challenges  pandemic research provides unique insights into individual differences in emotion and cognition that predict responses to stress  with general implications for understanding stress vulnerability  We examined predictors of responses to COVID-19-related stress in an online sample of 450 emerging adults recruited in May 2020 to complete questionnaires assessing baseline stress and psychiatric symptoms  rumination  cognitive reappraisal use and intolerance of uncertainty  Stress and symptoms were re-assessed 3 months later  N   200   Greater pandemic-related stressful events were associated with increases in symptoms of depression  anxiety and alcohol use severity  Additionally  individual differences in emotional and cognitive styles emerged as longitudinal predictors of stress responses  Specifically  greater rumination predicted increased depression  Reduced cognitive reappraisal use interacted with stress to predict increases in alcohol use  An unexpected pattern emerged for intolerance of uncertainty  such that stress was associated with increases in depression for those high in intolerance of uncertainty but increases in alcohol use at relatively low levels of intolerance of uncertainty  These results highlight unique vulnerabilities that predict specific outcomes following stress exposure and offer potential prevention targets,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979053
8746,BACKGROUND  Along with the pandemic situation  information diffusion about the COVID-19 has attracted public attention through social media  The WHO declared an infodemic of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  on February 15  2020  OBJECTIVE  Misinformation and disinformation  including overwhelming amounts of information about COVID-19 from social media  could promote adverse psychological effects  The current study uses the psychological distance of construal level to predict peoples  negative psychological symptoms from social media usage  The psychological distance of construal-level theory  CLT  intends to show peoples  psychological proximity about objects and events  applied to the COVID-19 pandemic situation for this study  Also  this study links the uncertainty reduction strategy  URS  and CLT to preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and affective reactions to see their effects on mental health problems  METHODS  A path model was tested  N 297  with data from an online survey to examine how social media usage behaviors are associated with URS and psychological distance with COVID-19  CLT   leading to preventive behaviors and affective reactions  RESULTS  Finally  the path model was also examined how preventive behaviors and affective reactions are associated with mental health problems  including anxiety and sleep disorder  After measuring participants  social media usage behavior  it is concluded that an increase in general social media usage led to the higher use of URS and lower construal-level on COVID-19  The URS is associated with preventive behaviors  but CLT doesn t show any association with preventive behaviors while it increases affective reactions  Moreover  increased preventive behavior showed negative associations with symptoms of mental health problems  i e   depression and sleep disorder  However  the affective reaction tends to be positively associated with depression and sleep disorder  CONCLUSIONS  Due to the  infodemic  of COVID-19  the psychological perception of the pandemic negatively influenced users  mental health problem  The findings of this study imply that the information from social media usage heightened concerns so that they have lower construal level  which doesn t help them take preventive actions but reinforces the negative emotional reaction and mental health problem  Thus  higher URS is a desirable strategy to be equipped  CLINICALTRIAL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870609

8440,COVID-19 coronavirus disease is an often-severe illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus  The pandemic has demanded a great organization and redistribution of infrastructure and medical resources for the care of patients with cancer  The Gynecology service of the Oncology Hospital of the City of Buenos Aires is a monovalent center dependent on the City of Buenos Aires  It is part of the network of 33 public hospitals in the City of Buenos Aires and receives referrals from other hospitals in the network and from hospitals in the Province of Buenos Aires  As of March 20  2020  when decree 260 20 came into force  which established social  preventive and compulsory isolation  a new modality was started for the care and benefits of our hospital  In our Service of the Hospital de Oncologia de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires we have developed recommendations for the management of gynecological tumors during the COVID-19  The guide we developed is based on up-to-date data and available resources and provides suggestions and tools for decision-making in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with gynecological cancer during the Coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34875603
736,The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed how Canadians access health care  Although it is undeniable that the rapid adoption of virtual care has played a critical role in reducing viral transmission  the gap in equitable access to virtual care remains pervasive for Canada s aging and ethnocultural minority communities  Existing virtual care solutions are designed for the English-speaking  health-literate  and tech-savvy patient population  excluding older ethnic adults who often do not see themselves reflected in these identities  In acknowledging the permanency of virtual care brought on by the pandemic  we have a collective responsibility to co-design new models that serve our older ethnic patients who have been historically marginalized by the status quo  Building on existing foundations of caregiving within ethnocultural minority communities  one viable strategy to realize culturally equitable virtual care may be to engage the highly motivated and skilled family caregivers of older ethnic adults as partners in the technology-mediated management of their chronic disease  The time is now to build a model of shared virtual care that embraces Canada s diverse cultures  while also providing its older ethnic adults with access to health innovations in partnership with equally invested family caregivers who have their health at heart,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994707
3859,Patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  may develop acute respiratory failure  ARF  with compromised gas exchange  These patients require oxygen and possibly ventilatory support  which can be delivered via different devices  Initially  oxygen therapy will often be administered through a conventional binasal oxygen catheter or air-entrainment mask  However  when higher rates of oxygen flow are needed  patients are often stepped up to high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy  HFNC   continuous positive airway pressure  CPAP   bilevel positive airway pressure  BiPAP   or invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   BiPAP  CPAP  and HFNC may be beneficial alternatives to IMV for COVID-19-associated ARF  Current evidence suggests that when nasal catheter oxygen therapy is insufficient for adequate oxygenation of patients with COVID-19-associated ARF  CPAP should be provided for prolonged periods  Subsequent escalation to IMV may be implemented if necessary,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943496

2939,The Coronavirus Disease  COVID-19  pandemic has reshaped clinical chronic disease management  Patients reduced the number of physical clinic visits for regular follow-up care because of the pandemic  However  in developing countries  the scattered healthcare system hindered accessibility to clinical consultation  and poorly controlled chronic diseases resulted in numerous complications  Furthermore  the longer patients suffered from the chronic disease being treated  the more physical and psychological stress they experienced   Diabetes Burnout   as an example  is a term to describe the phenomenon of psychological reluctance in long-term glycemic control  A comprehensive  patient-centered  and automatic drug administration and delivery model may reduce patient stress and increase compliance  Potential next-generation medication platforms  consisting of internal regulation and external interaction  may conduct autonomous dose adjustment and continuous selfmonitoring with the assistance of artificial intelligence  telemedicine  and wireless technologies  Internal regulation forms a closed-loop system in which drug administration is optimized in an implanted drug-releasing device according to a patient s physiopathological response  The other feature  external interaction  creates an ecosystem among patients  healthcare providers  and pharmaceutical researchers to monitor and adjust post-market therapeutic efficacy and safety  These platforms may provide a solution for self-medication and self-care for a wide variety of patients but may be life-changing for patients who live in developing countries where the healthcare system is scattered  as they could effectively remove healthcare barriers  As the technology matures  these self-administrated platforms may become more available and increasingly affordable  offering considerable impact to health and wellness efforts worldwide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958828
4830,Since its early spread in early 2020  the disease caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  has caused mass disruptions to health services  These have included interruptions to programs that aimed to prevent  control  and eliminate neglected tropical diseases  NTDs   In March 2020  the World Health Organization  WHO  released interim guidelines recommending the temporary cessation of mass drug administration  MDA   community-based surveys  and case detection  while encouraging continuation of morbidity management and vector control where possible  Over the course of the following months  national programs and implementing partners contributed to COVID-19 response efforts  while also beginning to plan for resumption of NTD control activities  To understand the challenges  opportunities  and recommendations for maximizing continuity of disease control during public health emergencies  we sought perspectives from Nigeria and Guinea on the process of restarting NTD control efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic  Through semistructured interviews with individuals involved with NTD control at the local and national levels  we identified key themes and common perspectives between the 2 countries  as well as observations that were specific to each  Overall  interviewees stressed the challenges posed by COVID-19 interruptions  particularly with respect to delays to activities and related knock-on impacts  such as drug expiry and prolonged elimination timelines  as well as concerns related to funding  However  respondents in both countries also highlighted the benefits of a formal risk assessment approach  particularly in terms of encouraging information sharing and increasing coordination and advocacy  Recommendations included ensuring greater availability of historical data to allow better monitoring of how future emergencies affect NTD control progress  continuing to use risk assessment approaches in the future  and identifying mechanisms for sharing lessons learned and innovations between countries as a means of advancing postpandemic health systems and disease control capacity strengthening,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928945
411,BACKGROUND  hospitalization rate of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can be considered as an indicator of severe COVID-19 burden  In children  however  hospital admissions may overestimate such burden  OBJECTIVES  to describe the hospitalizations with COVID-19-related discharge diagnoses in the population <18 years of age in the 545 000 inhabitants of the Autonomous Province of Trento  Trentino-Alto Adige Region  North-Eastern Italy  in year 2020  DESIGN  hospitalization characteristics and main and secondary discharge diagnosis codes were abstracted from anonymous hospital discharge records in all cases with at least one COVID-19-specific ICD-9-CM code  SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS  hospitalized patients 0-17 and > 18 years of age  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  in-hospital deaths  median length of stay and cost  frequency of main discharge diagnoses  RESULTS  from March to December 2020  61 admissions with COVID-19-specific codes regarded patients 0-17 years and 3 811 patients > 18 years  No in-hospital deaths were observed in the younger group  Median hospital stay was not significantly different in the two groups  but cost was higher among patients > 18 years  In adult patients  more than 70  had a pneumonia or other lung or respiratory disease main discharge diagnosis  in children  they were only 6 5   Almost half of the children admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection had a main discharge diagnosis of either trauma or encounter with the health system for procedures and aftercare  ICD-9-CM V-codes   CONCLUSIONS  in the Province of Trento  a considerable proportion of hospitalizations of young patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to other underlying conditions requiring hospital care  supporting the hypothesis that hospitalization rate might overestimate the burden of serious COVID-19 in children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35001597
9026,Emerging studies across the globe are reporting the impact of COVID-19 and its related virus containment measures  such as school closures and social distancing  on the mental health presentations and service utilization of children and youth during the early stages of lockdowns in their respective countries  However  there remains a need for studies which examine the impact of COVID-19 on children and youth s mental health needs and service utilization across multiple waves of the pandemic  The present study used data from 35 162 interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health  ChYMH  assessments across 53 participating mental health agencies in Ontario  Canada  to assess the mental health presentations and referral trends of children and youth across the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province  Wave 1 consisted of data from March to June 2020  with Wave 2 consisting of data from September 2020 to January 2021  Data from each wave were compared to each other and to the equivalent period one year prior  While assessment volumes declined during both pandemic waves  during the second wave  child and youth assessments in low-income neighborhoods declined more than those within high-income neighborhoods  There were changes in family stressors noted in both waves  Notably  the proportion of children exposed to domestic violence and recent parental stressors increased in both waves of the pandemic  whereas there were decreases noted in the proportion of parents expressing feelings of distress  anger  or depression and reporting recent family involvement with child protection services  When comparing the two waves  while depressive symptoms and recent self-injurious attempts were more prevalent in the second wave of the pandemic when compared to the first  a decrease was noted in the prevalence of disruptive aggressive behaviors and risk of injury to others from Wave 1 to Wave 2  These findings highlight the multifaceted impact of multiple pandemic waves on children and youth s mental health needs and underscore the need for future research into factors impacting children and youth s access to mental health agencies during this time,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867522
3055,Despite the apparent challenges inflicted by COVID-19 globally  the pandemic provided an opportunity to utilize and expand existing public health capacities for a more adaptive and resilient system during and after each wave of the disease  This paper provides a narrative review of Oman s public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic from January 2020 to July 2021  and the challenges it faced for a more rapid and efficient response  The review demonstrates that the three main pillars influencing the direction of the pandemic and aiding the control are Oman s unified governmental leadership  the move to expand the capacity of the health care system at all levels  and community partnership in all stages of the response including the COVID-19 vaccination campaign  The opportunities identified during response stages in the harmonization of the multisectoral response  streamlining communication channels  addressing vulnerable communities  dormitories  residences at border regions   and providing professional technical leadership provide an excellent precursor for expediting the transformation of Oman s health care system to one with a multisectoral holistic approach  Some of the major challenges faced are the shortage of the public health cadre  lack of a fully integrated digital platform for surveillance  and the scarcity of experts in risk communication and community engagement  A future health system where the center for diseases surveillance and control acts as a nucleus for multisectoral expertise and leadership  which includes community representatives  is crucial to attain optimum health  The destruction inflicted by this prolong COVID-19 pandemic at all levels of human life had valued the importance of investing on preventive and preparedness strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957024

2485,AIMS OF THE STUDY  A new emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  was first identified in Wuhan  China  in December 2019 and then spread rapidly  causing a global pandemic  In Europe  the first case was identified in Italy on 21 February 2020  in the Lombardy region bordering on the southern part of Switzerland  Canton Ticino   where 4 days later the first case was identified   Ticino was the most affected canton in Switzerland during the first wave of pandemic  In order to provide a reliable indicator for the spread of the virus in this region and help decision making at the public health level  a seroprevalence study of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted  METHODS  A cohort study was implemented on a randomly selected sample of 1500 persons  The sample is representative of the general population of the Canton of Ticino  stratified by sex and age from 5 years old  Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were detected using a rapid qualitative test in 4 data collection periods over the course of 12 months  from May-June 2020 to May-June 2021   RESULTS  The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at 9 0  in spring 2020  weeks 20-26   8 4  in summer 2020  weeks 32-38   14 1  in autumn 2020  weeks 45-52  and 22 3  in spring 2021  weeks 18-23   In none of these four phases was evidence of an association between sex or specific age groups and presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected  For risk factors  the only strong and significant association found was with diabetes in the first three data collection periods but not in the fourth  Among people who participated in all four phases of the study and tested positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the first test  61 8  were still positive even in the fourth  12 months later  CONCLUSIONS  The results support the hypothesis that  after one year and despite the severe burden in terms of hospitalisations and deaths experienced by the Canton Ticino  SARS-CoV-2 infection affected only a minority of the population  20   and also suggest that the anti-nucleocapsid antibodies persist after 12 months in the majority of infected persons,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964622
1329,BACKGROUND  The discharge from hospital of insulin-treated hyperglycemic patients is always challenging  This is even more so in patients requiring glucocorticoid treatment  such as those with COVID-19  PATIENTS AND METHODS  A retrospective monocentric study of 23 inpatients with newly diagnosed or already known diabetes mellitus  DM  who were naive to insulin treatment    and who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in non-critical settings and then discharged  Patients were followed-up for one month after discharge for the management of insulin treatment by a multi-professional team through phone consultations  RESULTS  Insulin prescriptions at discharge were 24 6   - 14 U day injected in 2   - 1 5 daily shots  A mean of three phone consultations were required  One month later  the mean insulin reduction was 1 5   - 1 3 shots and 6   - 5 U day  All patients reached their glycemic target without hypoglycemic events  drop-outs  or readmissions  CONCLUSION  This study demonstrates the feasibility  efficacy  and safety of a multi-professional approach through telemedicine for managing DM patients after discharge during COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983355
2254,BACKGROUND  During the long wait and the global anxiety for a vaccine against COVID-19  impressively high-safety and effective vaccines were invented by multiple pharmaceutical companies  AIM  We aimed to assess the attitudes of healthcare providers and evaluate their intention to advocate for the vaccine  METHODS  This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary private hospital where an electronic survey was distributed among healthcare providers  HCPs   The survey contained two sections  socio-demographic characteristics and Likert-scale perception  with 72  internal consistency  RESULTS  The response rate to the email survey was 37   n   236   In addition  169  71 6   of respondents were women  with more than half  134  56 8   aged <  35 years  A total of 110  46 6   had over 10 years of experience  and most of them were nurses  146  62    Univariate analysis revealed that older participants significantly accepted and advocated for the new vaccine more than the younger ones  In the multivariate analysis  men were significantly more likely than women to accept and advocate for the new vaccine  as were those with chronic illnesses  Participants with allergy were significantly less likely to accept the vaccine than others  odds ratio  OR  and p-values were 2 5  0 003  2 3  0 04  and 0 4  0 01  respectively  CONCLUSION  The acceptance rate for the newly-developed COVID-19 vaccines was average among HCPs  Sex  age  presence of chronic illnesses  and allergy were significant predictors of accepting the vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968323
1111,The development of more effective  accessible  and easy to administer COVID-19 vaccines next to the currently marketed mRNA  viral vector  and whole inactivated virus vaccines is essential to curtailing the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  A major concern is reduced vaccine-induced immune protection to emerging variants  and therefore booster vaccinations to broaden and strengthen the immune response might be required  Currently  all registered COVID-19 vaccines and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines in development are intramuscularly administered  targeting the induction of systemic immunity  Intranasal vaccines have the capacity to induce local mucosal immunity as well  thereby targeting the primary route of viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of blocking transmission  Furthermore  intranasal vaccines offer greater practicality in terms of cost and ease of administration  Currently  only eight out of 112 vaccines in clinical development are administered intranasally  We developed an intranasal COVID-19 subunit vaccine  based on a recombinant  six-proline-stabilized  D614G spike protein  mC-Spike  of SARS-CoV-2 linked via the LPS-binding peptide sequence mCramp  mC  to outer membrane vesicles  OMVs  from Neisseria meningitidis  The spike protein was produced in CHO cells  and after linking to the OMVs  the OMV-mC-Spike vaccine was administered to mice and Syrian hamsters via intranasal or intramuscular prime-boost vaccinations  In all animals that received OMV-mC-Spike  serum-neutralizing antibodies were induced upon vaccination  Importantly  high levels of spike-binding immunoglobulin G  IgG  and A  IgA  antibodies in the nose and lungs were only detected in intranasally vaccinated animals  whereas intramuscular vaccination only induced an IgG response in the serum  Two weeks after their second vaccination  hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were protected from weight loss and viral replication in the lungs compared to the control groups vaccinated with OMV or spike alone  Histopathology showed no lesions in lungs 7 days after challenge in OMV-mC-Spike-vaccinated hamsters  whereas the control groups did show pathological lesions in the lung  The OMV-mC-Spike candidate vaccine data are very promising and support further development of this novel non-replicating  needle-free  subunit vaccine concept for clinical testing,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987509

7107,In this article  we examine whether  and by how much  workers in Canada have been compensated for the  novel  risks associated with COVID-19  We create a unique dataset from a system that scores occupations in the US O NET database for COVID-19 exposure  We then combine those COVID exposure scores with Canadian occupational data contained in the Public Use Microdata File of the Labour Force Survey  This allows us to categorize Canadian occupations based on COVID-19 exposure risk  We find a long-tailed distribution of COVID-19 risk scores across occupations  with most jobs at the lower end of the risk spectrum and relatively few occupations accounting for most of the high COVID-19 exposure risk  We find that workers who are already more vulnerable in the labour market  i e  youth  women and immigrants  are also more likely to be employed in occupations with high COVID-19 exposure risk  When we look at the relationship between high-COVID exposure risks in occupation and wages  we find negative compensating differentials both at the mean  negative 8   and across the earnings distribution  However  when workers are covered by a union  they enjoy a sizeable hazard pay premium  11 7  on average  as compared to their non-union counterparts  Furthermore  we find that the moderating effects of unionization for workers at high risk of COVID exposure to be largest at the bottom of the earnings distribution  i e  the 10th percentile of unionized earners receives a 12 3  risk premium for high-COVID exposure  whereas the 90th percentile receives only a 2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898681
2629,Aerosol therapy is used to deliver medical therapeutics directly to the airways to treat respiratory conditions  A potential consequence of this form of treatment is the release of fugitive aerosols  both patient derived and medical  into the environment and the subsequent exposure of caregivers and bystanders to potential viral infections  This study examined the release of these fugitive aerosols during a standard aerosol therapy to a simulated adult patient  An aerosol holding chamber and mouthpiece were connected to a representative head model and breathing simulator  A combination of laser and Schlieren imaging was used to non-invasively visualize the release and dispersion of fugitive aerosol particles  Time-varying aerosol particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured with optical particle sizers at clinically relevant positions to the simulated patient  The influence of breathing pattern  normal and distressed  supplemental air flow  at 0 2 and 6 LPM  and the addition of a bacterial filter to the exhalation port of the mouthpiece were assessed  Images showed large quantities of fugitive aerosols emitted from the unfiltered mouthpiece  The images and particle counter data show that the addition of a bacterial filter limited the release of these fugitive aerosols  with the peak fugitive aerosol concentrations decreasing by 47 3-83 3   depending on distance from the simulated patient  The addition of a bacterial filter to the mouthpiece significantly reduces the levels of fugitive aerosols emitted during a simulated aerosol therapy  p<    05  and would greatly aid in reducing healthcare worker and bystander exposure to potentially harmful fugitive aerosols,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962221

7844,Waiting for an effective treatment against the SARS-CoV-2 virus  the cause of COVID-19   the current alternatives include prevention and the use of vaccines  At the moment  vaccination is the most effective strategy in the fight against pandemic  Vaccines can be administered with different natural biological products  adjuvants  with immunomodulating properties  Adjuvants can be taken orally  complementing vaccine action  Adjuvant compounds could play a key role in alleviating the symptoms of the disease  as well as in enhancing vaccine action  Adjuvants also contribute to an effective immune response and can enhance the protective effect of vaccines in immunocompromised individuals such as the elderly  Adjuvants must not produce adverse effects  toxicity  or any other symptoms that could alter immune system function  Vaccine adjuvants are substances of wide varying chemical structure that are used to boost the immune response against a simultaneously administered antigen  Glucans could work as adjuvants due to their immunomodulatory biological activity  In this respect  beta- 1 3 - 1 6  glucans are considered the most effective and safe according to the list issued by the European Commission  Only glucans with a beta- 1 3  bond linked to a beta- 1 6  are considered modulators of certain biological responses  The aim of this review is to present the possible effects of beta-glucans as adjuvants in the efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 virus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886361
6231,Research Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic will rank among the greatest challenges many executives will have faced and not only due to the operational challenges it posed  Upon entering the U S  context  the disease was immediately politically polarized  with clear partisan splits forming in risk perceptions of the disease unrelated to science  We exploit this context to examine whether firms  partisan positioning affects whether and how they communicate risk to their investors on a polarized public policy issue  To do so  we examine the covariation between firms  disclosure of COVID-19 risks and the partisanship of their political giving  Our analysis of earnings call and campaign contribution data for the S P 500 reveals a positive association between a firm s contributions to Democrats and its disclosure of COVID-19 risks  Managerial Summary  From its onset in the United States  attitudes toward and discourse around the COVID-19 pandemic was heavily politicized and perceptions of the disease s risks were seen as more serious by Democratic-identifying individuals than Republican identifiers  In this study  we examine whether this pattern also holds for U S  publicly traded firms  who can also stake out a political position through their corporate political action committee campaign contributions  In analyses of earnings call transcripts from the first quarter of 2020  we show that the more Republican-leaning  Democrat-leaning  a firm s campaign contributions are  the less  more  likely it was to voluntarily disclose risks related to COVID-19  We argue that these findings hold implications for parties interested in interpreting firm s risk disclosures on politically polarized issues,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908629
6306,BACKGROUND  The association between coronavirus infection 2019  COVID-19  and thrombosis has been explicitly shown through numerous reports that demonstrate high rates of thrombotic complications in infected patients  Recently  much evidence has shown that patients who survived COVID-19 might have a high thrombotic risk after hospital discharge  This current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to better understand the incidence of thrombosis  bleeding  and mortality rates among patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization  METHODS  Using a search strategy that included terms for postdischarge  thrombosis  and COVID-19  2 investigators independently searched for published articles indexed in the MEDLINE  Embase  and Scopus databases that were published before August 2021  Pooled incidences and 95  confidence intervals were calculated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with a double arcsine transformation  RESULTS  Twenty articles were included in the meta-analysis  They provided a total of 19 461 patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization  The weighted pooled incidence of overall thrombosis among the patients was 1 3   95 CI  0  6-2  I 2  90 5   with a pooled incidence of venous thrombosis of 0 7   95 CI  0  4-1  I 2  73 9  and a pooled incidence of arterial thrombosis of 0 6   95 CI  0  2-1  I 2  88 1   The weighted pooled incidences of bleeding and mortality were 0 9   95 CI  0  1-1 9  I 2  95 1  and 2 8   95 CI  0  6-5  I 2  98 2   respectively  CONCLUSIONS  The incidences of thrombosis and bleeding in patients discharged after COVID-19 hospitalization are comparable to those of medically ill patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907791
196,A 63-year-old male  with no significant past history and not on any regular medications previously  had mild respiratory symptoms post the first dose of the AstraZeneca  Cambridge  England  coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccine  which were self-limiting  Following the second dose of the vaccine  he arrived at the emergency department  ED  with worsening shortness of breath  During this admission  he was assumed to have interstitial lung disease due to a possible past history of occupational exposure  He responded to a short-term course of corticosteroids and antibiotics and was discharged home  However  he reported again to the emergency department three weeks later  with persistent dyspnoea along with myalgia  His blood tests and imaging from scans suggested myositis  pneumonitis  and myopericarditis  Since he recently had the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine  it was postulated as the most likely cause of the symptoms  He was managed with intravenous  IV  corticosteroids followed by oral corticosteroids with symptom resolution,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004093
3454,The current research examined the role of values in guiding people s responses to COVID-19  Results from an international study involving 115 countries  N   61 490  suggest that health and economic threats of COVID-19 evoke different values  with implications for controlling and coping with the pandemic  Specifically  health threats predicted prioritization of communal values related to caring for others and belonging  whereas economic threats predicted prioritization of agentic values focused on competition and achievement  Concurrently and over time  prioritizing communal values over agentic values was associated with enactment of prevention behaviors that reduce virus transmission  motivations to help others suffering from the pandemic  and positive attitudes toward outgroup members  These results  which were generally consistent across individual and national levels of analysis  suggest that COVID-19 threats may indirectly shape important responses to the pandemic through their influence on people s prioritization of communion and agency  Theoretical and practical implications are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951330
3772,The spread of COVID-19 has affected not only public health but also agriculture  raising global concerns regarding the food system  As an immediate impact of COVID-19  farmers around the globe have had difficulties with sales  resulting in large amounts of overstocked agricultural products and food loss  This further threatens the livelihood of rural  poor farmers and impacts sustainable production  To provide a better understanding of the overstocking situation after the outbreak of the pandemic  this study depicts the distribution characteristics of overstocked agricultural products in China  After analyzing a nationwide data set collected from 3482 individuals organizations by the Chinese Agri-products Marketing Association after the outbreak of the pandemic  we found that some of the initial prevention and control measures disrupted sales channels  and in turn  caused the farmers to suffer losses  The impact was more severe in perishable products and their production areas  as well as in poverty-stricken regions  Then  we identified China s quick and effective actions to match the supply and demand  These findings suggest that emergency responses should coordinate the relationship between emergency actions and the necessary logistics of agricultural production  To prepare for the possibility of such shock in the future  the government should take actions to clear logistics obstacles for necessary transportation  keep enhancing the fundamental infrastructure and effective mechanism of the food supply chain  and actively include innovative techniques to build a more resilient food system,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945577
6681,Background  Male androgenetic alopecia  AGA  has been implicated as a putative risk factor in severe COVID-19 based on high incidences of advanced AGA in male hospitalized COVID-19 patients  Research further suggests that androgen signalling  which plays a central role in AGA aetiology  promotes SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms in men  Objectives  We aimed to systematically investigate a potential association between AGA and COVID-19 both on an epidemiological and a genetic level in a large single-population cohort  Methods  We performed regression  genetic correlation and polygenic risk score  PRS  analyses using data from the UK Biobank and published GWAS data on AGA and COVID-19  Results  Our analyses did not reveal any significant epidemiological or genome-wide genetic association between AGA and severe COVID-19  Pathway-based PRS analyses however revealed a significant association in specific pathways  namely vitamin metabolism  natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity  WNT signalling and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signalling  Limitations  We restricted our analyses to the white British population and used self-reported AGA status  Sample size may be a limitation in our regression and PRS analyses  Conclusions  Our data yield no evidence for an epidemiological association between AGA and COVID-19 but suggest that a shared genetic basis for both traits exists in specific pathways,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901950
3997,The 4 th  International Conference on Controversies in Vitamin D was held as a virtual meeting in September  2020  gathering together leading international scientific and medical experts in vitamin D  Since vitamin D has a crucial role in skeletal and extra-skeletal systems  the aim of the Conference was to discuss improved management of vitamin D dosing  therapeutic levels and form or route of administration in the general population and in different clinical conditions  A tailored approach  based on the specific mechanisms underlying vitamin D deficiency in different diseases that were discussed  was recommended  Specifically  in comparison to healthy populations  higher levels of vitamin D and greater amounts of vitamin D were deemed necessary in osteoporosis  diabetes mellitus  obesity  particularly after bariatric surgery   and in those treated with glucocorticoids  Emerging and still open issues were related to target vitamin D levels and the role of vitamin D supplementation in COVID-19 since low vitamin D may predispose to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to worse COVID-19 outcomes  Finally  whereas oral daily cholecalciferol appears to be the preferred choice for vitamin D supplementation in the general population  and in most clinical conditions  active vitamin D analogs may be indicated in patients with hypoparathyroidism and severe kidney and liver insufficiency  Parenteral vitamin D administration could be helpful in malabsorption syndromes or in states of vitamin D resistance Specific guidelines for desired levels of vitamin D should be tailored to the different conditions affecting vitamin D metabolism with the goal to define disease-specific normative values,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940947
7653,The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a world surprisingly unprepared to respond to the new epidemiological scenario  even the developed countries  in spite of warnings from scientists since the 1990s  These alerts warned on the risks of an exponential increase in emergence of potentially pandemic zoonotic infectious diseases related to disruptive ecological niches in different regions of the globe  such as H1N1 Influenza  SARS  MERS  Zika  avian flu  swine flu  and Ebola  and also on the risks of a future and more lethal Disease X  We examine this global public health failure in anticipating and responding to the pandemic  stressing the urgent need for an innovative global pandemic preparedness system in the current transition from linear economy to a circular economy  Evidence provided here indicates that this novel preventive-based and resource-saving preparedness system could contribute to reverse the detrimental impacts of the pandemic on global economy and increase its resilience  Individual protection  contact tracing  and lockdown have proved to be just partially effective to respond to the spillover of viral zoonosis into the human population  and for most of these pathogens  vaccines are not yet available  As for COVID-19 vaccines  in spite of the extraordinary investments and unprecedented advances in innovative vaccines in few months  most of these products are expected to be available to more vulnerable developing countries  populations only by mid-2022  Furthermore  even when these vaccines are available  constraints such as low efficacy  waning immunity  new concerning COVID-19 variants  adverse events  and vaccine hesitancy might possibly restrict their public health impact and could contribute to aggravate the pandemic scenario  Considering these constraints and the severe global economic and social crises resulting from the lack of adequate preparedness and delayed effective response to COVID-19 and possibly to a future Disease X  we propose a pro-active global eco-social pandemic preparedness system  This novel system  based on One Health paradigm and on artificial intelligence and machine learning  is expected to incorporate  spillover  foresight and management into global preparedness and timely response  Designed to mitigate damage from outbreaks and minimize human morbidity and mortality  this approach to pandemic foresight and preparedness will be key to prevent a global disaster,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888566
1699,Objective  To present a large registry data assessing the association between myocarditis and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  Patients and Methods  The researchers identified adult patients aged 18-90 years with COVID-19 diagnosis in the TriNetX  COVID-19 research network  database between January 20  2020  and December 9  2020  These patients were then divided into those who had a positive myocarditis diagnosis and those who did not  The researchers compared all-cause mortality between propensity-matched  PSM  pairs of patients in both groups  Results  Total of 259 352 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were included in the study  Of those patients  383  0 01   had myocarditis diagnosis  while 258 969  99 9   did not have myocarditis diagnosis during their hospital stay  Patients were more male in the myocarditis group  58 75  vs  44 73   P < 0 001   As to the PSM cohorts  383 383 were matched  and the all-cause mortality was 13 4   vs  4 2   P < 0 001  at 30 days  A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also statistically significant  P < 0 001  at 30 days  Conclusion  In a large multinational database of COVID-19 patients  we observed an association between myocarditis diagnosis and increased mortality  Further prospective studies are recommended to further assess myocarditis outcomes in COVID-19 patients and treatment options,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977468

9779,With the ongoing worldwide coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  it is desirable to develop effective algorithms for the automatic detection of COVID-19 with chest computed tomography  CT  images  As deep learning has achieved breakthrough results in numerous computer vision and image understanding tasks  a good choice is to consider diagnosis models based on deep learning  Recently  a considerable number of methods have indeed been proposed  However  training an accurate deep learning model requires a large-scale chest CT dataset  which is hard to collect due to the high contagiousness of COVID-19  To achieve improved COVID-19 detection performance  this paper proposes a hybrid framework that fuses the complex shearlet scattering transform  CSST  and a suitable convolutional neural network into a single model  The introduced CSST cascades complex shearlet transforms with modulus nonlinearities and low-pass filter convolutions to compute a sparse and locally invariant image representation  The features computed from the input chest CT images are discriminative for the detection of COVID-19  Furthermore  a wide residual network with a redesigned residual block  WR2N  is developed to learn more granular multiscale representations by applying it to scattering features  The combination of the model-based CSST and data-driven WR2N leads to a more convenient neural network for image representation  where the idea is to learn only the image parts that the CSST cannot handle instead of all parts  The experimental results obtained on two public chest CT datasets for COVID-19 detection demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method  We can obtain more accurate results than several state-of-the-art COVID-19 classification methods in terms of measures such as accuracy  the F1-score  and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855604

715,BACKGROUND  Innovative surveillance methods are needed to assess adherence to COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home order self-quarantine recommendations  especially methods that can provide near real-time and or highly geographically targeted data  Use of location-based social media image data is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem  OBJECTIVE  We sought to evaluate whether publicly-available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence  METHODS  We collected a sample of 43 487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11  2020 from the following location hashtags   Centralpark  N   20 937    Brooklyn Bridge  N   14 875   and  Timesquare  N   7 675   After manually reviewing images for accuracy  we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time  as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing  i e   whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others versus next to or touching each other   We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations  RESULTS  We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions  with an approximate decline of 17  across each site  p<  001   We found a positive correlation between hashtags   Centralpark  Brooklynbridge  r  40     BrooklynBridge  Timesquare  r  41     Timesquare  Centralpark  r  33  p<  001 for all correlations   The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Times Square  p< 05  and Brooklyn Bridge  p <  05   but not for Central Park  CONCLUSIONS  Results suggest the potential of using location-based social media image data as a method for surveillance of COVID-19 health policy adherence  Future studies should further explore the implementation and ethical issues associated with this approach  CLINICALTRIAL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995205
2718,A microarray-based assay to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against betacoronaviruses  SARS-CoV-2  SARS  MERS  OC43  and HKU1   other respiratory viruses and type I interferons  IFN-Is  was developed  This multiplex assay was applied to track antibody cross-reactivity due to previous contact with similar viruses and to identify antibodies against IFN-Is as the markers for severe COVID-19  In total  278 serum samples from convalescent plasma donors  COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit  ICU  and patients who recovered from mild moderate COVID-19  vaccine recipients  prepandemic and pandemic patients with autoimmune endocrine disorders  and a heterogeneous prepandemic cohort including healthy individuals and chronically ill patients were analyzed  The anti-SARS-CoV-2 microarray results agreed well with the ELISA results  Regarding ICU patients  autoantibodies against IFN-Is were detected in 10 5  of samples  and 10 5  of samples were found to simultaneously contain IgM antibodies against more than two different viruses  Cross-reactivity between IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and IgG against the OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins was observed  resulting in positive signals for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in prepandemic samples from patients with autoimmune endocrine disorders  The presence of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid in the absence of IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD should be interpreted with caution,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960822
1414,A cross-sectional survey of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic dogs and cats was conducted in high-risk areas  five subdistricts of Samut Sakhon Province  the epicenter of the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand in February 2021  A total of 523 swab samples  nasal  oral  and rectal swabs  and 159 serum samples from dogs  n   83  and cats  n   93  were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies  All swab samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR with three panels of specific primers and probes  Although all dogs and cats were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA  3 14   5 159  had anti-N-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by indirect multispecies ELISA  Our results demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 exposure in domestic animals living in high-risk areas during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand  Thus  the use of one health approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals in high-risk areas of COVID-19 outbreaks should be routinely conducted and will provide benefits to risk communications in communities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981900
9391,BACKGROUND  We investigated the feasibility of two biomarkers of endothelial damage  Syndecan-1 and thrombomodulin  in coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   and their association with inflammation  coagulopathy  and mortality  METHODS  The records of 49 COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit  ICU  in Wuhan  China between February and April 2020 were examined  Demographic  clinical  and laboratory data  and outcomes were compared between survivors and non-survivors COVID-19 patients  and between patients with high and low serum Syndecan-1 levels  The dynamics of serum Syndecan-1 levels were also analyzed  RESULTS  The levels of Syndecan-1 were significantly higher in non-survivor group compared with survivor group  median 1031 4 versus 504 0 ng mL  P   0 002   and the levels of thrombomodulin were not significantly different between these two groups  median 4534 0 versus 3780 0 ng mL  P   0 070   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the group with high Syndecan-1 levels had worse overall survival  log-rank test  P   0 023   Patients with high Syndecan-1 levels also had significantly higher levels of thrombomodulin  interleukin-6  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha  Data on the dynamics of Syndecan-1 levels indicated much greater variations in non-survivors than survivors  CONCLUSIONS  COVID-19 patients with high levels of Syndecan-1 develop more serious endothelial damage and inflammatory reactions  and have increased mortality  Syndecan-1 has potential for use as a marker for progression or severity of COVID-19  Protecting the glycocalyx from destruction is a potential treatment for COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861818
8545,Viral outbreaks had been a threat for the human race for a long time  Several epidemics and pandemics have been reported in the past with serious consequences on human health and subsequent social and economic aspects  According to WHO  viral infections continue to be a major health concern globally  Novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  causes the most recent infectious pandemic disease  COVID-19  Coronavirus disease-19   As of now  there were 249 million infections of COVID-19 worldwide with a high mortality of more than 5 million deaths reported  and the number of new additional cases is drastically increasing  Development of therapies to treat the infected cases and prophylactic agents including vaccines that are effective towards different variants are crucial to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic  Owing to the fact that there is a high mortality and morbidity rate along with the risk of virus causing further epidemic outbursts  development of additional effective therapeutic and preventive strategies are highly warranted  Prevention  early detection and treatment will reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic  The present review highlights the novel mutations and therapeutic updates associated with coronaviruses along with the clinical manifestations-diagnosis  clinical management and  prophylactic and therapeutic strategies of COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873656
3433,BACKGROUND  Intubation  laryngoscopy and extubation are considered highly aerosol-generating procedures  and additional safety protocols are used during COVID-19 pandemic in these procedures  However  previous studies are mainly experimental and have neither analyzed staff exposure to aerosol generation in the real-life operating room environment nor compared the exposure to aerosol concentrations generated during normal patient care  To assess operational staff exposure to potentially infectious particle generation during general anesthesia  we measured particle concentration and size distribution with patients undergoing surgery with Optical Particle Sizer  METHODS  A single-center observative multidisciplinary clinical study in Helsinki University Hospital with 39 adult patients who underwent general anesthesia with tracheal intubation  Mean particle concentrations during different anesthesia procedures were statistically compared with cough control data collected from 37 volunteers to assess the differences in particle generation  RESULTS  This study measured 25 preoxygenations  30 mask ventilations  28 intubations and 24 extubations  The highest total aerosol concentration of 1153 particles  p  cm 3  was observed during mask ventilation  Preoxygenations  mask ventilations and extubations as well as uncomplicated intubations generated mean aerosol concentrations statistically comparable to coughing  It is noteworthy that difficult intubation generated significantly fewer aerosols than either uncomplicated intubation  p 0 007  or coughing  p 0 006   CONCLUSIONS  Anesthesia induction generates mainly small  <1 microm  aerosol particles  Based on our results  general anesthesia procedures are not highly aerosol-generating compared with coughing  Thus  their definition as high-risk aerosol-generating procedures should be re-evaluated due to comparable exposures during normal patient care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951703
2201,Objective  To explore the impact of lockdown due to coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  on the subjective well-being of migrant workers staying in a shelter home in India  Methods  A total of 54 residents of the shelter home participated in this exploratory survey study  Baseline assessments included sociodemographic profile  the Subjective Well-Being Inventory  SUBI   and the Perceived Stress Scale  The participants were reassessed with the SUBI after 2 weeks of staying in the shelter home  The survey was administered April 11 to May 10  2020  Results  The mean   - SD age of the participants was 23 54   - 11 68 years  and the majority were men and in the age group 21-30 years  45    At baseline assessments  the mean   - SD stress level score was 17 39  -4 62  The mean   - SD SUBI score was 81 44   - 4 62 at baseline and increased to 100 65  -5 95 after 2 weeks of staying in the shelter home  Conclusions  The survey findings demonstrate that the levels of subjective well-being among participants improved after their physical and mental health needs were met during their stay in the shelter home  The findings could help policy planners and senior public health administrators minimize gaps to better understand the multiple issues related to the subjective well-being of this population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969183
754,COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the virus 2019-nCoV  a single-stranded RNA virus  During the infection and transmission processes  the virus evolves and mutates rapidly  though the disease has been quickly controlled in Wuhan by  Fangcang  hospitals  To model the virulence evolution  in this paper  we formulate a new age structured epidemic model  Under the tradeoff hypothesis  two special scenarios are used to study the virulence evolution by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations  Results show that  before  Fangcang  hospitals  two scenarios are both consistent with the data  After  Fangcang  hospitals  Scenario I rather than Scenario II is consistent with the data  It is concluded that the transmission pattern of COVID-19 in Wuhan obey Scenario I rather than Scenario II  Theoretical analysis show that  in Scenario I  shortening the value of L  diagnosis period  can result in an enormous selective pressure on the evolution of 2019-nCoV,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994299
8174,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the effectiveness of remote proactive management of toxicities during chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer  DESIGN  Pragmatic  cluster randomised trial  SETTING  20 cancer centres in Ontario  Canada  allocated by covariate constrained randomisation to remote management of toxicities or routine care  PARTICIPANTS  All patients starting adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer at each centre  25 patients from each centre completed patient reported outcome questionnaires  INTERVENTIONS  Proactive  standardised  nurse led telephone management of common toxicities at two time points after each chemotherapy cycle  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  The primary outcome  cluster level mean number of visits to the emergency department or admissions to hospital per patient during the whole course of chemotherapy treatment  was evaluated with routinely available administrative healthcare data  Secondary patient reported outcomes included toxicity  self-efficacy  and quality of life  RESULTS  Baseline characteristics of participants were similar in the intervention  n 944  and control arms  n 1214   22  were older than 65 years  Penetration  that is  the percentage of patients who received the intervention at each centre  was 50-86   Mean number of visits to the emergency department or admissions to hospital per patient was 0 91  standard deviation 0 28  in the intervention arm and 0 94  0 40  in the control arm  P 0 94   47   1014 of 2158 patients  had at least one visit to the emergency department or a hospital admission during chemotherapy  Among 580 participants who completed the patient reported outcome questionnaires  at least one grade 3 toxicity was reported by 48   134 of 278 patients  in the intervention arm and by 58   163 of 283  in the control arm  No differences in self-efficacy  anxiety  or depression were found  Compared with baseline  the functional assessment of cancer therapy trial outcome index decreased by 6 1 and 9 0 points in the intervention and control participants  respectively  CONCLUSIONS  Proactive  telephone based management of toxicities during chemotherapy did not result in fewer visits to the emergency department or hospital admissions  With the rapid rise in remote care because of the covid-19 pandemic  identifying scalable strategies for remote management of patients during cancer treatment is particularly relevant  TRIAL REGISTRATION  ClinicalTrials gov NCT02485678,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34880055
9528,Background  The probable impact of a maintenance immunosuppressant  IS  on liver transplant  LT  recipients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  remains unexplored  Our specific aim was to approximate the prognosis of LT recipients with COVID-19 on the standard maintenance IS  Method  We searched separate databases for the qualified studies in between December 2019 and June 25  2021  Ultimately  a meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity  Results  In a total of eight studies and 509 LT recipients with COVID-19  the pooled rates of severity and mortality during all the combined immunosuppressive therapies were 22 4 and 19 5   respectively  Our study sufficiently showed that an immunosuppressive therapy in LT recipients with COVID-19 was significantly associated with a non-severe COVID-19  odds ratio  OR   11 49  95  CI  4 17-31 65  p < 0 001  and the survival of the patients  OR  17 64  95  CI  12 85-24 22  p < 0 001   Moreover  mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor  mTORi  typically had the lowest rate of severity and mortality compared to other ISs such as calcineurin inhibitors  CNIs   steroids  and antimetabolites  i e   severity  13 5 vs  21 1  24 7  and 26 3   and mortality  8 3 vs  15  17 2  and 12 1    respectively  Contrary to the general opinions  our meta-analysis showed comorbidities such as diabetes  hypertension  cardiopulmonary disorders  chronic kidney disease  CKD   age >60  the duration of LT to the diagnosis of COVID-19  primary disease for LT  and obesity were not significantly associated with the severity and mortality in LT recipients with COVID-19 under an immunosuppressive therapy  However  our pooled analysis found that LT recipients with COVID-19 and without comorbidities have a less severe disease and low mortality rate compared to those with both COVID-19 and comorbidities  Conclusions  In conclusion  LT recipients with COVID-19 undergoing immunosuppressive therapies are not significantly associated with the severity and mortality  Therefore  taking the risk of organ rejection into a key consideration  a complete withdrawal of the IS may not be wise  However  mycophenolate mofetil  MMF  might be discontinued or replaced from an immunosuppressive regimen with the CNIs- or mTORis-based immunosuppressive therapy in some selected LT recipients with COVID-19  depending upon the severity of the disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859012
9214,BACKGROUND  In the absence of a vaccine  the global spread of COVID-19 during 2020 has necessitated non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the rise of cases  PURPOSE  The article uses the health belief model and a novel rapid mobile survey to examine correlates of reported mask-wearing as a non-pharmaceutical intervention in South Africa between May and August 2020  METHODS  Two-way tabulations and multivariable analysis via logistic regression modeling describe correlations between reported mask-wearing and factors of interest among a sample of 7074 adults in a two-period national longitudinal survey  the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey  NIDS-CRAM   RESULTS  In line with the health belief model  results showed that self-efficacy  the prevalence of others  mask-wearing in the same district  and affluence were positively associated with reported mask-wearing  Those who reported staying at home were significantly less likely to report wearing a mask  There was little evidence that the expected severity of the disease if contracted  affects these decisions  Hypertension  obesity  or being overweight  measured three years earlier  did not have a significant association with mask-wearing  The prevalence of mask-wearing increased significantly from May to August 2020 as COVID-19 cases increased and lockdown restrictions were eased  Contrary to the health belief model  we found that despite having a higher mortality risk  the elderly had significantly lower odds of mask-wearing  CONCLUSION  In South Africa  the mask-wearing adherence has increased rapidly  It is concerning that the elderly had lower odds of mask-wearing  This should be examined further in future research,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865174
2636,SARS-CoV-2 variants are of particular interest because they can potentially increase the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 or reduce the effectiveness of available vaccines  However  screening SARS-CoV-2 variants is a challenge because biosensors target viral components that can mutate  One promising strategy is to screen variants via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2   a virus receptor shared by all known SARS-CoV-2 variants  Here we designed a highly sensitive and portable COVID-19 screening biosensor based on the virus receptor  We chose a dual-gate field-effect transistor to overcome the low sensitivity of virus-receptor-based biosensors  To optimize the biosensor  we introduced a synthetic virus that mimics the important features of SARS-CoV-2  size  bilayer structure  and composition   The developed biosensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in 20 min and showed sensitivity comparable to that of molecular diagnostic tests   approximately 165 copies mL   Our results indicate that a virus-receptor-based biosensor can be an effective strategy for screening infectious diseases to prevent pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962130
3794,The clinical characteristics of patients with N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2 variants  N501YV  is not fully understood  especially in the setting of general practice  In this retrospective cohort study  COVID-19 patients admitted to one general practitioner clinic between 26 March and 26 May 2021 were retrospectively analyzed  The characteristics  clinical symptoms and radiological findings before treatment were compared between N501YV and wild-type 501N  Twenty-eight patients were classified as wild-type 501N and 24 as N501YV  The mean    -standard deviation  age was 37 4    -16 1  years  with no significant difference between groups  Among clinical symptoms  prevalence of fever of 38 degrees Celsius   degrees C  or higher was significantly higher in the N501YV group than in the wild-type 501N group  p   0 001   Multivariate analysis showed that fever of 38 degrees C or higher remained significantly associated with N501YV  adjust odds ratio  aOR   6 07  95  confidence interval  CI   1 68 to 21 94   For radiological findings  the lung involvement area was significantly larger in patients infected with N501YV  p   0 013   In conclusion  in the N501YV group  fever of 38 degrees C or higher and extensive pneumonia were more frequently observed compared to the wild-type 501N group  There was no significant difference in terms of other demographics and clinical symptoms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945159
3133,The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed major gaps in our understanding of the transmission of viruses through the air  These gaps slowed recognition of airborne transmission of the disease  contributed to muddled public health policies and impeded clear messaging on how best to slow transmission of COVID-19  In particular  current recommendations have been based on four tenets   i  respiratory disease transmission routes can be viewed mostly in a binary manner of  droplets  versus  aerosols    ii  this dichotomy depends on droplet size alone   iii  the cut-off size between these routes of transmission is 5 microm  and  iv  there is a dichotomy in the distance at which transmission by each route is relevant  Yet  a relationship between these assertions is not supported by current scientific knowledge  Here  we revisit the historical foundation of these notions  and how they became entangled from the 1800s to today  with a complex interplay among various fields of science and medicine  This journey into the past highlights potential solutions for better collaboration and integration of scientific results into practice for building a more resilient society with more sound  far-sighted and effective public health policies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956601

9130,The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory response  however  the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation is poorly understood  Here  we investigated direct inflammatory functions of major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2  We observed that spike  S  protein potently induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  including IL-6  IL-1beta  TNFalpha  CXCL1  CXCL2  and CCL2  but not IFNs in human and mouse macrophages  No such inflammatory response was observed in response to membrane  M   envelope  E   and nucleocapsid  N  proteins  When stimulated with extracellular S protein  human and mouse lung epithelial cells also produced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  Interestingly  epithelial cells expressing S protein intracellularly were non-inflammatory  but elicited an inflammatory response in macrophages when co-cultured  Biochemical studies revealed that S protein triggers inflammation via activation of the NF-kappaB pathway in a MyD88-dependent manner  Further  such an activation of the NF-kappaB pathway was abrogated in Tlr2-deficient macrophages  Consistently  administration of S protein-induced IL-6  TNF-alpha  and IL-1beta in wild-type  but not Tlr2-deficient mice  Notably  upon recognition of S protein  TLR2 dimerizes with TLR1 or TLR6 to activate the NF-kappaB pathway  Taken together  these data reveal a mechanism for the cytokine storm during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that TLR2 could be a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866574
2955,Pharmacogenomics is universally relevant for worldwide modern therapeutics and yet needs further development in resource-limited countries  While there is an abundance of genetic association studies in controlled medical settings  there is a paucity of studies with a naturalistic design in real-life clinical practice in patients with comorbidities and under multiple drug treatment regimens  African patients are often burdened with communicable and noncommunicable comorbidities  yet the application of pharmacogenomics in African clinical settings remains limited  Using warfarin as a model  this study aims at minimizing gaps in precision personalized medicine research in African clinical practice  We present  therefore  pharmacogenomic profiles of a cohort of 503 black Africans  n   252  and Mixed Ancestry  n   251  patients from Southern Africa  on warfarin and co-prescribed drugs in a naturalized noncontrolled environment  Seventy-three  n   73  single nucleotide polymorphisms  SNPs  in 29 pharmacogenes were characterized using a combination of allelic discrimination  Sanger sequencing  restriction fragment length polymorphism  and Sequenom Mass Array  The common comorbidities were hypertension  43-46    heart failure  39-45    diabetes mellitus  18    arrhythmia  25    and HIV infection  15    Accordingly  the most common co-prescribed drugs were antihypertensives  antiarrhythmic drugs  antidiabetics  and antiretroviral therapy  We observed marked variation in major pharmacogenes both at interethnic levels and within African subpopulations  The Mixed Ancestry group presented a profile of genetic variants reflecting their European  Asian  and African admixture  Precision medicine requires that African populations begin to capture their own pharmacogenetic SNPs as they cannot always infer with absolute certainty from Asian and European populations  In the current historical moment of the COVID-19 pandemic  we also underscore that the spectrum of drugs interacting with warfarin will likely increase  given the systemic and cardiovascular effects of COVID-19  and the anticipated influx of COVID-19 medicines in the near future  This observational clinical pharmacogenomics study of warfarin  together with past precision medicine research  collectively  lends strong support for incorporation of pharmacogenetic profiling in clinical settings in African patients for effective and safe administration of therapeutics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958284

5112,Ferritin  which includes twenty-four light and heavy chains in varying proportions in different tissues  is primarily responsible for maintaining the body s iron metabolism  Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL -1  in men and between 30-300 ngmL -1  in women  Iron is delivered to the tissue via them  and they act as immunomodulators  signaling molecules  and inflammatory markers  When ferritin level exceeds 1000 microgL -1   the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia  Iron chelators such as deferiprone  deferirox  and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload  The inflammation cascade and poor prognosis of COVID-19 may be attributed to high ferritin levels  Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox  an iron chelator administered orally at 20-40 mgkg -1  once daily  as well as intravenous deferoxamine at 1000 mg initially followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours  It can be combined with monoclonal antibodies  antioxidants  corticosteroids  and lactoferrin to make iron chelation therapy effective for COVID-19 victims  In this article  we analyze the antiviral and antifibrotic activity of iron chelators  thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a potentially innovative treatment strategy for COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924800
4398,Negative impacts of COVID-19 on human health and economic and social activities urge scientists to develop effective treatments  Baicalin is a natural flavonoid  extracted from a traditional medicinal plant  previously reported with anti-inflammatory activity  In this study  we used pharmacophore fitting and molecular docking to screen and determine docking patterns and the binding affinity of baicalin on 3 major targets of SARS-CoV-2  3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease  3CLpro   papain-like protease  PLpro   and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase   The obtained data revealed that baicalin has high pharmacophore fitting on 3CLpro and predicted good binding affinity on PLpro  Moreover  using the enzymatic assay  we examined the inhibitory effect of baicalin in vitro on the screened enzymes  Baicalin also exhibits inhibitory effect on these proteases in vitro  Additionally  we performed pharmacophore-based screening of baicalin on human targets and conducted pathway analysis to explore the potential cytoprotective effects of baicalin in the host cell that may be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment  The result suggested that baicalin has multiple targets in human cell that may induce multiple pharmacological effects  The result of pathway analysis implied that these targets may be associated with baicalin-induced bioactivities that are involved with signals of pro-inflammation factors  such as cytokine and chemokine  Taken together with supportive data from the literature  the bioactivities of bailalin may be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment by reducing cytokine-induced acute inflammation  In conclusion  baicalin is potentially a good candidate for developing new therapeutic to treat COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934765

7621,INTRODUCTION  The major burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has been mainly on healthcare workers  HCWs  and as a result many of them have been afflicted with the disease thus far  PURPOSE  The present study was an effort to investigate Tehran University of Medical Sciences HCWs  experiences of COVID-19 during the pandemic in Tehran  Iran  METHODS  This study is essentially a conventional qualitative content analysis  Twenty-six HCWs  including 7 physicians  16 nurses  and 3 physiotherapists  were purposefully selected to participate in the study  The data were collected from April 2020 to January 2021 through semi-structured face-to-face interviews  The interviews were transcribed and then analyzed based on the Graneheim and Lundman method using MAXQDA 12  RESULTS  Based on the qualitative content analysis which resulted in 364 initial codes  three themes and eight subthemes were extracted  The extracted themes were  support    control   and  improvement   CONCLUSIONS  HCWs are in close contact with COVID-19 patients as part of their professional careers and the provision of quality patient care in times of crises is unattainable unless HCWs enjoy support and their own health is maintained  Making institutional  national  and international preparations for their protection is an obligation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889047
9051,Purpose  The key preventive measures adopted to minimise the spread of the coronavirus disease  COVID-19  had significant health  economic and physical impacts mostly in developing countries  This study evaluated the health  economic and physical impacts of COVID-19 lockdown measures among sub-Saharan African  SSA  population and associated demographic variations  Methods  A total of 1970 respondents took part in this web-based cross-sectional survey during the mandatory lockdown period in most SSA  The dependent variables were health  COVID-19 infection  hospitalisation   socioeconomic  lost job  closed down business  and physical impacts  separated from family  of COVID-19  Univariate and bivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors associated with each of the dependent variables by the four sub-regions  Southern  Western  Central and East Africa   Results  The respondents were aged 34 1   - 11 5 years  range  18-75 years  and mostly men  1099  55    25 9   n   511  reported an impact of COVID-19 pandemic with significant regional variations  p < 0 0005  higher proportion were East 36 2  and Southern Africans 30 3   but no gender  p   0 334  and age group variations  p > 0 05   Among Central African respondents  more men than women lost their businesses  45 7  versus 14 3   p   0 002  and contracted COVID-19 infections  40 0  versus 18 2   p   0 024  during the study period  Multivariable analysis revealed that respondents from East  adjusted odds ratio  AOR  1 95  95  confidence interval  CI   1 42-2 69   Southern  AOR 1 46  95  CI  1 09-1 96  and Central Africa  AOR 1 47  95  CI  1 06-2 03  reported significantly higher impact of COVID-19  Those who reported family separation during the lockdown were more likely to be older participants  39-48 years  AOR 2 48  95  CI  1 11-5 57   Conclusion  One in four SSA respondents  mostly East and Southern Africans  were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic during the lockdown  Interventions in high-risk populations are needed to reduce the health  socioeconomic and gender disparities in the impacts of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866949
8250,The rapid and unexpected spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has caused unprecedented disruption to daily life and has brought forward critical challenges for public health  The disease was the largest cause of death in the United States in early 2021  Likewise  the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate diagnoses at scales larger than ever before  To improve the availability of current gold standard diagnostic testing methods  the development of point-of-care devices that can maintain gold standard sensitivity while reducing the cost and providing portability is much needed  In this work  we combine the amplification capabilities of reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification  RT-LAMP  techniques with high-sensitivity end-point detection of crumpled graphene field-effect transistors  cgFETs  to develop a portable detection cell  This electrical detection method takes advantage of the ability of graphene to adsorb single-stranded DNA due to noncovalent pi-pi bonds but not double-stranded DNA  These devices have demonstrated the ability to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a range from 10 to 10 4  copies muL in 20 viral transport medium  VTM  clinical samples  As a result  we achieved 100  PPV  NPV  sensitivity  and specificity with 10 positive and 10 negative VTM clinical samples  Further  the cgFET devices can differentiate between positive and negative VTM clinical samples in 35 min based on the Dirac point shift  Likewise  the improved sensing capabilities of the crumpled gFET were compared with those of the traditional flat gFET devices,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878775
2929,Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide  This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic  Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data  n   735  collected in 2017-2020 on the Finnish population  Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data  n   840  collected in 2019-2021 representing the Finnish working population  We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis  A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic  Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic  Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic  psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population  Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic  but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals  The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic  Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959045
4353,Chemical methods of virus inactivation are used routinely to prevent viral transmission in both a personal hygiene capacity but also in at-risk environments like hospitals  Several virucidal products exist  including hand soaps  gels  and surface disinfectants  Resin acids  which can be derived from tall oil  produced from trees  have been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity  However  whether these products or their derivatives have virucidal activity is unknown  Here  we assessed the capacity of rosin soap to inactivate a panel of pathogenic mammalian viruses in vitro  We show that rosin soap can inactivate human enveloped viruses  influenza A virus  IAV   respiratory syncytial virus  and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   For IAV  rosin soap could provide a 100 000-fold reduction in infectivity  However  rosin soap failed to affect the nonenveloped encephalomyocarditis virus  EMCV   The inhibitory effect of rosin soap against IAV infectivity was dependent on its concentration but not on the incubation time or temperature  In all  we demonstrate a novel chemical inactivation method against enveloped viruses  which could be of use for preventing virus infections in certain settings  IMPORTANCE Viruses remain a significant cause of human disease and death  most notably illustrated through the current coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  Control of virus infection continues to pose a significant global health challenge to the human population  Viruses can spread through multiple routes  including via environmental and surface contamination  where viruses can remain infectious for days  Methods for inactivating viruses on such surfaces may help mitigate infection  Here  we present evidence identifying a novel virucidal product  rosin soap  which is produced from tall oil from coniferous trees  Rosin soap was able to rapidly and potently inactivate influenza virus and other enveloped viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935417

733,BACKGROUND  Despite generally high coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccination rates in the UK  vaccination hesitancy and lower take-up rates have been reported in certain ethnic minority communities  METHODS  We used vaccination data from the National Immunisation Management System  NIMS  linked to the 2011 Census and individual health records for subjects aged >  40 years  n   24 094 186   We estimated age-standardized vaccination rates  stratified by ethnic group and key sociodemographic characteristics  such as religious affiliation  deprivation  educational attainment  geography  living conditions  country of birth  language skills and health status  To understand the association of ethnicity with lower vaccination rates  we conducted a logistic regression model adjusting for differences in geographic  sociodemographic and health characteristics  ResultsAll ethnic groups had lower age-standardized rates of vaccination compared with the white British population  whose vaccination rate of at least one dose was 94   95  CI  94 -94    Black communities had the lowest rates  with 75   74-75   of black African and 66   66-67   of black Caribbean individuals having received at least one dose  The drivers of these lower rates were partly explained by accounting for sociodemographic differences  However  modelled estimates showed significant differences remained for all minority ethnic groups  compared with white British individuals  CONCLUSIONS  Lower COVID-19 vaccination rates are consistently observed amongst all ethnic minorities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994801
9494,BACKGROUND  During the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  patients with confirmed cases in New York State accounted for roughly 25  of total US cases  with psychiatric hospital in-patients at particularly high risk for COVID-19 infection  AIMS  The beneficial effects of mental health medications  such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  SSRIs   on the severity of COVID-19 disease outcomes have been documented  Protective effects against infection have also been suggested for these medications  We therefore tested the hypothesis that medication use modifies the risk of COVID-19 infection in a long-stay  chronic in-patient psychiatry setting  where the potential for exposure was likely uniform across the facility  and where these medications were routinely prescribed  METHOD  This was a retrospective cohort study of an adult psychiatric facility operated by the New York State Office of Mental Health  Current medication information and COVID-19 status was collected from electronic medical records for 165 people who were in-patients during the period January to July 2020  and logistic regression was employed to model the main effects of medication use on COVID-19 infection  RESULTS  A significant protective association was observed between antidepressant use and COVID-19 infection  odds ratio  OR    0 33  95  CI 0 15-0 70  adjusted P < 0 05   Analysis of individual antidepressant classes showed that SSRI  serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and the serotonin-2 antagonist reuptake inhibitor classes of antidepressants  drove this protective effect  Exploratory analyses of individual antidepressants demonstrated an association between lower risk of infection and fluoxetine use  P   0 023   as well as trazodone use  P   0 001   CONCLUSIONS  The novel finding of reduced COVID-19 infection risk for psychiatric in-patients taking antidepressants  suggests that antidepressants may be an important weapon in the continued fight against COVID-19 disease  This finding may become particularly salient for in-patient settings if vaccine-resistant strains of the virus appear,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859759
4438,Patients with immunodeficiency are at an increased risk of recurrent COVID-19 infection  They may lack the natural immune response that usually confers long-lasting immunity  Here  we present our experience managing one such patient  who had a COVID-19 infection twice  5 months apart  He had a positive SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  and computed tomography  CT  thorax with classical findings of COVID-19 on both occasions  He had multiple negative RT-PCR tests and two CT scans without COVID-19 features between these two infections  While the antibody response to the first infection was not detectable  the response to the second infection was robust  Live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated in patients with immunodeficiency  and other vaccines may not elicit an adequate immune response  A high index of suspicion for recurrent COVID-19 is warranted in this group of patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934508
486,OBJECTIVES  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  entry into the host cells depends on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  and transmembrane protease serine 2  TMPRSS2   We investigated the distribution of ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells in various oral tissues to identify the underlying mechanism of oral manifestations in patients with coronavirus disease 2019  Subjects We analysed the expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the oral mucosa  tongue  palate  and buccal mucosa   trigeminal ganglion  vessels  and salivary glands of 9 Sprague-Dawley rats using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence  RESULTS  ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were strongly expressed in the intermediate layer of the squamous epithelia of tongue papillae and buccal mucosa  ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells were observed in the taste buds of the tongue  Additionally  ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in the ductal epithelium and acinar cells of salivary glands  Furthermore  both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were stained in the neuronal cell body of trigeminal ganglia  but not in Schwann cells  Moreover  ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in capillaries  but not in venules arterioles  CONCLUSIONS  SARS-CoV-2 can spread the suprabasal area of squamous epithelia of the oral mucosa  invades taste bud  trigeminal nerve  parotid gland  and microvessel  resulting in oral manifestations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000261
2521,In 2020  the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons and the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended residency programs suspend away rotations and in-person interviews  This study quantifies applicant costs and potential savings in the residency application process resulting from that change  while also evaluating differences in cost with respect to geographic region of the applicant  Methods  A retrospective evaluation of the 2019-2020 Texas STAR  Seeking Transparency in Application to Residency  database was conducted  We queried responses from plastic surgery residency applicants  including expenses associated with the application  away rotations  interviews  and total costs for medical school seniors  Applicant characteristics were recorded  A Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used to evaluate differences in mean costs by medical school region  Results  In total  117 US allopathic applicants to plastic surgery residency were included  Total expenses for the application cycle were  10 845  This was made up of  1638 in application costs   4074 in away rotation costs  and  5486 in interview costs  No significant differences were observed for mean total costs for applicants from schools in the Central   11 045 applicant   Northeast   9696 applicant   South   11 332 applicant   and West   11 205 applicant   P   0 209   Conclusion  Assuming relatively minimal expenditures related to a virtual interview cycle and lack of away rotations in 2021  the average cost savings for plastic surgery residency applicants during the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be over  9000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963875
2013,OBJECTIVES  COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic of the 21st century  The disease can be influenced by various sociodemographic factors and can manifest as clinical  pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms  This study used an artificial neural network  ANN  model with important sociodemographic factors as well as clinical  pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms to screen patients for COVID-19  Patients themselves can screen for these symptoms at home  METHODS  Data on all registered patients were extracted in autumn  The best ANN model was selected from different combinations of connections  some hidden layers and some neurons in each hidden layer  In this study  70  of the data were used in the network training process and the remaining 30  were used to evaluate the function of the multilayer  feed-forward  back-propagation algorithm  RESULTS  The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 were 94 5  and 17 4   In order of priority  clinical symptoms  sociodemographic factors  pulmonary symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were important predictive factors for COVID-19 using the ANN model  Screening patients for COVID-19 using clinical symptoms and sociodemographic factors  80  importance  remains essential  CONCLUSIONS  Home monitoring of oxygen saturation and body temperature as well as old age and drug addiction can be helpful in self-screening symptoms of COVID-19 at home  thereby preventing unnecessary visits to medical centres and reducing burden on medical services,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972690
9351,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that are more resistant to antibody-mediated neutralization pose a new hurdle in combating the COVID-19 pandemic  Although vaccines based on the original Wuhan sequence have been shown to be effective at preventing COVID-19  their efficacy is likely to be decreased against more neutralization-resistant variants-of-concern  VOC   in particular  the Beta variant originating in South Africa  We assessed  in mice  rabbits  and non-human primates  whether a third vaccination with experimental Wuhan-based Spike vaccines could alleviate this problem  Our data show that a third immunization improves neutralizing antibody titers against the variants-of-concern  Alpha  B 1 1 7   Beta  B 1 351   Gamma  P 1   and Delta  B 1 617 2   After three vaccinations  the level of neutralization against Beta was similar to the level of neutralization against the original strain after two vaccinations  suggesting that simply providing a third immunization could nullify the reduced activity of current vaccines against VOC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862406
3784,The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to the healthcare system  but its impact on the transition to same-day discharge shoulder arthroplasty remains unexplored  This study assessed the effect of COVID-19 on length of stay  LOS   same-day discharge rates  and other markers of resource use after elective total shoulder arthroplasty  A total of 508 consecutive patients undergoing elective primary total shoulder arthroplasty between 2019 and 2021 were identified and divided into 2 cohorts   pre-COVID   March 2019-March 2020  n   263  and  post-COVID   May 2020-March 2021  n   245   No elective shoulder arthroplasties were performed at our practice between 18 March and 11 May 2020  Outcome measures included LOS  same-day discharge  discharge location  and 90-day emergency department  ED  visits  readmissions and reoperations  There were no significant differences in baseline preoperative patient characteristics  Shoulder arthroplasty performed post-COVID was associated with a shorter LOS  12 vs  16 h  p   0 017  and a higher rate of same-day discharge  87 3 vs  79 1   p   0 013   The rate of discharge to skilled nursing facilities was similarly low between the groups  1 9 vs  2 0   p   0 915   There was a significant reduction in the rate of 90-day ED visits post-COVID  7 4 vs  13 3   p   0 029   while there were no differences in 90-day reoperation  2 0 vs  1 5   p   0 745  or readmission rates  1 2 vs  1 9   p   0 724   The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have accelerated the shift towards shorter stays and more same-day discharge shoulder arthroplasties  while reducing unexpected acute health needs  e g   ED visits  without adversely affecting readmission and reoperation rates,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945204
9277,Early studies suggest that adults with mental health conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19 infection  severe complications  and higher mortality  yet face barriers in accessing timely health services  Data from the Census Bureau s Household Pulse Survey  a large  nationally representative survey fielded from March 17-29  2021  n   77 104  were analyzed to examine COVID-19 vaccination and intention among adults with mental health symptoms  Separate multivariable regression models were conducted to examine associations between symptoms of anxiety  depression  and anxiety or depression on vaccine receipt  >   1 dose  and intention to be vaccinated  Reasons for not being vaccinated were also assessed  Approximately 35  of adults had symptoms of anxiety or depression  This population was less likely to receive COVID-19 vaccination  adjusted prevalence ratio  aPR    0 94  95 CI  0 91-0 98  but more likely to intend to get a vaccine  aPR   1 13  95 CI  1 08-1 19  than those without these conditions  Females with mental health symptoms were less likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccination but more likely to intend to get vaccinated  while there were fewer significant associations between mental health symptoms and vaccination coverage and intentions to vaccinate among males  Reasons for not getting vaccinated  including concerns about possible vaccine side effects  efficacy  cost  dislike of vaccines  as well as lack of trust in the government and vaccines  were all greater among those with any symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders than those without symptoms  Efforts are needed to increase vaccination uptake and confidence among this vulnerable population by increasing vaccine confidence and addressing concerns about the vaccine,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34863815
5359,BACKGROUND  Patients with severe Coronavirus disease 19  COVID-19  typically require supplemental oxygen as an essential treatment  We developed a machine learning algorithm  based on deep Reinforcement Learning  RL   for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critically ill patients under intensive care  which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice  METHODS  We modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process  Based on individual patient characteristics and health status  an optimal oxygen control policy is learned by using deep deterministic policy gradient  DDPG  and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate  We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021  RESULTS  The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than the standard of care by 2 57   95  CI  2 08-3 06  reduction  P < 0 001  from 7 94  under the standard of care to 5 37  under our proposed algorithm  The averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1 28 L min  95  CI  1 14-1 42  lower than the rate delivered to patients  Thus  the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce the mortality rate  while saving the oxygen scarce resources  It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic  CONCLUSIONS  A personalized reinforcement learning oxygen flow control algorithm for COVID-19 patients under intensive care showed a substantial reduction in 7-day mortality rate as compared to the standard of care  In the overall cross validation cohort independent of the training data  mortality was lowest in patients for whom intensivists  actual flow rate matched the RL decisions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34920724

1002,BACKGROUND  Turnover among frontline healthcare workers  particularly nurses  reached an alarming rate during the COVID-19 pandemic  This turnover has been attributed  in part  to excessive fear of the virus  a condition called coronaphobia   Studies have not yet been conducted examining whether social support and coping skills could act as buffers between coronaphobia and the intention to leave  AIM  To examine the relationship between coronaphobia and frontline nurses  organizational and professional turnover intention and to assess whether social support and coping skills can buffer this relationship  METHODS  A correlational research design was used to collect responses through an online questionnaire from a convenience sample of 687 frontline nurses from the Central Philippines  Data was analysed using descriptive  mean  standard deviation  percentages  and inferential statistics  t - test  Pearson r correlation coefficient  ANOVA  and multiple linear regression   RESULTS  More than half of the frontline nurses experienced coronaphobia  while 25 8  reported a desire to leave their job and 20 7  reported a desire to leave their profession  Coronaphobia had direct significant effects on nurses  organizational  beta  424  p< 001  and professional turnover intention  beta  316  p< 001   Social support and coping skills partially mediated the relationship between organizational  beta  365  p< 001  beta  362  p< 001  and professional turnover intention  beta  279  p< 001  beta  289  p< 001   CONCLUSION  Frontline nurses who experienced coronaphobia were more likely to quit their job and the nursing profession  Increasing nurses  social support and enhancing their coping skills reduced the negative effects of coronaphobia  resulting in improved nurse retention  IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT  Institutional approaches to reduce coronaphobia and turnover intention during the pandemic can be facilitated by improving social support through innovative approaches  e g   use of technology  social media  and equipping nurses with positive coping skills through coping skills training and other empirically based coping skill-building interventions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989437
8983,Since the coronavirus disease outbreak in 2019  several antibody therapeutics have been developed to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infections  Antibody therapeutics are effective in neutralizing the virus and reducing hospitalization in patients with mild and moderate infections  These therapeutics target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2  however  emerging mutations in this protein reduce their efficiency  In this study  we developed a universal SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody  We generated a humanized monoclonal antibody  MG1141A  against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein through traditional mouse immunization  We confirmed that MG1141A could effectively neutralize live viruses  with an EC50 of 92 pM  and that it exhibited effective Fc-mediated functions  Additionally  it retained its neutralizing activity against the alpha  UK   beta  South Africa   and gamma  Brazil  variants of SARS-CoV-2  Taken together  our study contributes to the development of a novel antibody therapeutic approach  which can effectively combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868052
9254,The clathrin coat assembly protein AP180 drives endocytosis  which is crucial for numerous physiological events  such as the internalization and recycling of receptors  uptake of neurotransmitters and entry of viruses  including SARS-CoV-2  by interacting with clathrin  Moreover  dysfunction of AP180 underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease  Therefore  it is important to understand the mechanisms of assembly and  especially  disassembly of AP180 clathrin-containing cages  Here  we identified AP180 as a novel phosphatidic acid  PA -binding protein from the mouse brain  Intriguingly  liposome binding assays using various phospholipids and PA species revealed that AP180 most strongly bound to 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-PA  18 0 22 6-PA  to a comparable extent as phosphatidylinositol 4 5-bisphosphate  PI 4 5 P2   which is known to associate with AP180  An AP180 N-terminal homology domain  1-289 aa  interacted with 18 0 22 6-PA  and a lysine-rich motif  K38-K39-K40  was essential for binding  The 18 0 22 6-PA in liposomes in 100 nm diameter showed strong AP180-binding activity at neutral pH  Notably  18 0 22 6-PA significantly attenuated the interaction of AP180 with clathrin  However  PI 4 5 P2 did not show such an effect  Taken together  these results indicate the novel mechanism by which 18 0 22 6-PA selectively regulates the disassembly of AP180 clathrin-containing cages,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864549
5100,Several mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  have increased the transmission and mortality rate of coronavirus disease-19  COVID-19  across the globe  Although many vaccines have been developed  a large proportion of the global population remains at high risk of infection  The current study aims to develop an antiviral peptide capable of inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its six major variants with the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  receptor  An in-silico approach was employed to design a therapeutic peptide inhibitor against the receptor-binding domain  RBD  of the spike  S  protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants  B 1 1 7  B 1 351  P 1  B 1 617 1  B 1 617 2 and B 1 617 3   The binding specificity and affinity of our designed peptide inhibitor Mod13AApi  YADKYQKQYKDAY  with wild-type S-RBD and its six variants was confirmed by molecular docking using the HPEPDOCK tool  whereas complex stability was determined by the MD simulation study  The physicochemical and ADMET  absorption  distribution  metabolism  excretion  and toxicity  properties of inhibitory peptides were determined using the ExPASy tool and pkCSM server  The docking results and its properties from our in-silico analysis present the Mod13AApi  a promising peptide for the rapid development of anti-coronavirus peptide-based antiviral therapy  Blockage of the binding of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants with ACE2 in the presence of the therapeutic peptide may prevent deadly SARS-CoV-2 variants entry into host cells  Therefore  the designed inhibitory peptide can be utilized as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19  as evident from this in-silico study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924897
5205,This study examines the role of general news media consumption during COVID-19 in aggravating mental health and suicide risk in the US population  In a sample of U S  adults  N   5 010   we investigated how mental health  COVID-19 health beliefs  and general news consumption influenced the odds of suicidal ideation using hierarchical logistic regression models  Both worsening mental health overall and specifically in regard to COVID-19 increased suicidal ideation  Perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection did not increase suicidal ideation  yet higher levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy reduced suicidal ideation  Overall news consumption did not affect suicidal ideation  but media-specific post-hoc analyses revealed that TV news watching decreased suicidal ideation as much as high levels of COVID-19 self-efficacy decreased suicidal ideation  Furthermore  online news consumption increased suicidal ideation as much as worsening mental health overall increased suicidal ideation  Further implications are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923875

4812,BACKGROUND  Viral transmission and disease dynamics of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa are still not well understood  This study aims to provide further insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Malawi by estimating the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hospital-based setting  METHODS  We conducted a hospital-based  convenience sampling  cross-sectional survey for SARS-CoV-2 in Lilongwe  Malawi  Participants answered a questionnaire and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using ELISA and RT-PCR  To estimate immunity  a surrogate virus neutralization test was performed in all seropositive samples  Poisson regression was performed to assess the association of SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence and demographic and behavioral variables  FINDINGS  A total of 930 participants were included in the study  We found a combined point prevalence of 10 1   95  CI 8 4-12 3   Separately analyzed  the RT-PCR positivity was 2 0    95  CI 1 2-3 4   and the seropositivity was 9 3   CI 95  7 6-11 4   Of the tested seropositive samples  90 1   95  CI 81 2 -95 1   were also tested positive in the surrogate virus neutralization assay  We found a high rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection  45 7    SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence was significantly associated with being health care worker  PR 1 7  95  CI 1 1-2 5   INTERPRETATION  Our study suggests that official data underestimate the true magnitude of COVID-19 transmission  Performance of sVNT to estimate immunity in Malawi is feasible and revealed a considerable rate of post-infection immunity in our cohort  Subclinical infection and transmission are probably a game-changer with regards to surveillance  mitigation and vaccination strategies  FUNDING  GIZ German Development and RKI Germany supported this study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929356
1253,Over the past decade  artificial intelligence  AI  and machine learning  ML  have become the breakthrough technology most anticipated to have a transformative effect on pharmaceutical research and development  R D   This is partially driven by revolutionary advances in computational technology and the parallel dissipation of previous constraints to the collection processing of large volumes of data  Meanwhile  the cost of bringing new drugs to market and to patients has become prohibitively expensive  Recognizing these headwinds  AI ML techniques are appealing to the pharmaceutical industry due to their automated nature  predictive capabilities  and the consequent expected increase in efficiency  ML approaches have been used in drug discovery over the past 15-20 years with increasing sophistication  The most recent aspect of drug development where positive disruption from AI ML is starting to occur  is in clinical trial design  conduct  and analysis  The COVID-19 pandemic may further accelerate utilization of AI ML in clinical trials due to an increased reliance on digital technology in clinical trial conduct  As we move towards a world where there is a growing integration of AI ML into R D  it is critical to get past the related buzz-words and noise  It is equally important to recognize that the scientific method is not obsolete when making inferences about data  Doing so will help in separating hope from hype and lead to informed decision-making on the optimal use of AI ML in drug development  This manuscript aims to demystify key concepts  present use-cases and finally offer insights and a balanced view on the optimal use of AI ML methods in R D,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984579
2905,Non-structural protein 1  Nsp1  is a virulence factor found in all beta coronaviruses  b-CoVs   Recent studies have shown that Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with the nuclear export receptor complex  which includes nuclear RNA export factor 1  NXF1  and nuclear transport factor 2-like export factor 1  NXT1   The NXF1-NXT1 complex plays a crucial role in the transport of host messenger RNA  mRNA   Nsp1 interferes with the proper binding of NXF1 to mRNA export adaptors and its docking to the nuclear pore complex  We propose that drugs targeting the binding surface between Nsp1 and NXF1-NXT1 may be a useful strategy to restore host antiviral gene expression  Exploring this strategy forms the main goals of this paper  Crystal structures of Nsp1 and the heterodimer of NXF1-NXT1 have been determined  We modeled the docking of Nsp1 to the NXF1-NXT1 complex  and discovered repurposed drugs that may interfere with this binding  To our knowledge  this is the first attempt at drug-repurposing of this complex  We used structural analysis to screen 1993 FDA-approved drugs for docking to the NXF1-NXT1 complex  The top hit was ganirelix  with a docking score of -14 49  Ganirelix competitively antagonizes the gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor  GNRHR  on pituitary gonadotrophs  and induces rapid  reversible suppression of gonadotropin secretion  The conformations of Nsp1 and GNRHR make it unlikely that they interact with each other  Additional drug leads were inferred from the structural analysis of this complex  which are discussed in the paper  These drugs offer several options for therapeutically blocking Nsp1 binding to NFX1-NXT1  which may normalize nuclear export in COVID-19 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959589
2650,Background  Non-emergent clinical services were limited or suspended during the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic in the United States  U S    This could adversely impact epidemics of public health importance  such as HIV  and access to testing  which is a cornerstone of prevention efforts  Methods  In this observational study  we collected HIV testing and positivity rate clinical data from four geographically diverse U S  healthcare systems in New Orleans  Louisiana  Minneapolis  Minnesota  Providence  Rhode Island  and  Seattle  Washington  Data from 2019 to 2020 were examined to assess changes in HIV testing in community-based  emergency department  and outpatient settings  Poisson regression was used to explore trends in HIV testing through phases of the COVID-19 pandemic  Findings  In outpatient settings  there was a 68-97  reduction in the number of HIV tests per week during each state s stay-at-home order period  compared to during the pre-stay-at-home order period in early 2020  HIV testing remained reduced 11-54  after states transitioned to advisory phases  The HIV positivity rate increased slightly at outpatient settings  except in New Orleans where it fell  Interpretation  We found a concerning trend of substantially decreased HIV testing across four geographically diverse sites  These findings suggest that new HIV infections within the U S  may be undiagnosed and not yet linked to clinical care and services  as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic  Thus  augmented efforts to identify patients and link them to HIV services will be needed as healthcare settings return to full operation  Funding  U S  National Institute of Mental Health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961858

9175,PURPOSE  The goal of this study was to assess if caregivers  attitudes toward the regulatory process of approving the vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  for children aged <12 years changed after a vaccine was approved for adults  METHODS  This was a larger scale COVIPAS  COVID-19 Parental Attitude Study  survey of caregivers presenting with their children aged <  12 years for emergency care in 12 hospitals in the United States  Canada  and Israel  The study compared willingness to support abridged research into COVID-19 vaccines for children between the peak of the pandemic  March-May 2020  and after a COVID-19 vaccine became available for adults  December 2020-March 2021   FINDINGS  A total of 1956 surveys were included in the analyses  Overall  385  30 9   caregivers in the pre-vaccine approval period and 250  35 3   caregivers in the post-adult vaccine phase supported abridged research into COVID-19 vaccines  P < 0 001   In both phases  mothers were less likely to favor abridged approval  Those with children who were fully vaccinated based on the pediatric schedule in their country favored abridged approval in phase 1  odds ratio  1 98  95  confidence interval  1 31-3 08  but less so in phase 2  In both phases  age and concerns of parents that they had COVID-19 or their child had COVID-19 were not associated with changes in response between phases  IMPLICATIONS  Willingness to expedite vaccine approval increased after the emergency approval of COVID-19 vaccine for adults  Mothers are much less likely to approve expedited approval  No significant changes have been found in the composition of caregivers willing to forego regulatory demands on vaccine approval,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865871
239,During the first sequence of lockdowns implemented in many countries around the world in early 2020 as a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic  there was widespread concern amongst many health professionals regarding a predicted rise in alcohol consumption  However  studies have reported diverse findings  with some consumer groups exhibiting an increase and others a decrease in their alcohol purchase and consumption patterns  Although the long-lasting changes in alcohol consumption  if any  are still unknown  the current situation has effectively accelerated a number of pre-existing trends which will likely continue in the future  E-commerce is growing steadily  mainly because of the restrictions within the on-trade channel and concerns around catching COVID-19 amongst consumers  thus lifting traditional barriers to the adoption of digital channels  Premiumization has also grown significantly during the pandemic  especially in the spirits category  due  in part  to the fact that consumers have been increasingly trying to recreate bar and restaurant quality gastronomic experiences in the privacy of their own homes  The trend toward homemade experiences is multi-stakeholder as consumers  retailers  restaurateurs  bar owners  and brands all try to help facilitate at-home consumption experiences  Larger size purchases seem to reflect not only the stockpiling phenomena that occurred during the initial phases of the pandemic but also convenience for consumers  e g   avoiding queues   Additionally  the growing home mixology movement has been observed to result in consumers buying larger amounts of alcohol in order to facilitate cocktail making experimentation at home  It is important to stress  though  that this review was specially focused on available data from the first three quarters of 2020  as an effort to identify and understand the initial impacts the COVID-19 was creating amongst alcohol consumers  It currently remains uncertain how these trends will evolve  and whether or not they will continue post COVID-19  whenever that might be   Key similarities and differences across national markets are highlighted,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003399
6077,Objective  In December 2019  coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  broke out in Wuhan  China  The pandemic has posed a great challenge to radiation oncology departments  as interruptions in radiation therapy  RT  increase the risks of cancer recurrence or failure of the therapy as a whole  This study aimed to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 on radiation therapy staff in China  Methods  As many working staff at different radiation oncology departments in China as possible were retrospectively enrolled from 23 January to 9 March 2020  They were then invited to answer a questionnaire  for essential data collection  from which their basic information  anxiety level  and workload were analyzed  Results  Seven  0 39   of the 1 755 radiation therapy staff who answered the questionnaire had contracted COVID-19  all of whom were from Wuhan  The factors influencing susceptibility were not sex  P   1 000   age  P   0 480   or comorbidities  P   0 600   but geographic location  P < 0 001  and whether the respondent worked in a designated COVID-19 hospital  P   0 003   In terms of protection procedures  four participants carried out basic  one second-level and two third-level protection procedures  The difference was not statistically significant  P   0 720   The infected respondents  anxiety level related to the outbreak  average score 6 57  was higher than that of their counterparts in Wuhan  5 18   as well as across the country  4 79   and 71 43  of those infected expressed the need for psychological interventions  During the epidemic  departments of 428 respondents  24 39   shut down  while 76 71  of the respondents reported workload reduction  Conclusion  The factors related to COVID-19 infection were the geographic location and whether the respondent worked in a designated COVID-19 hospital  The infected respondents experienced greater psychological pressure than their uninfected counterparts and  therefore  required more psychological interventions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909479
2260,The Coronavirus pandemic erupted in 2020 and new graduate registered nurses  RNs  found themselves caring for those with devastating illness as they were transitioning into nursing practice  The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of novice nurses working in acute care settings during a pandemic  This qualitative phenomenological study of novice nurses working in facilities providing acute care for COVID-19 patients was conducted in Phoenix  Arizona  USA  Purposive sampling identified 13 participants for interviews  Data were analyzed using thematic analysis  Eight themes emerged  Dealing with death  Which personal protective equipment  PPE  will keep us safe   Caring for high acuity patients with limited training  Difficulties working short-staffed  Everything is not okay  Support from the healthcare team  Nursing school preparation for a pandemic  I would still choose nursing  Novice nurses felt challenged by the experience and were at times overwhelmed and struggling to cope  Support from peers and coping skills learned during nursing school helped them continue to work during a critical time  Data from this study suggest that some participants may have been experiencing symptoms of anxiety  depression  or post-traumatic stress disorder  and findings provide foundational insights for nursing education and psychological interventions to support the nursing workforce,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968215

7599,The Coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19  pandemic  which started in Wuhan  China in December 2019  has affected the whole world and caused approximately four million deaths  Consequently  scientists have done a great deal of research in such a short time about the disease  Meanwhile  parasites  whose evolutionary process is as old as human history  are often underestimated despite their high prevalence and lethality  Recent studies  however  have shown that immunity changes caused by parasitic infections affect the course of viral diseases  For example  because severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  and Plasmodium use a common CD147 receptor to enter the cell and have similarities in their MHC-presented antigenic determinants  scientists suggest that immunity against parasitic infections protects the body against SARS-CoV-2 infections  This could explain the low COVID-19 incidence in malaria-endemic countries  Additionally  the cytokine storm  which is responsible for mortality in COVID-19 infections  is caused by the activation of the immune system to Th1 way  On the other hand  helminth infections  which activate the immune system to Th2 way  can reduce mortality by preventing the cytokine storm  The relationship between COVID-19 and parasites is not limited to changes in the immune system changes  Studies have shown that the pause in the fight against parasitic infections due to the diversion of all attention toward COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic will lead to an increase in incidences of malaria  leishmaniasis  schistosomiasis  and soil-transmitted helminths  For this reason  efforts to mitigate this increase should be resumed as soon as possible by taking additional measures globally,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889201
3595,The COVID-19 pandemic generated large amounts of stress across the globe  While acute stress negatively impacts health  defining exact consequences and behavioral interventions can be difficult  We hypothesized that a generalized increase in stress and anxiety caused by continuation of the global pandemic would negatively impact sleep quality and that ever users of e-cigarettes and conventional tobacco would have more profound alterations over time  Participants were recruited via social media to complete an online survey in April 2020  n   554   Inhalant use was assessed through the UCSD Inhalant Questionnaire and sleep quality was gauged through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  PSQI   A set of participants  n   217  retook the survey in June 2020  Inhalant users-historical or current e-cigarette vapers  conventional tobacco smokers  and dual users-had higher PSQI scores than never smoker never vapers  demonstrating worse sleep quality in inhalant users  Non-smoking non-vaping subjects who retook the survey in June 2020 had improvement in their PSQI scores by paired t test  indicating better sleep quality as the pandemic continued  while inhalant users of all types had persistently high PSQI scores  poor sleep quality   These data suggest that ever users of tobacco products may be susceptible to overall diminished sleep quality in the setting of stressful life circumstances  These data also suggest that pandemic-initiated lifestyle changes may have led to improvements in sleep quality  Finally  these findings raise concerns for correlations between either past or active e-cigarette use on sleep  and thus overall health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948812
9083,Due to the serious economic losses and deaths caused by COVID-19  the modeling and control of such a pandemic has become a hot research topic  This paper finds an analogy between a polymerization reaction and COVID-19 transmission dynamics  which will provide a novel perspective to optimal control measures  Susceptible individuals  exposed people  infected cases  recovered population  and the dead can be assumed to be specific molecules in the polymerization system  In this paper  a hypothetical polymerization reactor is constructed to describe the transmission of an epidemic  and its kinetic parameters are regressed by the least-squares method  The intensity of social distancing u is considered to the mixing degree of the reaction system  and contact tracing and isolation rho can be regarded as an external circulation in the main reactor to reduce the concentration of active species  Through these analogies  this model can predict the peak infection  deaths  and end time of the epidemic under different control measures to support the decision-making process  Without any measures  u   1 0 and rho   0   more than 90  of the population would be infected  It takes several years to complete herd immunity by nonpharmacological intervention when the proportion of deaths is limited to less than 5   However  vaccination can reduce the time to tens to hundreds of days  which is related to the maximum number of vaccines per day,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866776
8324,Lesch-Nyhan disease  LND  is a rare X-linked inherited neurogenetic disorders of purine metabolic in which the cytoplasmic enzyme  hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  HGprt  is defective  Despite having been characterized over 60 years ago  however  up to now  there is no satisfactory explanation of how deficits in enzyme HGprt can lead to LND with the development of the persistent and severe self-injurious behavior  Recently  a role for epistasis between the mutated hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1  HPRT1  and the beta-amyloid precursor protein  APP  genes affecting the regulation of alternative APP pre-mRNA splicing in LND has been demonstrated  Furthermore  there were also some reported cases of LND developing thrombosis while APP is an important regulator of vein thrombosis and controls coagulation  Otherwise  the surface expression of HGprt enzyme was also observed in several somatic tissue cancers while APP and the APP-like protein-2  APLP2  are deregulated in cancer cells and linked to increased tumor cell proliferation  migration  and invasion  The present review provides a discussion about these findings and suggests a potential molecular link between APP and HGprt via epistasis between HPRT1 and APP genes affecting the regulation of alternative APP pre-mRNA splicing  As a perspective  expression vectors for HGprt enzyme and APP are constructed as described in Ref    24  Nguyen KV  Naviaux RK  Nyhan WL  2020  Lesch-Nyhan disease  I  Construction of expression vectors for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase  HGprt  enzyme and amyloid precursor protein  APP   Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids 39  905-922   and they could be used as tools for clarification of these issues  In addition  these expression vectors  especially the one with the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol  GPI  anchor can be used as a model for the construction of expression vectors for any protein targeting to the cell plasma membrane for studying intermolecular interactions and could be therefore useful in the vaccines as well as antiviral drugs development  studying intermolecular interactions between the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  as well as its variants and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  in coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   43   44   for example,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877405

4023,A novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV-2  emerged towards the end of 2019 that caused a severe respiratory disease in humans called COVID-19  It led to a pandemic with a high rate of morbidity and mortality that is ongoing and threatening humankind  Most of the mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are synonymous or deleterious  but a few of them produce improved viral functions  The first known mutation associated with higher transmissibility  D614G  was detected in early 2020  Since then  the virus has evolved  new mutations have occurred  and many variants have been described  Depending on the genes affected and the location of the mutations  they could provide altered infectivity  transmissibility  or immune escape  To date  mutations that cause variations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been among the most studied because of the protein s role in the initial virus-cell contact and because it is the most variable region in the virus genome  Some concerning mutations associated with an impact on viral fitness have been described in the Spike protein  such as D614G  N501Y  E484K  K417N T  L452R  and P681R  among others  To understand the impact of the infectivity and antigenicity of the virus  the mutation landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has been under constant global scrutiny  The virus variants are defined according to their origin  their genetic profile  some characteristic mutations prevalent in the lineage   and the severity of the disease they produce  which determines the level of concern  If they increase fitness  new variants can outcompete others in the population  The Alpha variant was more transmissible than previous versions and quickly spread globally  The Beta and Gamma variants accumulated mutations that partially escape the immune defenses and affect the effectiveness of vaccines  Nowadays  the Delta variant  identified around March 2021  has spread and displaced the other variants  becoming the most concerning of all lineages that have emerged  The Delta variant has a particular genetic profile  bearing unique mutations  such as T478K in the spike protein and M203R in the nucleocapsid  This review summarizes the current knowledge of the different mutations that have appeared in SARS-CoV-2  mainly on the spike protein  It analyzes their impact on the protein function and  subsequently  on the level of concern of different variants and their importance in the ongoing pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940505
1777,COVID-19 is a pandemic respiratory illness  The disease spreads from human to human and is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  In this study  we formulate a mathematical model of COVID-19 and discuss the disease free state and endemic equilibrium of the model  Based on the sensitivity indexes of the parameters  control strategies are designed  The strategies reduce the densities of the infected classes but do not satisfy the criteria threshold condition of the global stability of disease free equilibrium  On the other hand  the endemic equilibrium of the disease is globally asymptotically stable  Therefore it is concluded that the disease cannot be eradicated with present resources and the human population needs to learn how to live with corona  For validation of the results  numerical simulations are obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976710
2189,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE  The Coronavirus Aid  Relief  and Economic Security Act led to the rapid implementation of telemedicine across health care office settings  Whether this transition to telemedicine has any impact on missed appointments is yet to be determined  This study examined the relationship between telemedicine usage and missed appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic  METHOD  This retrospective study used appointment-level data from 55 Federally Qualified Health Centre clinics in Texas between March and November 2020  To account for the nested data structure of repeated appointments within each patient  a mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine associations between telemedicine use and missed appointments  adjusting for patient sociodemographic characteristics  geographic classification  past medical history  and clinic characteristics  The independent variable was having a telemedicine appointment  defined as an audiovisual consultation started and finalized via a telemedicine platform  The outcome of interest was having a missed appointment  yes no  after a scheduled and confirmed medical appointment  Results from this initial model were stratified by appointment type  in-person vs  telemedicine   RESULTS  The analytic sample included 278 171 appointments for 85 413 unique patients  The overall missed appointment rate was 18   and 25  of all appointments were telemedicine appointments  Compared to in-person visits  telemedicine visits were less likely to result in a missed appointment  OR   0 87  p <  001   Compared to Whites  Asians were less likely to have a missed appointment  OR   0 82  p <  001  while African Americans  Hispanics  and American Indians were all significantly more likely to have missed appointments  OR   1 61  p <  001  OR   1 19  p    01  OR   1 22  p <  01  respectively   Those accessing mental health services  OR   1 57 for in-person and 0 78 for telemedicine  and living in metropolitan areas  OR   1 15 for in-person and 0 82 for telemedicine  were more likely to miss in-person appointments but less likely to miss telemedicine appointments  Patients with frequent medical visits or those living with chronic diseases were more likely to miss in-person appointments but less likely to miss telemedicine appointments  CONCLUSIONS  Telemedicine is strongly associated with fewer missed appointments  Although our findings suggest a residual lag in minority populations  specific patient populations  including those with frequent prior visits or chronic conditions  those seeking mental health services  and those living in metropolitan areas were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments than in-person visits  These findings highlight how telemedicine can enable effective and accessible care by reducing missed healthcare appointments KEY MESSAGESTelemedicine was associated with 13  lower odds of missed appointments Patients with frequent medical visits or those living with chronic diseases were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments Patients seeking mental health services were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments Similarly  those living in metropolitan areas were less likely to miss telemedicine appointments but more likely to miss in-person appointments,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969330
2879,The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent self-isolation exacerbated the problem of insufficient amounts of physical activity and its consequences  At the same time  this revealed the advantage of vitamin D  Thus  there was a need to verify the effects of those forms of training that can be performed independently  In this study  we examined the effects of Nordic walking  NW  and high intensity interval training  HIIT  with regard to the impact of the metabolite vitamin D  We assigned 32 overweight adults  age   61   - 12 years  to one of two training groups  NW   18 and HIIT   14  Body composition assessment and blood sample collection were conducted before starting the training programs and a day after their completion  NW training induced a significant decrease in myostatin  p   0 05  concentration  however  the range was dependent on the baseline concentrations of vitamin D metabolites  This drop was accompanied by a significant negative correlation with the decorin concentration  Unexpectedly  NW caused a decrement in both forms of osteocalcin  undercarboxylated  Glu-OC  and carboxylated-type  Gla-OC   The scope of Glu-OC changes was dependent on a baseline concentration of 25 OH D2  r   -0 60  p   0 01   In contrast  the HIIT protocol did not induce any changes  Overall results revealed that NW diminished the myostatin concentration and that this effect is more pronounced among adults with a sufficient concentration of vitamin D metabolites,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959945
1263,Background  Children are particularly vulnerable to the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic  The disruption in daily life has impacted children significantly  Moreover  the increased worrying associated with the probability of getting infected or becoming seriously unwell due to infection can potentially precipitate anxiety disorders among children  Objective  This study aimed to determine rates of elevated anxiety symptoms in children with COVID-19 infection  It also explored whether there were any differences in terms of age  gender  and residency status  Method  A cross-sectional  questionnaire-based study with 88 participants  children aged 7-13 years  54 5  males  45 5  females  from two institutional quarantine centers  The Spence Children s Anxiety Scale and its validated Arabic version  self-reported questionnaires  were used to measure anxiety symptoms  Results  36 3  children reported elevated anxiety symptoms  A lower rate of 32 8  was reported in younger children  7-11 years  compared to 45 8  in older children  12 and 13 years   70 4  and 57 9  children reported physical injury fears and separation anxiety respectively  A higher prevalence of overall anxiety was reported in children from expatriate families  40 6   compared to native children  25    The difference in the mean scores between the expatriate and native group of children was found statistically significant for obsessive-compulsive symptoms  Conclusions  The prevalence of elevated anxiety symptoms among children in quarantine with COVID-19 infection can be much higher than that reported in the general population  Older children can have elevated anxiety symptoms more commonly than their younger counterparts can  Expatriate children are likely to be more vulnerable to the psychological impact of the pandemic compared to children from local families  Our results suggest the crucial need of focusing on the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on children  The prioritization and effective management of the mental health needs of children should be a vital component of the overall  global response to the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984196
5262,BACKGROUND  Since the COVID-19 outbreak  few studies have investigated the positive psychological consequences on young people  This study examined resilience  positive experiences  and coping strategies reported by Australian adolescents during COVID-19  METHODS  Self-report surveys were administered online to a sample of 760 Australian adolescents aged 12-18 years  Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to assess resilience  positive experiences  and coping strategies  Exploratory regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between resilience and demographics and mental illness history  as well as between resilience and positive experiences  RESULTS  Overall  adolescents were somewhat resilient  M   20 93  SD   8 29   They reported positive experiences during COVID-19  including increased empathy  compassion  gratitude  and connection with others  and reported using a range of active coping strategies  Having a mental illness history and identification as female or non-binary gender were associated with lower resilience  Bs > 2 82  ps < 0 001   Further  resilience was associated with decreased psychological distress  OR   0 89  p < 0 001  and with increased positive experiences  ORs > 1 03  ps < 0 001   CONCLUSIONS  Our results indicate that Australian adolescents commonly reported positive experiences and used active coping strategies during COVID-19  Some young people demonstrated higher levels of resilience and were able to make the most out of an unpredictable situation that severely disrupted their daily routine  However  further prospective research using longitudinal methods is necessary to examine causal relationships between variables  An implication of our findings is that resilience-building programs for adolescents may be effective in increasing adaptability after adversity  e g   climate change  bushfires  pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922575
5447,Continuous rise in the number of COVID-19 cases  since it was first diagnosed in 2019  forced the entire medical fraternity to delay elective surgeries  The preoperative evaluation guidelines that were used in the pre-COVID-19 era underwent significant changes  adding modifications to meet the post-COVID patients  specific criteria and requirements  Currently  all patients before or at the time of hospital admission were tested using a nasopharyngeal swab  by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2  Apart from this  for a patient undergoing elective surgery in their post-COVID-19 period  it is mandatory to obtain a detailed history of COVID-19 disease SARS-CoV-2 infection  to identify residual symptoms or any organ dysfunction the infection might have caused  As well as the functional optimization of the patient to achieve the best clinical and biological status before the surgery  After all the systems have been thoroughly investigated  the risk-benefit ratio needs to be calculated  keeping in mind the cytokine storm and inflammatory responses encountered postoperatively  A mere negative RT-PCR test cannot be considered as the only decisive factor to operate  as the post-COVID-19 phase can influence postoperative outcome of the patient  Hence  the pre-operative evaluation protocols of post-COVID patients should be set and followed thoroughly  in order to avoid post-surgical complications  For better surgical and post-surgical management of post-COVID-19 patients  conducting clinical tests  assessing previously administered medications  evaluating the need for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxes  and identifying subclinical inflammatory state are the measures that should be taken,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919261

7920,Cytokine storm is a phenomenon characterized by strong elevated circulating cytokines that most often occur after an overreactive immune system is activated by an acute systemic infection  A variety of cells participate in cytokine storm induction and progression  with profiles of cytokines released during cytokine storm varying from disease to disease  This review focuses on pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cytokine storm induction and progression induced by pathogenic invasive infectious diseases  Strategies for targeted treatment of various types of infection-induced cytokine storms are described from both host and pathogen perspectives  In summary  current studies indicate that cytokine storm-targeted therapies can effectively alleviate tissue damage while promoting the clearance of invading pathogens  Based on this premise   multi-omics  immune system profiling should facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies to alleviate cytokine storms caused by various diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34884813
4560,The importance of pre-existing immune responses to seasonal endemic coronaviruses  HCoVs  for the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of COVID-19 is the subject of an ongoing scientific debate  Recent studies postulate that immune responses to previous HCoV infections can either have a slightly protective or no effect on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and  consequently  be neglected for COVID-19 risk stratification  Challenging this notion  we provide evidence that pre-existing  anti-nucleocapsid antibodies against endemic alpha-coronaviruses and S2 domain-specific anti-spike antibodies against beta-coronavirus HCoV-OC43 are elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic donors  This finding is particularly pronounced in males and in critically ill patients  Longitudinal evaluation reveals that antibody cross-reactivity or polyclonal stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to be confounders  Thus  specific pre-existing immunity to seasonal coronaviruses may increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and predispose individuals to an adverse COVID-19 outcome  guiding risk management and supporting the development of universal coronavirus vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932974
1018,INTRODUCTION  COVID-19 infection is associated with high mortality among hemodialysis patients  Standard vaccine response is generally lower among these patients  The adequate antibody titer response and the outcome of COVID-19 vaccine responders versus non-responders are unknown  METHODS  Hemodialysis patients on maintenance hemodialysis who have received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine were studied  Antibody response was tested after 14 days of the second dose  LIAISON SARS-CoV2 S1 S2 IgG test by DiaSorin  Italy  was used to assess antibody response  Patients were followed between 3 and 7 months after vaccination for COVID-19 infection  hospitalization and death related to COVID-19  FINDINGS  A total of 138 patients received two doses of Pfizer BNT162B2 vaccine  One hundred and twenty-seven patients had adequate response to the vaccine with IgG level >   15 AU ml versus 11 patients had poor response with IgG level <   15 AU ml  The response was 92   127 138   Patient with history of prior COVID-19 infection had higher antibody titer mean of 339   - 113 versus 157   - 140 for patient with no prior history of COVID-19  Seven patients in both groups had COVID-19 infection post vaccine  Among the responders  five patients had COIVD-19 infection and two were hospitalized  These two patients had lower antibody titer of 23 9 and 75 2 AU ml  In comparison  three patients who were not hospitalized had higher antibody titer 96 3  118  and 319 AU ml  respectively  In the non-responders one patient was hospitalized and one death occurred with rate of infection of 18   DISCUSSION  Seropositive patients with low antibody titer might be associated with worse outcome among responders  The ideal antibody titer level among dialysis patient is not known  Also  prior COVID-19 infection is associated with higher response to vaccine with higher antibody titer  All non-responders did not have prior COVID-19 infection  More research is required to further evaluated protective antibody titer,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989097
1009,Background  The prevalence of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders has significantly increased with the COVID-19 pandemic  In parallel  the pandemic has caused a major shift in delivery of care to telemedicine Purpose  This article aimed to discuss the different advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine for perinatal mental health  Telemedicine has significant benefits for perinatal mental health patients  including increased accessibility to specialized care  direct observation of child-parent interactions in their home environment  and facilitation of collaborative work between obstetrical providers and psychiatrists  Alternatively  telemedicine may impede recovery and contribute to an increase in social isolation  The use of telemedicine by obstetrical care providers may also contribute to a reduction in screening and identification of these disorders Conclusion  A hybrid model of in-person and telemedicine delivery of care may serve as a durable compromise solution for these women and their families,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989294
6182,The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the unprecedented challenge of devising massive vaccination rollouts  toward slowing down and eventually extinguishing the diffusion of the virus  The two-dose vaccination procedure  speed requirements  and the scarcity of doses  suitable spaces  and personnel  make the optimal design of such rollouts a complex problem  Mathematical modeling  which has already proved to be determinant in the early phases of the pandemic  can again be a powerful tool to assist public health authorities in optimally planning the vaccination rollout  Here  we propose a novel epidemic model tailored to COVID-19  which includes the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions and a concurrent two-dose vaccination campaign  Then  we leverage nonlinear model predictive control to devise optimal scheduling of first and second doses  accounting both for the healthcare needs and for the socio-economic costs associated with the epidemics  We calibrate our model to the 2021 COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy  Specifically  once identified the epidemic parameters from officially reported data  we numerically assess the effectiveness of the obtained optimal vaccination rollouts for the two most used vaccines  Determining the optimal vaccination strategy is nontrivial  as it depends on the efficacy and duration of the first-dose partial immunization  whereby the prioritization of first doses and the delay of second doses may be effective for vaccines with sufficiently strong first-dose immunization  Our model and optimization approach provide a flexible tool that can be adopted to help devise the current COVID-19 vaccination campaign  and increase preparedness for future epidemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908815
1146,OBJECTIVE  To assess the rate and factors associated with healthcare personnel  HCP  testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an occupational exposure  DESIGN  Retrospective cohort study  SETTING  Academic medical center with sites in Minnesota  Wisconsin  Arizona  and Florida  SUBJECTS  HCP with a high or medium risk occupational exposure to a patient or other HCP with SARS-CoV-2  METHODS  We reviewed the records of HCP with significant occupational exposures from March 20th  2020 through December 31st  2020  We then performed regression analysis to assess the impact of demographic and occupational variables to assess their impact on the likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2  RESULTS  A total of 2 253 confirmed occupational exposures occurred during the study period  Employees were the source for 57 1  of exposures  Overall  101  4 5   HCP tested positive in the postexposure period  Of these  80 had employee sources of exposure and 21 had patient sources of exposure  The post exposure infection rate was 6 2  when employees were the source  compared to 2 2  with patient sources  In a multivariate analysis  occupational exposure from an employee source had a higher risk of testing positive compared to a patient source  OR 3 22 95  CI  1 72-6 04    Gender  age  high-risk exposure  and HCP role were not associated with increased risk of testing positive  CONCLUSIONS  The risk of acquiring COVID-19 following a significant occupational exposure is relatively low  even in the pre-vaccination era  Exposure to an infectious coworker carries a higher risk than exposure to a patient  Continued vigilance and precautions remain necessary in healthcare settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986906
1082,Background Obsessive-compulsive disorder  OCD  is a common condition that has a significant impact on people s lives  COVID-19 pandemic imposed a challenging situation for the general population with new precautionary measures  All that can have serious implications for those who already have intense concerns about cleanliness and hygiene and those diagnosed with OCD  The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic on the emergence and severity of obsession and compulsion symptoms in Saudi Arabia  Methods This was a cross-sectional study with 1 190 participants who completed an online three-part questionnaire that included sociodemographic data  the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale  Y-BOCS  checklist  and  Y-BOCS  severity scale  On account of the fact that OCD requires a clinical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis  screening positive for OCD was defined based on criteria A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM-5   which is selecting at least one of either obsession or compulsion symptoms or both  Screening positive for obsession was defined as selecting at least one of the obsessional symptoms while screening positive for compulsion was defined as selecting at least one of the compulsion symptoms  Results Overall  OCD screening was positive in 82  of participants  Previous diagnosis of OCD was reported by 2 6   N 36  of the participants and 55 2  of them reported that their symptoms did not change during the pandemic  while 41 1  reported that their symptoms increased  Positive OCD screening was significantly higher in participants who reported previous psychological illness  87 6  vs  80 9    those who followed news related to COVID-19 on a daily basis  88 7  vs  76 1    and participants who had not acquired the infection  82 9   compared to those who were infected with COVID-19  72 3    Conclusion The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on OCD screening and symptoms  New OCD symptoms were reported in a high proportion of the participants  The results of this study can provide guidance for psychiatrists and psychologists in the clinical approach and management of patients with OCD  Further focused research on the factors affecting the emergence or severity of OCD symptoms needs to be conducted in the future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987909

2020,BACKGROUND  The majority of breast cancer patients are severely psychologically affected by breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic procedures  The COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions on public life have additionally caused significant psychological distress for much of the population  It is therefore plausible that breast cancer patients might be particularly susceptible to the additional psychological stress caused by the pandemic  increasing suffering  In this study we therefore aimed to assess the level of psychological distress currently experienced by a defined group of breast cancer patients in our breast cancer centre  compared to distress levels pre-COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  Female breast cancer patients of all ages receiving either adjuvant  neoadjuvant  or palliative therapies were recruited for the study  All patients were screened for current or previous COVID-19 infection  The participants completed a self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire  the Stress and Coping Inventory  SCI   the National Comprehensive Cancer Network R   NCCN R   Distress Thermometer  DT   the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  EORTC  QLQ C30  and the BR23  RESULTS  Eighty-two breast cancer patients were included  Therapy status and social demographic factors did not have a significant effect on the distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic  The results of the DT pre and during COVID-19 pandemic did not differ significantly  Using the self-designed COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire  we detected three distinct subgroups demonstrating different levels of concerns in relation to SARS-CoV-2  The subgroup with the highest levels of concern reported significantly decreased life quality  related parameters and symptoms  CONCLUSIONS  This monocentric study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected psychological health in a subpopulation of breast cancer patients  The application of a self-created  COVID-19 pandemic questionnaire  could potentially be used to help identify breast cancer patients who are susceptible to increased psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic  and therefore may need additional intensive psychological support  TRIAL REGISTRATION  DRKS-ID  DRKS00022507,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972520
8241,The purpose of this analytic essay is to contrast the COVID-19 responses in Cuba and the United States  and to understand the differences in outcomes between the 2 nations  With fundamental differences in health systems structure and organization  as well as in political philosophy and culture  it is not surprising that there are major differences in outcomes  The more coordinated  comprehensive response to COVID-19 in Cuba has resulted in significantly better outcomes compared with the United States  Through July 15  2021  the US cumulative case rate is more than 4 times higher than Cuba s  while the death rate and excess death rate are both approximately 12 times higher in the United States  In addition to the large differences in cumulative case and death rates between United States and Cuba  the COVID-19 pandemic has unmasked serious underlying health inequities in the United States  The vaccine rollout presents its own set of challenges for both countries  and future studies can examine the comparative successes to identify effective strategies for distribution and administration   Am J Public Health  2021 111 12  2186-2193  https   doi org 10 2105 AJPH 2021 306526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878871
9406,Knowing how heavily the body is burdened by SARS-CoV-2 infection is all important to avoid tragic outcomes  This demands fast and convenient assays with minimum requirement for instruments and reagents  Therefore  a short synthetic peptide is developed to perform direct serum assay  using portable hand-held potentiostat  in a reagent-less manner  The target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2   a protein secreted by the body into the blood to restrict viral invasion  Specifically  under electrochemical potential scanning  the peptide can covalently capture ACE2 from the serum  and then form a covalent gel-like 2D protein network with the serum proteins  in an ACE2-specific fashion  This formation of a covalent biosensing complex enables sensitive detection in serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients  The detected serum level of ACE2 can not only serve as an index of viral load  but may also hint at the associated risk of potential male infertility  These results may point to field application of this simple design in the clinical practice in treating COVID-19 in the near future,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861523

7425,Across many parts of the globe  the educational system is under a complete shutdown  falling victim to health-safety concerns of the deadly COVID-19  and Bangladesh is no exception  Reportedly  the Bangladesh government prioritized resuming public universities after bringing all the students under vaccination  However  little is known about students  intention toward the COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh  Under the circumstances  this study attempted to assess the COVID-19 vaccine-related knowledge  perceptions  attitude  and acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine of public university students  Besides  factors affecting the degrees of COVID-19 vaccine-related knowledge  perceptions  attitudes  and vaccine acceptability were also explored  Results from descriptive analyses revealed that most of the respondents showed positive attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccine  while 78  of them found to have adequate knowledge  Nevertheless  37  of students exhibiting negative perceptions about the vaccine raised our concern  However  72 7  of respondents intended to take a COVID-19 vaccine  Outcomes of multinomial logistic model showed that knowledge  perceptions  and attitudes significantly varied across the level of education  residence area  and COVID-19 infection history of the respondents  Further  findings of binary logistic model reported that female students  students of low family income  those free from COVID-19 infection  students having inadequate knowledge  and negative perceptions and attitudes toward the vaccine were susceptible to vaccine hesitancy and resistance  Indeed  our research will assist the authorities in better understanding the students  attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines and in developing appropriate policies for a successful vaccination campaign in Bangladesh and other countries with similar background,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893016
3910,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  is the first target of SARS-CoV-2 and a key functional host receptor through which this virus hooks into and infects human cells  The necessity to block this receptor is one of the essential means to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19  This study was conducted to determine the most eligible natural compound to suppress ACE2 to counterfeit its interaction with the viral infection  To do this  the most known compounds of sixty-six Iraqi medicinal plants were generated and retrieved from PubChem database  After preparing a library for Iraqi medicinal plants  3663 unique ligands  conformers were docked to ACE2 using the GLIDE tool  Results found that twenty-three compounds exhibited the highest binding affinity with ACE2  The druglikeness and toxicity potentials of these compounds were evaluated using SwissADME and Protox servers respectively  Out of these virtually screened twenty-three compounds  epicatechin and kempferol were predicted to exert the highest druglikeness and lowest toxicity potentials  Extended Molecular dynamics  MD  simulations showed that ACE2-epicatechin complex exhibited a slightly higher binding stability than ACE2-kempferol complex  In addition to the well-known ACE2 inhibitors that were identified in previous studies  this study revealed for the first time that epicatechin from Hypericum perforatum provided a better static and dynamic inhibition for ACE2 with highly favourable pharmacokinetic properties than the other known ACE2 inhibiting compounds  This study entailed the ability of epicatechin to be used as a potent natural inhibitor that can be used to block or at least weaken the SARS-CoV-2 entry and its subsequent invasion  In vitro experiments are required to validate epicatechin effectiveness against the activity of the human ACE2 receptor,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942397
9532,Background  Public health measures  such as wearing masks  physical distancing  and isolation  have significantly reduced the spread of the coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19   but the impact of public health measures on other respiratory infectious diseases is unclear  Objective  To assess the correlation between public health measures and the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in China during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  We collected the data from the National Health and Construction Commission in China on the number of patients with six respiratory infectious diseases  measles  tuberculosis  pertussis  scarlet fever  influenza  and mumps  from 2017 to 2020 and assessed the correlation between public health measures and the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases  Finally  we used the data of the six respiratory infectious diseases in 2021 to verify our results  Results  We found public health measures significantly reduced the incidence of measles  p   0 002   tuberculosis  p   0 002   pertussis  p   0 004   scarlet fever  p   0 002   influenza  p   0 034   and mumps  p   0 002  in 2020  and prevented seasonal peaks  Moreover  the effects of public health measures were most marked during the peak seasons for these infections  Of the six respiratory infectious diseases considered  tuberculosis was least affected by public health measures  Conclusion  Public health measures were very effective in reducing the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases  especially when the respiratory infectious diseases would normally have been at their peak,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858936

5794,BACKGROUND  COVID-19  Coronavirus Disease-2019  refers to a mainly respiratory disease  caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus predominantly transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes of eyes  mouth  or nose  The main control measures are physical distancing  use of specific protective devices  hand hygiene and disinfection of environments and tools  During this health emergency  telemedicine and telerehabilitation guaranteed patients to receive continuity of care through a virtual support while maintaining physical distance  AIM  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of telerehabilitation on gross motor skills in children with Cerebral Palsy  CP  during Covid-19 lockdown  DESIGN  observational study  SETTING  Pediatric Outpatient Neurorehabilitation Service  POPULATION  53 children with Cerebral Palsy aged between 6 months and 12 years classified according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System  GMFCS   METHODS  variation on the Gross Motor Function Measure-66  GMFM-66  score calculated before and after the telerehabilitation period was analyzed  RESULTS  after telerehabilitation there was a statistically significant increase in the median value of GMFM scores both on the total sample  from 54 82  to 63 18   p-value 0 000005  and in the subgroups  Specifically  in children classified as level I and II at the GMFCS  this value increased more after the telerehabilitation period  Only the GMFCS level V group did not show statistically significant changes and only in two cases a decrease in the GMFM score after the telerehabilitation phase occurred  CONCLUSIONS  telerehabilitation can be considered an efficient tool that can temporarily replace the in person therapy  It can allow the patient or caregiver to acquire skills in performing home exercises and to integrate and implement activity carried out at the rehabilitation center  CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT  this study shows a positive effect of telerehabilitation on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913329
8611,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   binds to host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2  ACE2  through its spike  S  glycoprotein  which mediates membrane fusion and viral entry  However  the expression of ACE2 is extremely low in a variety of human tissues  especially in the airways  Thus  other coreceptors and or cofactors on the surface of host cells may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection  Here  we identified nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA  MYH9  as an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection of human pulmonary cells by using APEX2 proximity-labeling techniques  Genetic ablation of MYH9 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in wild type  WT  A549 and Calu-3 cells  and overexpression of MYH9 enhanced the pseudovirus infection in WT A549 and H1299 cells  MYH9 was colocalized with the SARS-CoV-2 S and directly interacted with SARS-CoV-2 S through the S2 subunit and S1-NTD  N-terminal domain  by its C-terminal domain  designated as PRA   Further experiments suggested that endosomal or myosin inhibitors effectively block the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into PRA-A549 cells  while transmembrane protease serine 2  TMPRSS2  and cathepsin B and L  CatB L  inhibitors do not  indicating that MYH9 promotes SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis and bypasses TMPRSS2 and CatB L pathway  Finally  we demonstrated that loss of MYH9 reduces authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3  ACE2-A549  and ACE2-H1299 cells  Together  our results suggest that MYH9 is a candidate host factor for SARS-CoV-2  which mediates the virus entering host cells by endocytosis in an ACE2-dependent manner  and may serve as a potential target for future clinical intervention strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873039

4087,BACKGROUND  Androgens facilitate entrance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 into respiratory epithelial cells  and male sex is associated with a higher risk of death from corona virus disease  COVID-19   Androgen deprivation therapy  ADT  could possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes  METHODS  In a case-control study nested in the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden  PCBaSe  RAPID 2019  we evaluated the association between ADT and COVID-19 as registered cause of death in men with prostate cancer  Each case was matched to 50 controls by region  We used conditional logistic regression to adjust for confounders and also evaluated potential impact of residual confounding  RESULTS  We identified 474 men who died from COVID-19 in March-December 2020  In crude analyses  ADT exposure was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death  odds ratio  OR  5 05  95  CI  4 18-6 10   however  the OR was substantially attenuated after adjustment for age  comorbidity  prostate cancer characteristics at diagnosis  recent healthcare use  and indicators of advanced cancer  adjusted OR 1 25  95  CI  0 95-1 65   If adjustment has accounted for at least 85  of confounding  then the true effect could be no more than a 5  reduction of the odds for COVID-19 death  CONCLUSIONS  The increased mortality from COVID-19 in men with prostate cancer treated with ADT was mainly related to high age  comorbidity  and more advanced prostate cancer  There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that ADT is associated with improved COVID-19 outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939533
6199,Aim  The aim was to study the correlates of depression  anxiety  self-esteem  and suicidal ideas in patients of COVID-associated mucormycosis  CAM  and effects of treatment  Materials and Methods  A cross-sectional  analytical study was performed in a tertiary care center in Western Maharashtra  By purposive sampling  34 patients of CAM were included in the study with their informed consent and after obtaining ethical clearance  A self-made questionnaire to include demographic and clinical details was filled  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale  HADS   Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale  RSES   and Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale  SIDAS  were applied after initial diagnosis  The HADS  RSES  and SIDAS were reapplied after their operative treatment  Results  A significant reduction in anxiety and depression scores postoperatively was seen  No significant difference was found in self-esteem or suicidal ideas postoperatively in the study population  However  patients who underwent orbital exenteration showed a significant reduction in level of self-esteem with anxiety and depression postoperatively  No specific correlation was found between the computed tomography score  family history  intensive care unit admission  or orbital exenteration with anxiety  depression  self-esteem  and suicidal ideas  Conclusion  Levels of anxiety and depression in patients of CAM reduced significantly after treatment  but self-esteem worsened in males more than females owing to disfigurement  There is a need of psychological counseling in patients of mucormycosis undergoing a debilitating surgery both pre- and postoperatively for a better outcome and recovery,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908669
7484,This paper presents a trend analysis of the COVID-19 pandemics in Mexico  The studies were run in a subnational basis because they are more useful that way  providing important information about the pandemic to local authorities  Unlike classic approaches in the literature  the trend analysis presented here is not based on the variations in the number of infections along time  but rather on the predicted value of the final number of infections  which is updated every day employing new data  Results for four states and four cities  selected among the most populated in Mexico  are presented  The model was able to suitably fit the local data for the selected regions under evaluation  Moreover  the trend analysis enabled one to assess the accuracy of the forecasts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34891640
6728,Background  Post-intubation cardiac arrest  PICA  is an uncommon complication of intubation  but numbers have risen to over 1 5 times the usual number since the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  Due to expert recommendations  high-dose rocuronium  HDR  has become a commonly used pre-intubation neuromuscular blocking agent  Aim  We conducted this retrospective case-control observational study with the hypothesis that high-dose rocuronium was not associated with higher incidence of PICA  Methods  We included 93 patients who were intubated using the rapid sequence intubation  RSI  technique with rocuronium for acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  due to confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia  admitted from March 2020 to February 2021 to a tertiary care hospital in North Carolina  USA  The patients were grouped based on high  1 5 mg kg of ideal body weight and above  versus low  <1 5 mg kg of ideal body weight  dose rocuronium used for RSI  The differences of the various outcomes between the groups were analyzed  Results  The baseline demographics were similar in both groups except for higher body mass index in high-dose group 39 versus 32  kg m 2    p   0 009  There was a total of six PICA events  6 45    The HDR group had 8 0  of PICA versus 4 7  in the low-dose group  In-hospital mortality was 60 0  in the HDR group versus 72 1  in the low-dose group  Conclusion  The incidence of PICA in COVID-19 patients with ARDS who were intubated using the RSI technique was higher than in the pre-COVID-19 era  Relevance for Patients  The use of high-dose paralytics during invasive ventilation with RSI and their consequences should be explored with the help of large-scale studies  The rate of PICA is still very low  and perhaps  the use of HDR is safe  as suggested by the expert panel,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901517
2286,BACKGROUND  The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has affected many aspects of American life with reported increases in parental anxiety and adverse health outcomes among children  However  it is unknown how family functioning and parental anxiety may be associated with child health outcomes during this pandemic  OBJECTIVES  Explore associations among parental worrying  family functioning  and the health-related quality of life  HRQoL  of middle and high school-aged children in the United States during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic  METHODS  Ninety-three parent-child dyads were recruited via snowball sampling through WhatsApp messenger from December 2020 to February 2021 in this exploratory cross-sectional study  Each family completed a series of self-report measures  including the General Functioning Scale-Family Assessment Device and Worry Domaine Questionnaire for parent respondents and the KIDSCREEN-10 for child respondents  A hierarchical regression analysis was performed to examine effects of parental worrying and family functioning on the HRQoL of middle and high school-aged children  RESULTS  Lower levels of parental worrying and better family functioning predicted better child HRQoL  while parental worrying was associated with worse family functioning  The relationship between family functioning and child HRQoL did not differ by levels of parental worrying  Increased child age and parental education were associated with worse child HRQoL  DISCUSSION  The high socioeconomic status sample reported healthy family functioning during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic  Family functioning appears to improve child HRQoL consistently  even as parental worrying increases or decreases  although increased worrying would likely decrease family functioning and child HRQoL  The inverse relationships of parental educational attainment with family functioning and child HRQoL are surprising  they may be due to pandemic circumstances and the nature of the sample being high socioeconomic status families with middle and high school-aged children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967824
6051,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is the agent causing the COVID-19 pandemic  SARS-CoV-2 B 1 1 7  Alpha   a WHO variant of concern first identified in the United Kingdom in late 2020  contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1 S2 cleavage site  which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin  potentially impacting the viral cell entry  Here  we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B 1 1 7 cell entry  We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B 1 1 7 S1 S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage  Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1  B 1 1 7  or a P681H point mutant  Likewise  we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1 2020 and a B 1 1 7 isolate in cell culture  Our findings suggest that  although the B 1 1 7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1 S2 cleavage  this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909610
4201,Most public health measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic are based on preventing the pathogen spread  and the use of oral antiseptics has been proposed as a strategy to reduce transmission risk  The aim of this manuscript is to test the efficacy of mouthwashes to reduce salivary viral load in vivo  This is a multi-centre  blinded  parallel-group  placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial that tests the effect of four mouthwashes  cetylpyridinium chloride  chlorhexidine  povidone-iodine and hydrogen peroxide  in SARS-CoV-2 salivary load measured by qPCR at baseline and 30  60 and 120 min after the mouthrinse  A fifth group of patients used distilled water mouthrinse as a control  Eighty-four participants were recruited and divided into 12-15 per group  There were no statistically significant changes in salivary viral load after the use of the different mouthwashes  Although oral antiseptics have shown virucidal effects in vitro  our data show that salivary viral load in COVID-19 patients was not affected by the tested treatments  This could reflect that those mouthwashes are not effective in vivo  or that viral particles are not infective but viral RNA is still detected by PCR  Viral infectivity studies after the use of mouthwashes are therefore required    https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04707742   Identifier  NCT04707742,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937855
59,The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  pandemic in 2019 has led to a global health crisis  Mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have impeded the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2  Natural products are important for discovering therapeutics to treat the 2019 coronavirus disease  COVID-19   In the present study  we investigated the antiviral activity of herbal drug extracts from Polygala Root  Areca  and Quercus Bark and natural compounds derived from herbal drug such as baicalin and glabridin  with IC50 values of 9 5 microg ml  1 2 microg ml  5 4 microg ml  8 8 microM  and 2 5 microM  respectively  against SARS CoV-2 infection in vitro  Certain herbal drug extracts and natural compounds were found to inhibit viral RNA levels and infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner  Furthermore  viral protein analyses showed that herbal drug extracts and natural compounds effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in the various entry treatments  Our study revealed that three herbal drugs are good candidates for further in vivo and clinical studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006524
9843,Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with thromboinflammation  involving thrombotic and inflammatory responses  in many COVID-19 patients  In addition  immune dysfunction occurs in patients characterised by T cell exhaustion and severe lymphopenia  We investigated the distribution of phosphatidylserine  PS   a marker of dying cells  activated platelets and platelet-derived microparticles  PMP   during the clinical course of COVID-19  We found an unexpectedly high amount of blood cells loaded with PS    PMPs for weeks after the initial COVID-19 diagnosis  Elevated frequencies of PS    PMP    PBMCs correlated strongly with increasing disease severity  As a marker  PS outperformed established laboratory markers for inflammation  leucocyte composition and coagulation  currently used for COVID-19 clinical scoring  PS    PMPs preferentially bound to CD8    T cells with gene expression signatures of proliferating effector rather than memory T cells  As PS    PMPs carried programmed death-ligand 1  PD-L1   they may affect T cell expansion or function  Our data provide a novel marker for disease severity and show that PS  which can trigger the blood coagulation cascade  the complement system  and inflammation  resides on activated immune cells  Therefore  PS may serve as a beacon to attract thromboinflammatory processes towards lymphocytes and cause immune dysfunction in COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34854246
4681,The SARS-CoV-2 or shortly COVID-19  is a viral disease which causes serious lung fever and hugely impacts different body parts from mild to critical depending on tolerant immune system  As the virus multiplies through human-to-human contact  it has affected our lives in a devastating way  including the vigorous pressure on the public health system  the world economy  education sector  workplaces  and shopping malls  Viral spreading of this virus can only be prevented by early detection of positive cases and to treat infected patients as quickly as possible  As many businesses  banks  gymnasiums  and stores etc   are using temperature screening as the primary step to assess for possible COVID-19 infection  Moreover  the proper hand sanitization is the very effective method to limit the outspread of this virus  This paper proposes the design and development of a fully automated low-cost portable electronic system in the form of a robot named CovBot that can be installed in the above-mentioned places by incorporating the mechanisms to automatically detect the body temperature  store the details directly to cloud so as to get the data latter by the authorities  to control restrict the entry  a hand sanitization dispenser unit  auto alert to refill the sanitizer  a mobile display unit etc  Whole system can be managed by a mobile application  The system is controlled using an Arduino-Uno development board  The mobile and the microcontroller system is wirelessly communicated and that to cloud is done by IoT facility  Once this system is implemented  the primary concern and the initial screening associated to COVID-19 can be fully resolved  Comparing to other systems CovBot is cost effective and can be easily installed and operated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931166
9597,Purpose  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant changes in the way undergraduate medical education is conducted including psychiatry teaching  In view of sparse data on how the perception of the undergraduate educational environment  EE  is affected by the pandemic  we sought to compare the ratings of EE and learning processes  motivation  engagement  equipping  appreciation of psychiatry  between the 2020  during pandemic  and 2019  before pandemic  cohorts of students  and examined how the perception of the EE would influence overall experience within the psychiatry rotation  Patients and Methods  The DREEM  Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure  was administered to fourth-year medical undergraduate students undergoing a psychiatry rotation in 2020 during the pandemic and these ratings were compared with those of the preceding cohort in 2019  Students also completed five additional items evaluating various learning processes and overall rating of the posting  Relationships between the DREEM scores  learning processes  and overall effectiveness of rotation were assessed using correlation and mediational analyses  Results  Altogether  84  response rate 93 3   and 269  response rate 89 7   medical undergraduates participated in the study from 2020 and 2019 cohorts  respectively  The 2020 cohort had higher scores on the total DREEM  p   0 032   academic self-perception DREEM subscale  p   0 002   felt more engaged  p   0 043  and better equipped  p   0 003  compared with the 2019 cohort  Overall  DREEM and subdomain scores correlated significantly with specific learning processes  The direct effect of total DREEM and overall rating of psychiatry posting was significant in mediational analyses  Conclusion  Our results highlighted that students  perception of the EE remained positive during the pandemic and impacts overall experience of the psychiatry posting  Undergraduate psychiatry training should continually seek to enhance the EE so as to optimize learning through better engagement and equipping of the learners even during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858074

7058,This research aims to assess air travelers  concerns affected by the Coronavirus pandemic  expressed in the comments they wrote online  A sample of 639 comments written on the Italian National Consumer Union website and related to the airline industry was assessed through an automated sentiment analysis in this study  The achieved results showed that travelers  concerns were directed mainly towards compensations  cancellations  and COVID-19 and at the same time  they had mixed and unpredictable feelings  This element suggests that consumers may have understood that airline companies are facing unsustainable cash-flow and revenue situations  Moreover  all our hypotheses  grounded on existing literature  were refuted  Accordingly  we argue that the actual context prevents assessments based on previous assumptions  and studies related to the impact of COVID-19 need to be conducted anew,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898789
8061,Importance  There is limited evidence on whether COVID-19 vaccine incentive lotteries help to increase vaccine uptake  Objective  To estimate whether and to what extent statewide implementation of lottery programs is associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake  Design  Setting  and Participants  This cross-sectional study used data from 403714 adults who answered the question   have you received a COVID-19 vaccine   on the Household Pulse Survey  HPS  and state-level daily vaccination rates for 11 states implementing a vaccine lottery program  ie  treated states  and 28 states with no such program  ie  control states   A difference-in-difference  DiD  analysis used responses to the HPS question and compared changes in vaccine uptake between treated and control states  The augmented synthetic control  ASC  analysis compared state-level daily new vaccination rates in treated states with their synthetic versions constructed from a donor pool of control states  Data were analyzed from March 17 to July 5  2021  Exposures  Announcement of the vaccine lottery programs and states implementing such programs  Main Outcomes and Measures  The outcome variable in the DiD analysis was the binary indicator of self-reported vaccination status  In the ASC analysis  it was the state-level daily new first vaccine dose administered per 100000 people  logarithm scale   Results  A total of 403714 individuals  mean  SD  age  52 7  15 7  years  239563  weighted percentage  51 6   women  31746  weighted percentage  11 9   Black  39709  weighted percentage  18 2   Hispanic  334034  weighted percentage  76 4   White  responded to the question in HPS regarding vaccination status  Overall  80949 respondents  weighted percentage  28 1   in the HPS were unvaccinated  A pooled analysis from both methods indicated that the lottery programs were associated with increased vaccinations  The ASC analysis revealed that lottery programs were associated with an increase of 0 208 log points  95  CI  0 004-0 412 log points   implying an average 23 12  increment in the new daily vaccination rate  In state-specific analyses  both methods suggested that the vaccine lottery programs were helpful in Ohio  0 09 log points  P <  001   Maryland  0 26 log points  P <  001   Oregon  0 15 log points  P    002   and Washington  0 37 log points  P <  001  but not in Arkansas  Kentucky  and West Virginia  The ASC analysis found that lottery programs were positively associated with vaccinations in New Mexico  0 32 log points  P <  001  and New York  0 33 log points  P    001   Conclusions and Relevance  The findings of this study suggest that lottery programs may be associated with decreased COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy  but that success might differ across states  The findings could also be useful in the ongoing debate on persuading US residents who are not yet vaccinated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34882179
3973,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the features of preoperative preparation and postoperative outcomes in patients with lung cancer and previous COVID-19 pneumonia  MATERIAL AND METHODS  There were 7 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and previous bilateral viral pneumonia between June 2020 and January 2021  In 3 cases  lung cancer was detected in a hospital for COVID-19 patients  Four patients had persistent structural changes in X-ray images  After appropriate preparation  all patients underwent total resection  RESULTS  At admission  all patients had severe physical and functional exhaustion associated with prolonged hypoxia and adynamia that required preoperative rehabilitation  Considering high risk of thromboembolic complications  we administered anticoagulation throughout the entire perioperative period and after discharge  Surgical treatment included anatomical resection  extended lobectomy   Postoperative complications occurred in 2 cases and were associated with prolonged air discharge through the pleural drainage tube  CONCLUSION  As we study the consequences of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19  it becomes obvious that a new category of patients requiring specific diagnosis and treatment has emerged,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941204
734,Importance  A surge of COVID-19 occurred from March to June 2021  in New Delhi  India  linked to the B 1 617 2  Delta  variant of SARS-CoV-2  COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers  HCWs  starting in January 2021  Objective  To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection  Design  Setting  and Participants  This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi  India  Exposures  Vaccination with 0  1  or 2 doses of BBV152  Main Outcomes and Measures  The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated  with 2 doses and >  15 days after the second dose   partially vaccinated  with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose   or unvaccinated  The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed  and events from March 3  2020  to June 18  2021  were included for analysis  Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios  HRs  were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model  Estimated vaccine effectiveness  1 - adjusted HR  was reported  Results  Among 15244 HCWs who participated in the study  4978  32 7   were diagnosed with COVID-19  The mean  SD  age was 36 6  10 3  years  and 55 0  were male  The reinfection incidence density was 7 26  95  CI  6 09-8 66  per 100 person-years  124 HCWs  2 5    total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk   Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection  HR  0 14  95  CI  0 08-0 23    symptomatic reinfection  HR  0 13  95  CI  0 07-0 24    and asymptomatic reinfection  HR  0 16  95  CI  0 05-0 53   compared with unvaccinated HCWs  Accordingly  among the 3 vaccine categories  reinfection was observed in 60 of 472  12 7   of unvaccinated  incidence density  18 05 per 100 person-years  95  CI  14 02-23 25   39 of 356  11 0   of partially vaccinated  incidence density 15 62 per 100 person-years  95  CI  11 42-21 38   and 17 of 1089  1 6   fully vaccinated  incidence density 2 18 per 100 person-years  95  CI  1 35-3 51  HCWs  The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86   95  CI  77 -92    symptomatic reinfection  87   95  CI  76 -93    and asymptomatic reinfection  84   95  CI  47 -95   among fully vaccinated HCWs  Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection  Conclusions and Relevance  These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule  when the predominant circulating variant was B 1 617 2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994793
36,Hyperactive and damaging inflammation is a hallmark of severe rather than mild Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   To uncover key inflammatory differentiators between severe and mild COVID-19  we applied an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis  We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq datasets with COVID-19 patient samples  one that sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage  BAL  cells and one that sequenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMCs   The combined cell population was then analyzed with a focus on genes associated with disease severity  The immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs  lncRNAs  NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients in multiple cell types  Within those same cell types  the concurrent detection of other severity-associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage  Thus  NEAT1 and MALAT1 are potential components of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 that may provide targets for severity related diagnostic measures or therapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007307
7438,The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis  Mental health is critical in such uncertain situations  particularly when people are required to significantly restrict their movements and change their lifestyles  Under these conditions  many countries have turned to telemedicine to strengthen and expand mental health services  Our research group previously developed a mental illness screening system based on heart rate variability  HRV  analysis  enabling an objective and easy mental health self-check  This screening system cannot be used for telemedicine because it uses electrocardiography  ECG  and contact photoplethysmography  PPG   that are not widely available outside of a clinical setting  The purpose of this study is to enable the extension of the aforementioned system to telemedicine by the application of non-contact PPG using an RGB webcam  also called imaging- photoplethysmography  iPPG   The iPPG measurement errors occur due to changes in the relative position between the camera and the target  and due to changes in light  Conventionally  in image processing  the pixel value of the entire face region is used  We propose skin pixel extraction to eliminate blinks  eye movements  and changes in light and shadow  In signal processing  the green channel signal is conventionally used as a pulse wave owing to the absorption characteristics of blood flow  Taking advantage of the fact that the red and blue channels contain noise  we propose a signal reconstruction method for removing noise and strengthening the signal in the pulse rate variability  PRV  frequency band by weighting the three signals of the RGB camera  We conducted an experiment with 13 healthy subjects  and showed that the PRV index and pulse rate  PR  errors estimated by the proposed method were smaller than those of the conventional method  The correlation coefficients between estimated values by the proposed method and reference values of LF  HF  and PR were 0 86  0 69  and 0 96  respectively,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892718
6903,Green tea is produced from Camellia sinensis  L   buds and leaves that have not gone through the oxidation and withering processes used to produce black and oolong teas  It was originated in China  but its cultivation and production have expanded to other Eastern Asian countries  Several polyphenolic compounds  including flavandiols  flavonols  flavonoids  and phenolic acids  are found in green tea and may constitute greater than 30  of the dry weight  Flavonols  especially catechins  represent the majority of green tea polyphenols  Green tea polyphenolic compounds have been reported to confer several health benefits  This review describes the potential use of green tea polyphenols in the management of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   The immunomodulatory  antibacterial  antioxidant  and anti-inflammatory effects of green tea polyphenols have also been considered in this review  In addition to describing the bioactivities associated with green tea polyphenols  this review discusses the potential delivery of these biomolecules using a nanoparticle drug delivery system  Moreover  the bioavailability and toxicity of green tea polyphenols are also evaluated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899956
7300,BACKGROUND  Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic  the majority of clinical trial activity took place face to face within clinical or research units  The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant shift towards trial delivery without in-person face-to-face contact or  Remote Trial Delivery   The National Institute of Health Research  NIHR  assembled a Remote Trial Delivery Working Group to consider challenges and enablers to this major change in clinical trial delivery and to provide a toolkit for researchers to support the transition to remote delivery  METHODS  The NIHR Remote Trial Delivery Working Group evaluated five key domains of the trial delivery pathway  participant factors  recruitment  intervention delivery  outcome measurement and quality assurance  Independent surveys were disseminated to research professionals  and patients and carers  to ascertain benefits  challenges  pitfalls  enablers and examples of good practice in Remote Trial Delivery  A toolkit was constructed to support researchers  funders and governance structures in moving towards Remote Trial Delivery  The toolkit comprises a website encompassing the key principles of Remote Trial Delivery  and a repository of best practice examples and questions to guide research teams  RESULTS  The patient and carer survey received 47 respondents  34 of whom were patients and 13 of whom were carers  The professional survey had 115 examples of remote trial delivery practice entered from across England  Key potential benefits included broader reach and inclusivity  the ability for standardisation and centralisation  and increased efficiency and patient carer convenience  Challenges included the potential exclusion of participants lacking connectivity or digital skills  the lack of digitally skilled workforce and appropriate infrastructure  and validation requirements  Five key principles of Remote Trial Delivery were proposed  national research standards  inclusivity  validity  cost-effectiveness and evaluation of new methodologies  CONCLUSIONS  The rapid changes towards Remote Trial Delivery catalysed by the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to sustained change in clinical trial delivery  The NIHR Remote Trial Delivery Working Group provide a toolkit for researchers recommending five key principles of Remote Trial Delivery and providing examples of enablers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895305
1743,Background  Workplace violence is a social problem of special interest in both intervention and research  Among the sectors that most perceive this type of violence  health care professionals stand out  The most common type of violence for this professional group is the one perpetrated by the users or patients themselves  It has been reported that one out of every four acts of violence in the workplace occurs in the healthcare setting  Within the health sector  the Mental Health  Emergency and Primary Care services have been widely reported as being among the most vulnerable  with Primary Care being the least addressed of the three  Although the available literature is extensive  there are hardly any studies that explore from a qualitative perspective what are the sources of conflict in this sector from the perspective of the users  the most common being to work with professionals  Objective  The aim of this study is to examine those aspects derived from the organization  the professionals or the users of Primary Care that  from the users  point of view  cause violent situations and how they think these could be avoided  Method  The sample consisted of 80 users of the Primary Care services of the Health Service of Murcia  For data collection  a qualitative study was conducted through 10 focus groups and a subsequent thematic analysis of the data  Results  The results have allowed us to identify that  from an organizational point of view  the uncertainty in waiting times  the need to adapt the telematic or telephone appointment to the different types of users  or the management of emergencies in Primary Care are the aspects that cause most conflicts between users and professionals  In this sense  suggested improvements are aimed at providing information in the mobile application updated on the opening hours or maintaining the telephone appointment for those who need or request it  among many others  As for the professionals  users point out that the medical staff is perceived as distant and sometimes does not provide enough information on the health status of users  Another professional group widely addressed in the focus groups was the administrative staff  being described as lacking in communication skills  assertiveness  or empathy  Users recognize the existence of a demanding aggressive profile among users  who makes instrumental use of violence to achieve privileges over users in general  We have also identified the profile of the user who makes use of Primary Care as a way of socializing or managing conflicts of a socioemotional nature  As proposals for this thematic block  users suggest group therapies  the use of audiovisual material complementary to the information provided by professionals or community interventions in psychoeducation  Conclusion  This study allows to explore conflicts between users and professionals from the Primary Care patients  perspective  Our results are complementary to the available evidence that has used the professional s approach to study the phenomenon of workplace violence  The identification of sources of conflict and the assessment and contribution of users on possible ways of improvement can serve as a basis for the design of prevention and intervention plans to improve the work environment in Primary Care centers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976940

8565,World is fighting one of its greatest battle against COVID-19  a highly infectious disease   leading to death of hundreds of thousands of people around the world  with severe patients requiring artificial breathing  To overcome the shortage of ventilators in medical infrastructure  various low-cost  easy to assemble  portable ventilators have been proposed to fight the ongoing pandemic  These mechanical ventilators are made from components that are generally readily available worldwide  Such components are already associated with day-to-day gadgets or items and which do not require specialized manufacturing processes  Various designs have been proposed  focussing on meeting basic requirements for artificial ventilation to fight the ongoing pandemic  But some people are against the usage of these mechanical ventilators in real-life situations  owing to poor reliability and inability of these designs to meet certain clinical requirements  Each design has its own merits and demerits  which need to be addressed for proper designing  Therefore  this article aims to provide readers an overview of various design parameters that needs to be considered while designing portable ventilators  by systematic analysis from available pool of proposed designs  By going through existing literature  we have recognized multiple factors influencing device performance and how these factors need to be considered for efficient device operation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873565
4762,BACKGROUND  The first analyses of the various consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic show that the risk to nurses  psychological well-being is particularly high  As the pandemic and the demands imposed on nurses are not yet fully understood  there is a need to seek buffering factors to protect nurses  psychological health  In line with the earliest evidence  we hypothesize pandemic-related increases in perceived stress and decreases in the frequency of flow experiences  likewise in satisfaction with work  life  work performance  and well-being  As protective factors while dealing with pandemic-related stress  we suggest an individual s sense of humor and perceived appreciation  METHODS  In June July 2020 - during the first lockdown in Germany - participants completed an online-survey in which they were asked to rate their situation before the pandemic  retrospectively  and during the pandemic  Our sample consisted of 174 registered nurses  161 females  13 males  Mage   40 52   of whom 85 worked as public health nurses and 89 as geriatric nurses  RESULTS  During the pandemic  nurses felt more stressed  had fewer flow experiences  and were less satisfied with their work  life  work-performance  and well-being than before the pandemic  In addition  nurses felt more appreciation from society but less from their patients  Sense of humor and the perceived appreciation of society and patients were confirmed as buffers of negative pandemic-related effects  CONCLUSION  Our study contributes to the so far scarce knowledge on nurses  pandemic-related stress and well-being in combination with their resources  Moreover  we were able to identify sense of humor and appreciation as protective factors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930240
3012,Nasopharyngeal swabs are commonly done in the medical field for a multitude of reasons  and they recently have been an essential component of widespread testing to control the spread of COVID-19  Although rare  improper technique when performing nasopharyngeal swabs has the potential to lead to injury or misleading test results  We present a case of uncontrolled epistaxis requiring hospitalization following a routine nasopharyngeal swab in a healthy patient  Both the complexity and variability of the anatomy of the nasopharynx can contribute to poor swabbing technique  Otolaryngologists should be encouraged to educate and support other healthcare workers to improve the yield and reduce the risk of harm due to nasopharyngeal swabs  Increased comfort levels with performing nasopharyngeal swabs will also improve the sensitivity of screening tests for common respiratory viruses such as influenza  Epstein-Barr virus  EBV   or bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957363

1250,OBJECTIVE  Vaccination is the most efficient way to control the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  but vaccination rates remain below the target level in most countries  This multicenter study aimed to evaluate the vaccination status of hospitalized patients and compare two different booster vaccine protocols  SETTING  Inoculation in Turkey began in mid-January 2021  Sinovac was the only available vaccine until April 2021  when BioNTech was added  At the beginning of July 2021  the government offered a third booster dose to healthcare workers and people aged > 50 years who had received the two doses of Sinovac  Of the participants who received a booster  most chose BioNTech as the third dose  METHODS  We collected data from 25 hospitals in 16 cities  Patients hospitalized between August 1 and 10  2021  were included and categorized into eight groups according to their vaccination status  RESULTS  We identified 1401 patients  of which 529  37 7   were admitted to intensive care units  Nearly half  47 8   of the patients were not vaccinated  and those with two doses of Sinovac formed the second largest group  32 9    Hospitalizations were lower in the group which received 2 doses of Sinovac and a booster dose of BioNTech than in the group which received 3 doses of Sinovac  CONCLUSION  Effective vaccinations decreased COVID-19-related hospitalizations  The efficacy after two doses of Sinovac may decrease over time  however  it may be enhanced by adding a booster dose  Moreover  unvaccinated patients may be persuaded to undergo vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984646
6968,COVID-19 is wreaking havoc all around the globe  and Pakistan bears no exception  This study explores Pakistan s response toward controlling COVID-19 Pandemic from the day the 1st case was reported  February 26  2020  in Pakistan until August 31  2020  It explores the administrative conflicts among federal and provincial governments and political behaviors of political parties toward the COVID-19 pandemic by referring Government Response Index  By applying the ARDL model approach  results show that since the administrative harmony had been implemented in Pakistan in July 2020  its positive impact on combating the COVID-19 situation in Pakistan and substantial improvement in recovered cases and a downward trend new confirmed and fatal cases has observed in Pakistan  The findings demonstrate that administrative efforts scattered due to internal conflicts from February to mid-July 2020 have ended  and collective aggressive policy enforcement has been mitigating the adverse impact of COVID-19 in Pakistan since July to date  However  sustainable measures and prudent policy implications are needed to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future calamities,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899059
3286,In a context of mistrust in public health institutions and practices  anti-COVID vaccination protests and the storming of Congress have illustrated that conspiracy theories are real and immanent threat to health and wellbeing  democracy  and public understanding of science  One manifestation of this is the suggested correlation of COVID-19 with 5G mobile technology  Throughout 2020  this alleged correlation was promoted and distributed widely on social media  often in the form of maps overlaying the distribution of COVID-19 cases with the instillation of 5G towers  These conspiracy theories are not fringe phenomena  and they form part of a growing repertoire for conspiracist activist groups with capacities for organised violence  In this paper  we outline how spatial data have been co-opted  and spatial correlations asserted by conspiracy theorists  We consider the basis of their claims of causal association with reference to three key areas of geographical explanation   1  how social properties are constituted and how they exert complex causal forces   2  the pitfalls of correlation with spatial and ecological data  and  3  the challenges of specifying and interpreting causal effects with spatial data  For each  we consider the unique theoretical and technical challenges involved in specifying meaningful correlation  and how their discarding facilitates conspiracist attribution  In doing so  we offer a basis both to interrogate conspiracists  uses and interpretation of data from elementary principles and offer some cautionary notes on the potential for their future misuse in an age of data democratization  Finally  this paper contributes to work on the basis of conspiracy theories in general  by asserting how - absent an appreciation of these key methodological principles - spatial health data may be especially prone to co-option by conspiracist groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954674

8973,The COVID-19 vaccine is a new vaccine aiming at control of COVID-19 pandemic  This new vaccine is useful for pandemic management  however  an important consideration is on its safety  Thrombosis is a problem might occur after COVID-19 vaccination and the increased blood viscosity is a pathomechanism  Here  the authors estimate on blood viscosity change after COVID-19 vaccination for vaccine recipient with underlying metabolic syndrome  Based on mathematical modelling and simulating technique  the authors estimate the change of blood viscosity after COVID-19 vaccination for persons with underlying metabolic syndrome  According to the estimation  blood viscosity in a healthy person is estimated 2 7 times higher than the normal value while blood viscosity in person with the underlying metabolic syndrome is estimated 2 99 times higher than the normal value  Based on this preliminary report  a more increased blood viscosity level is detected in vaccine recipients with the underlying metabolic syndrome  Monitoring of the blood viscosity problem among a vaccine recipient who has metabolic syndrome is recommended,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34868465
4880,Vaccine hesitancy is considered one of the greatest threats to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccination programs  Lack of trust in vaccine benefits  along with concerns about side effects of the newly developed COVID-19 vaccine  might significantly contribute to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy  The objective of this study was to determine the level of vaccine hesitancy among communities in particular their belief in vaccination benefits and perceived risks of new vaccines  An online cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 countries in Asia  Africa  and South America from February to May 2021  Seven items from the WHO SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Scale were used to measure a construct of belief in vaccination benefit  and one item measured perceived riskiness of new vaccines  A logistic regression was used to determine which sociodemographic factors were associated with both vaccine hesitancy constructs  A total of 1 832 respondents were included in the final analysis of which 36 2   range 5 6-52 2   and 77 6   range 38 3-91 2   of them were classified as vaccine hesitant in terms of beliefs in vaccination benefits and concerns about new vaccines  respectively  Respondents from Pakistan had the highest vaccine hesitancy while those from Chile had the lowest  Being females  Muslim  having a non-healthcare-related job and not receiving a flu vaccination during the past 12 months were associated with poor beliefs of vaccination benefits  Those who were living in rural areas  Muslim  and those who did not received a flu vaccination during the past 12 months had relatively higher beliefs that new vaccines are riskier  High prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in some countries during the COVID-19 pandemic might hamper COVID-19 vaccination programs worldwide  Programs should be developed to promote vaccination in those sociodemographic groups with relatively high vaccine hesitancy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928187
752,The novel coronavirus  SARS-coV-2  which emerged in Wuhan in November 2019  has increasingly spread worldwide  More than 272 million cases of infection have been identified  COVID-19 affects 223 countries and territories across the world  The principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is the lower respiratory tract  Series of moderate to non-specific severe clinical signs and symptoms that appear two to fourteen days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 can occur in patients with COVID-19 disease  There is cough  breath deficiency  and at least two of these symptoms  headache  fever  chills  repeated rigor  myalgia  oropharyngitis  anosmia  and ageusia  No therapeutic agents have been validated to have substantial efficacy in the clinical care of COVID-19 patients in large-scale trials  despite worsening infected rates in COVID-19  Early clinical evidence from many sources suggests that treatment with famotidine may decrease COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality  The mechanism by which famotidine could improve the outcomes of COVID-19 is currently unknown  A more recent postulated mechanism is that the effect of famotidine is mediated by histamine-2 receptor antagonism or inverse agonism  inferring that the SARS-CoV-2  resulting in COVID-19 infection at least partially leads to the abnormal release of histamine and perhaps dysfunction of mast cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34994318
7361,Tocilizumab is one of few treatments that have been shown to improve mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   but increased demand has led to relative global shortages  Recently  it has been suggested that lower doses  or fixed doses  of tocilizumab could be a potential solution to conserve the limited global supply while conferring equivalent therapeutic benefit to the dosing regimens studied in major trials  The relationship between tocilizumab dose  exposure  and response in COVID-19 has not been adequately characterized  There are a number of pharmacokinetic  PK  parameters that likely differ between patients with severe COVID-19 and patients in whom tocilizumab was studied during the US FDA approval process  Likewise  it is unclear whether a threshold exposure is necessary for tocilizumab efficacy  The safety and efficacy of fixed versus weight-based dosing of tocilizumab has been evaluated outside of COVID-19  but it is uncertain if these observations are generalizable to severe or critical COVID-19  In the current review  we consider the potential advantages and limitations of alternative tocilizumab dosing strategies  Leveraging PK models and simulation analyses  we demonstrate that a fixed single dose of tocilizumab 400 mg is unlikely to produce PK exposures equivalent to those achieved in the REMAP-CAP trial  although weight-stratified dosing appears to produce more uniform exposure distribution  Data from current and future trials could provide PK pharmacodynamic insight to better inform dosing strategies at the bedside  Ultimately  rational dosing strategies that balance available limited supply with patient needs are required,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894345

7008,Objectives  The corona virus disease-19  COVID-19  pandemic has affected every domain of human health be it physical or mental  The uncertainty of disease progression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to major psychological and psychiatric concerns that should not be overlooked  The interventions should be directed to the vulnerable population to help them mitigate the stress and anxiety caused by the infection and isolation  We evaluated the effect of meditation and breathing exercises on the well-being of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection under institutional isolation  Materials and Methods  We conducted a randomized control trial on 84 subjects  18 years and above  asymptomatic  or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients under institutional isolation  Subjects were randomly and equally divided into a control group and interventional group  We measured the depression  anxiety  and stress levels as well as quality of sleep in patients after 7 days of meditation and breathing exercises in the intervention group versus standard care in the control group  Results  Meditation and breathing exercises had a statistically significant effect on the depression level  P < 0 001   stress level  P   0 004   and the quality of sleep  trouble falling asleep  P   0 007   trouble staying asleep  P   0 004   and feel tired after waking up in the morning  P   0 003    Further  the positive effect of intervention on the level of anxiety in patients under isolation was also observed  however  the difference was not found to be statistically significant  P   0 528   Conclusion  Meditation and breathing exercises have positive effects on depression  stress levels  and quality of sleep in COVID-19 positive patients under strict institutional isolation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898943
1586,BACKGROUND  The Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has been a great threat to global public health since 2020  Although the advance on vaccine development has been largely achieved  a strategy to alleviate immune overactivation in severe COVID-19 patients is still needed  The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 severity  However  the processes by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in COVID-19 disease remain unclear  METHODS  We infected THP-1 derived macrophages  NLRP3 knockout mice  and human ACE2 transgenic mice with live SARS-CoV-2 in Biosafety Level 3  BSL-3  laboratory  We performed quantitative real-time PCR for targeted viral or host genes from SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse tissues  conducted histological or immunofluorescence analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse tissues  We also injected intranasally AAV-hACE2 or intraperitoneally NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 before SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice as indicated  FINDINGS  We have provided multiple lines of evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the lungs  Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome attenuated the release of COVID-19 related pro-inflammatory cytokines in cell cultures and mice  The severe pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissues was reduced in Nlrp3 - -  mice compared to wild-type C57BL 6 mice  Finally  specific inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 alleviated excessive lung inflammation and thus COVID-19 like pathology in human ACE2 transgenic mice  INTERPRETATION  Inflammatory activation induced by SARS-CoV-2 is an important stimulator of COVID-19 related immunopathology  Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising immune intervention against severe COVID-19 disease  FUNDING  This work was supported by grants from the Bureau of Frontier Sciences and Education  CAS  grant no  QYZDJ-SSW-SMC005 to Y G Y    the key project of the CAS  Light of West China  Program  to D Y   and Yunnan Province  202001AS070023 to D Y,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979342
8343,2020 was an unprecedented year  with rapid and drastic changes in human mobility due to the COVID-19 pandemic  To understand the variation in commuting patterns among the Chinese population across stable and unstable periods  we used nationwide mobility data from 318 million mobile phone users in China to examine the extreme fluctuations of population movements in 2020  ranging from the Lunar New Year travel season  chunyun   to the exceptional calm of COVID-19 lockdown  and then to the recovery period  We observed that cross-city movements  which increased substantially in chunyun and then dropped sharply during the lockdown  are primarily dependent on travel distance and the socio-economic development of cities  Following the Lunar New Year holiday  national mobility remained low until mid-February  and COVID-19 interventions delayed more than 72 89 million people returning to large cities  Mobility network analysis revealed clusters of highly connected cities  conforming to the social-economic division of urban agglomerations in China  While the mass migration back to large cities was delayed  smaller cities connected more densely to form new clusters  During the recovery period after travel restrictions were lifted  the netflows of over 55  city pairs reversed in direction compared to before the lockdown  These findings offer the most comprehensive picture of Chinese mobility at fine resolution across various scenarios in China and are of critical importance for decision making regarding future public-health-emergency response  transportation planning and regional economic development  among others,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876997
1322,BACKGROUND  There is an increasing trend of door locking practices in acute psychiatric care  The aim of the present study was to illuminate the symbolic dimensions of doors in Greek mental health nurses  experiences of open and locked working spaces  RESULTS  A sequential mixed-method designexplored the experiences of nurses working in both open and locked psychiatric acute care units  Participants experiences revealed four types of doors related to the quality of recovery-oriented care   a  the open door   b  the invisible door   c  the restraining door  and  d  the revolving door  Open doors and permeable spacesgenerated trust and facilitated the diffusion of tension and the necessary perception of feeling safe in order to be involved in therapeutic engagement  When the locked unit was experienced as a caring environment  the locked doors appeared to be  invisible   The restraining doors symbolized loss of control  social distance and stigma echoing the consequences of restrictingpeople s crucial control over spaceduring the COVID-19 pandemicin relation toviolence within families  groups and communities  The revolving door  service users  abscondence re-admission  symbolised the rejection of the offered therapeutic environment and was a source of indignation and compassion fatigue in both open and locked spaces attributed to internal structural acute care characteristics  limited staffing levels  support  resources and activities for service users  as well as  locked doors  in the community  limited or no care continuity and stigma   CONCLUSIONS  The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on people s crucial control of space provides an impetus for erecting barriers masked by the veil of habit and reconsidering the impact of the simple act of leaving the door open locked to allow both psychiatric acute care unit staff and service users to reach their potential,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983447
9257,BACKGROUND  COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted stroke care services at multiple levels  There was a decline in acute stroke admissions  Fewer interventions have been performed  Increased  door-to-needle times and  door-to-groin puncture  during this pandemic  These factors combined have led to declining in the favoured outcomes of stroke patients  globally  Yet this pandemic permits an opportunity for higher preparedness for future pandemics  OBJECTIVES AND METHODS  This paper aims to shed light on the main lessons learned in the field of stroke care during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic  Here we are presenting proposals and initiatives for better preparedness in future similar emergencies  These proposals are based primarily on literature review of COVID-19 publications  as well as the first-hand experience gained during the first wave at the regional level  In addition to the consensus and collective ride of stroke experts in the Middle East North Africa Stroke and Interventional Neurotherapies Organization  MENA -SINO  and interaction and collaboration with international stroke specialists from the Stroke World Organization  WSO   European Stroke Organization  ESO  and stroke and COVID-19 papers authors  CONCLUSION  Stroke care is very complex  particularly in the initial hours after onset of symptoms  A successful outcome requires very close collaboration between clinical personnel from multiple specialties  Preparedness for future pandemics requires the improvement of care plans that allow for rapid assessment of stroke patients and ensuring that regular  mock exercises  familiarize quintessential services that care for the stroke patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34864375
9832,BACKGROUND  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is still continuing worldwide  Currently  two mRNA-based vaccines and two DNA vaccines using an adenovirus vector are representative vaccines  Since the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines began to be administered  a significant decrease in new infections and COVID-19-associated death has been reported  However  various adverse events from mild symptoms to death have also been described after vaccination  CASE DESCRIPTION  Patients with high fever and lymphadenopathy who are diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  HLH  after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare  and there is no standard management guideline for these patients thus far  Herein  we described two cases of HLH after the administration of an mRNA-based vaccine and adenovirus vector vaccine  DISCUSSION  HLH is a life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndrome that occurs due to persistent stimulation of lymphocytes and histiocytes in various underlying conditions at all ages  Although the exact mechanisms and risk factors of COVID-19 vaccination-related HLH are still unknown  vigorous immune stimulation may trigger a huge cytokine storm  rarely resulting in HLH  It is important to note that early suspicion by clinicians can lower the mortality rate,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34854350
1470,The Omicron SARS-CoV-2 virus contains extensive sequence changes relative to the earlier arising B 1  B 1 1 and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants that have unknown effects on viral infectivity and response to existing vaccines  Using SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles  SC2-VLPs   we examined mutations in all four structural proteins and found that Omicron showed increased infectivity relative to B 1  B 1 1 and similar to Delta  a property conferred by S and N protein mutations  Thirty-eight antisera samples from individuals vaccinated with tozinameran  Pfizer BioNTech   elasomeran  Moderna   Johnson   Johnson vaccines and convalescent sera from unvaccinated COVID-19 survivors had moderately to dramatically reduced efficacy to prevent cell transduction by VLPs containing the Omicron mutations  The Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna vaccine antisera showed strong neutralizing activity against VLPs possessing the ancestral spike protein  B 1  B 1 1   with 3-fold reduced efficacy against Delta and 15-fold lower neutralization against Omicron VLPs  Johnson   Johnson antisera showed minimal neutralization of any of the VLPs tested  Furthermore  the monoclonal antibody therapeutics Casirivimab and Imdevimab had robust neutralization activity against B 1  B 1 1 or Delta VLPs but no detectable neutralization of Omicron VLPs  Our results suggest that Omicron is at least as efficient at assembly and cell entry as Delta  and the antibody response triggered by existing vaccines or previous infection  at least prior to boost  will have limited ability to neutralize Omicron  In addition  some currently available monoclonal antibodies will not be useful in treating Omicron-infected patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981067
5006,The Novel Corona Virus 2019 has drastically affected millions of people all around the world and was a huge threat to the human race since its evolution in 2019  Chest CT images are considered to be one of the indicative sources for diagnosis of COVID-19 by most of the researchers in the research community  Several researchers have proposed various models for the prediction of Covid- 19 using CT images using Artificial Intelligence based algorithms  19    20    21   EfficientNet is one of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network models proposed by Mingxing Tan and Quoc  18   The objective of this study is to explore the effect of image enhancement algorithms such as Laplace transform  Wavelet transforms  Adaptive gamma correction and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization  CLAHE  on Chest CT images for the classification of Covid-19 using the EfficientNet algorithm  SARS- COV-2 14  dataset is used in this study  The images were preprocessed and brightness augmented  The EfficientNet algorithm is implemented and the performance is evaluated by adding the four image enhancement algorithms  The CLAHE based EfficientNet model yielded an accuracy of 94 56   precision of 95   recall of 91   and F1 of 93   This study shows that adding a CLAHE image enhancement to the EfficientNet model improves the performance of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network model in classifying the CT images for Covid-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926175
8591,The early diagnosis and the accurate separation of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases based on pulmonary diffuse airspace opacities is one of the challenges facing researchers  Recently  researchers try to exploit the Deep Learning  DL  method s capability to assist clinicians and radiologists in diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images  In this approach  DL models  especially Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  DCNN   propose real-time  automated effective models to detect COVID-19 cases  However  conventional DCNNs usually use Gradient Descent-based approaches for training fully connected layers  Although GD-based Training  GBT  methods are easy to implement and fast in the process  they demand numerous manual parameter tuning to make them optimal  Besides  the GBT s procedure is inherently sequential  thereby parallelizing them with Graphics Processing Units is very difficult  Therefore  for the sake of having a real-time COVID-19 detector with parallel implementation capability  this paper proposes the use of the Whale Optimization Algorithm for training fully connected layers  The designed detector is then benchmarked on a verified dataset called COVID-Xray-5k  and the results are verified by a comparative study with classic DCNN  DUICM  and Matched Subspace classifier with Adaptive Dictionaries  The results show that the proposed model with an average accuracy of 99 06  provides 1 87  better performance than the best comparison model  The paper also considers the concept of Class Activation Map to detect the regions potentially infected by the virus  This was found to correlate with clinical results  as confirmed by experts  Although results are auspicious  further investigation is needed on a larger dataset of COVID-19 images to have a more comprehensive evaluation of accuracy rates,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873379
8687,BACKGROUND  In estimating the global burden of cancer  adolescents and young adults with cancer are often overlooked  despite being a distinct subgroup with unique epidemiology  clinical care needs  and societal impact  Comprehensive estimates of the global cancer burden in adolescents and young adults  aged 15-39 years  are lacking  To address this gap  we analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases  Injuries  and Risk Factors Study  GBD  2019  with a focus on the outcome of disability-adjusted life-years  DALYs   to inform global cancer control measures in adolescents and young adults  METHODS  Using the GBD 2019 methodology  international mortality data were collected from vital registration systems  verbal autopsies  and population-based cancer registry inputs modelled with mortality-to-incidence ratios  MIRs   Incidence was computed with mortality estimates and corresponding MIRs  Prevalence estimates were calculated using modelled survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with disability  YLDs   Years of life lost  YLLs  were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death  The main outcome was DALYs  the sum of YLLs and YLDs   Estimates were presented globally and by Socio-demographic Index  SDI  quintiles  countries ranked and divided into five equal SDI groups   and all estimates were presented with corresponding 95  uncertainty intervals  UIs   For this analysis  we used the age range of 15-39 years to define adolescents and young adults  FINDINGS  There were 1 19 million  95  UI 1 11-1 28  incident cancer cases and 396 000  370 000-425 000  deaths due to cancer among people aged 15-39 years worldwide in 2019  The highest age-standardised incidence rates occurred in high SDI  59 6  54 5-65 7  per 100 000 person-years  and high-middle SDI countries  53 2  48 8-57 9  per 100 000 person-years   while the highest age-standardised mortality rates were in low-middle SDI  14 2  12 9-15 6  per 100 000 person-years  and middle SDI  13 6  12 6-14 8  per 100 000 person-years  countries  In 2019  adolescent and young adult cancers contributed 23 5 million  21 9-25 2  DALYs to the global burden of disease  of which 2 7   1 9-3 6  came from YLDs and 97 3   96 4-98 1  from YLLs  Cancer was the fourth leading cause of death and tenth leading cause of DALYs in adolescents and young adults globally  INTERPRETATION  Adolescent and young adult cancers contributed substantially to the overall adolescent and young adult disease burden globally in 2019  These results provide new insights into the distribution and magnitude of the adolescent and young adult cancer burden around the world  With notable differences observed across SDI settings  these estimates can inform global and country-level cancer control efforts  FUNDING  Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities  St Baldrick s Foundation  and the National Cancer Institute,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871551
5094,Some first investigations have focused on the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the general mental health after its outbreak in 2020  According to multiple self-reporting surveys  symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression have risen worldwide  Even some studies based on health care records start to be published  providing more objective and statistically reliable results  Additionally  concerns have been raised  to what extend the access to mental health care has been compromised by the COVID-19 outbreak  The aim of this study was to detect changes in prescription trends of common psychotropic medications in the Swedish region of Scania  The monthly dispensed amounts of selected pharmaceuticals were compared from January 2018 until January 2021  regarding the prescription trends before and after the outbreak of COVID-19  Using an interrupted time series analysis for each medication  no general trend changes were observed  On the one hand  a possible deterioration of the general mental health could not be confirmed by these results  On the other hand  the access to mental health care did not seem to be impaired by the pandemic  When interpreting findings related to the COVID-19 pandemic  regional differences and country-specific approaches for coping with the pandemic should be considered  The Swedish population  for instance  never experienced a full  lock-down  and within Sweden the time point of the outbreak waves differed regionally  In general  the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health are still unclear and need to be investigated further in an international comparison,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925084

1833,Background  The recent emergence of COVID-19  rapid worldwide spread  and incomplete knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection have limited development of therapeutic strategies  Our objective was to systematically investigate molecular regulatory mechanisms of COVID-19  using a combination of high throughput RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics and systems biology approaches  Methods  RNA-Seq data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMCs  of healthy persons  mild and severe 17 COVID-19 patients were analyzed to generate a gene expression matrix  Weighted gene co-expression network analysis  WGCNA  was used to identify co-expression modules in healthy samples as a reference set  For differential co-expression network analysis  module preservation and module-trait relationships approaches were used to identify key modules  Then  protein-protein interaction  PPI  networks  based on co-expressed hub genes  were constructed to identify hub genes TFs with the highest information transfer  hub-high traffic genes  within candidate modules  Results  Based on differential co-expression network analysis  connectivity patterns and network density  72   15 of 21  of modules identified in healthy samples were altered by SARS-CoV-2 infection  Therefore  SARS-CoV-2 caused systemic perturbations in host biological gene networks  In functional enrichment analysis  among 15 non-preserved modules and two significant highly-correlated modules  identified by MTRs   9 modules were directly related to the host immune response and COVID-19 immunopathogenesis  Intriguingly  systemic investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified signaling pathways and key genes proteins associated with COVID-19 s main hallmarks  e g   cytokine storm  respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   acute lung injury  ALI   lymphopenia  coagulation disorders  thrombosis  and pregnancy complications  as well as comorbidities associated with COVID-19  e g   asthma  diabetic complications  cardiovascular diseases  CVDs   liver disorders and acute kidney injury  AKI   Topological analysis with betweenness centrality  BC  identified 290 hub-high traffic genes  central in both co-expression and PPI networks  We also identified several transcriptional regulatory factors  including NFKB1  HIF1A  AHR  and TP53  with important immunoregulatory roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection  Moreover  several hub-high traffic genes  including IL6  IL1B  IL10  TNF  SOCS1  SOCS3  ICAM1  PTEN  RHOA  GDI2  SUMO1  CASP1  IRAK3  HSPA5  ADRB2  PRF1  GZMB  OASL  CCL5  HSP90AA1  HSPD1  IFNG  MAPK1  RAB5A  and TNFRSF1A had the highest rates of information transfer in 9 candidate modules and central roles in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis  Conclusion  This study provides comprehensive information on molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions and identifies several hub-high traffic genes as promising therapeutic targets for the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34975885
648,BACKGROUND  Acute pericarditis is a diffuse inflammation of the pericardial sac with many well-defined etiologies  Acute pericarditis as a vaccine-related adverse event is a rare entity  and the association between pericarditis and the immunogenic response to Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccines is still being fully characterized  CASE REPORT  A previously healthy 18-year-old man presented with fever  pleuritic chest pain  and shortness of breath 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of a COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine  The patient was found to have a large pericardial effusion with early tamponade physiology requiring pericardiocentesis  WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS   As COVID-19 vaccination becomes more prevalent globally  physicians should be aware of pericarditis as a rare but potentially serious adverse reaction  Although a direct causal link cannot be demonstrated  we present this case to increase awareness among emergency physicians of pericarditis as a rare  but potentially serious adverse event associated with COVID-19 vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34996671
2812,Zika virus  ZIKV   a mosquito-borne flavivirus  has recently triggered global concern due to severe health complications  In 2015  a large ZIKV outbreak occurred in the Americas and established a link between ZIKV and microcephaly in newborn babies  spontaneous abortion  persistent viremia  and Guillain-Barre syndrome  While antivirals are being developed and prevention strategies focus on vector control  a safe and effective Zika vaccine remains unavailable  Messenger RNA  mRNA  vaccine technology has arisen as a flexible  simplified  and fast vaccine production platform  Here  we report on an mRNA vaccine candidate that encodes the pre-membrane and envelope  prM-E  glycoproteins of ZIKV strain Brazil SPH2015 and is encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles  LNPs   Our ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP vaccine candidate induced antibody responses that protected in AG129 mice deficient in interferon  IFN  alpha beta gamma  IFN-alpha beta gamma  receptors  Notably  a single administration of ZIKV prM-E mRNA-LNP protected against a lethal dose of ZIKV  while a two-dose strategy induced strong protective immunity  E-specific double-positive IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha T-cells were induced in BALB c mice after immunizations with a two-dose strategy  With the success of mRNA vaccine technology in facing the coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic  our data support the development of prM-E RNActive  R   as a promising mRNA vaccine against Zika to counter future epidemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960211
4436,Introduction  Seasonal influenza activity has declined globally since the widespread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  transmission  There has been scarce information to understand the future dynamics of influenza - and under different hypothesis on relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  in particular - after the disruptions to seasonal patterns  Methods  We collected data from public sources in China  the United Kingdom  and the United States  and forecasted the influenza dynamics in the incoming 2021-2022 season under different NPIs  We considered Northern China and Southern China separately  due to the sharp difference in the patterns of seasonal influenza  For the United Kingdom  data were collected for England only  Results  Compared to the epidemics in 2017-2019  longer and blunter influenza outbreaks could occur should NPIs be fully lifted  with percent positivity varying from 10 5 to 18 6 in the studying regions  The rebounds would be smaller if the mask-wearing intervention continued or the international mobility stayed low  but sharper if the mask-wearing intervention was lifted in the middle of influenza season  Further  influenza activity could stay low under a much less stringent mask-wearing intervention coordinated with influenza vaccination  Conclusions  The results added to our understandings of future influenza dynamics after the global decline during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  In light of the uncertainty on the incoming circulation strains and the relatively low negative impacts of mask wearing on society  our findings suggested that wearing mask could be considered as an accompanying mitigation measure in influenza prevention and control  especially for seasons after long periods of low-exposure to influenza viruses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34934512
2173,COVID-19 vaccination has proven to be effective in preventing severe cases  reducing viral load  and transmissibility  The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of vaccination 11 months after implementation on epidemiological indicators and the effective reproduction number in one French region  We plotted four indicators with vaccination coverage as the explaining variable and estimated the impact of vaccination using the reduction rates in infections and hospital admissions  A reduction of 98  in COVID-19-related hospitalisation 11 months after the vaccine campaign began in January 2021 has been reported while vaccine coverage increased over time  Those results do not make it possible to postulate a causal relationship but do support the effect of vaccination against multiple variants of concern  Non-pharmaceutical measures remain necessary to attain complete epidemic control  Open epidemiological data should be considered to monitor vaccine effectiveness wherever possible,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34969543

1310,Recent advances in technology and expanding therapeutic opportunities in neuromuscular disorders has resulted in greater interest in and development of remote assessments  Over the past year  the rapid and abrupt COVID-19 shutdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed challenges to routine clinical management and clinical trials  As in-person services were severely limited  clinicians turned to remote assessments through telehealth to allow for continued care  Typically  disease-specific clinical outcome assessments  COAs  for neuromuscular disorders  NMD  are developed over many years through rigorous and iterative processes to fully understand their psychometric properties  While efforts were underway towards developing remote assessments for NMD before the pandemic  few if any were fully developed or validated  These included assessments of strength  respiratory function and patient-reported outcomes  as well as wearable technology and other devices to quantify physical activity and function  Without many choices  clinicians modified COAs for a virtual environment recognizing it was not yet known how they compared to standard in-person administration  Despite being able to quickly adapt to the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic  these experiences with remote assessments uncovered limitations and opportunities  It became clear that existing COAs required modifications for use in a virtual environment limiting the interpretation of the information gathered  Still  the opportunity for real-world evaluation and reduced patient burden were clear benefits to remote assessment and may provide a more robust understanding and characterization of disease impact in NMD  Hence  we propose a roadmap navigating an informed post-pandemic path toward development and implementation of safe and successful use of remote assessments for patients with NMD,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34983609
5304,Evidence shows that chronic diseases are associated with COVID-19 severity and death  This study aims to estimate the fraction of hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 attributable to chronic diseases associated to poor nutrition and smoking among adults who tested positive to COVID-19 in Mexico  We analyzed 1 006 541 adults aged >  20 who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 23 to December 5  2020  Six chronic diseases were considered  obesity  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   hypertension  diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and chronic kidney disease  CKD   We calibrated the database using a bias quantification method to consider undiagnosed disease cases  To estimate the total impact of multiple diseases  we defined a multimorbidity variable according to the number of diseases  Risks of hospitalization and death were estimated with Poisson regression models and used to calculate population attributable fractions  PAFs   Chronic diseases accounted for to 25 4   95  CI  24 8 -26 1    28 3   95  CI  27 8 -28 7   and 15 3   95  CI  14 9 -15 7   of the hospitalizations among adults below 40  40-59  and 60 years and older  respectively  For COVID-19-related deaths  50 1   95  CI  48 6 -51 5    40 5   95  CI  39 7 -41 3    and 18 7   95  CI  18 0 -19 5   were attributable to chronic diseases in adults under 40  40-59  and 60 years and older  respectively  Chronic diseases linked to poor nutrition and smoking could have contributed to a large burden of hospitalization and deaths from COVID-19 in Mexico  particularly among younger adults  Medical and structural interventions to curb chronic disease incidence and facilitate disease control are urgently needed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921832
3728,Background and Objectives  The COVID-19 pandemic has been shaking lives around the world for nearly two years  The discovery of highly effective vaccines has not been able to stop the transmission of the virus  SARS-CoV-2 shows completely different clinical manifestations  A large percentage  about 40   of admitted patients require treatment in an intensive care unit  ICU   This study investigates the factors associated with admission of COVID-19 patients to the ICU and whether it is possible to obtain a score that can help the emergency physician to select the hospital ward  Materials and Methods  We retrospectively recorded 313 consecutive patients who were presented to the emergency department  ED  of our hospital and had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction  PCR  on an oropharyngeal swab  We used multiple logistic regression to evaluate demographic  clinical  and laboratory data statistically associated with ICU admission  These variables were used to create a prognostic score for ICU admission  Sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive value  PPV   negative predictive value  NPV   and receiver-operating characteristic curve  ROC  of the score for predicting ICU admission during hospitalization were calculated  Results  Of the variables evaluated  only blood type A  p   0 003   PaO2 FiO2  p   0 002   LDH  p   0 004   lactate  p   0 03   dyspnea  p   0 03  and SpO2  p   0 0228  were significantly associated with ICU admission after adjusting for sex  age and comorbidity using multiple logistic regression analysis  We used these variables to create a prognostic score called GOL2DS  group A  PaO2 FiO2  LDH  lactate and dyspnea  and SpO2   which had high accuracy in predicting ICU admission  AUROC 0 830  95  CI  0 791-0 892   Conclusions  In our single-center experience  the GOL2DS score could be useful in identifying patients at high risk for ICU admission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946301
3077,Background  Due to the COVID-19 outbreak  protective measures including alcohol-based hand rub  received unexampled popularity in Iran  Alcohol hand rub is effective  inexpensive and simple to use  but it is a flammable liquid  which might cause burn injuries  In this study  we investigated burn injuries due to alcohol hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 disease outbreak in Iran  Methods  This cross-sectional study was performed on burn patients referred to Motahari Burns and Reconstruction Center from February 20th  2020  official announcement of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran  up to April 19th  2020  All outpatients and hospitalized burn injuries caused by alcohol during the abovementioned period were included  Results  There were 76 burn injuries due to the use of alcohol hand sanitizer  Sixty patients were treated outpatient  and 16 were hospitalized  The mean   - SD age of patients was 33 2  -17 9 years and most were males  57 individuals  75    Also  the mean   - SD of TBSA was 6 1  -6 5   In hospitalized ones  the mean   - SD hospital stay was 11 7  -8 6 days  The most burnt area was the head  39 5   followed by the right upper limb  35 5   and the left upper limb  23 7    Patients were actively engaged in burn injury in 61 8  of cases  while they were passively burnt in 34 2  of cases and in 3 9  the mechanism was unknown  Burn injuries mostly happened in the yard  22 4   followed by the rooftop  21 1   and outdoors  18 4    Conclusion  Appropriate general education  especially through mass media  can reduce burns caused by alcohol-based sanitation during the COVID-19 outbreak  Most of these burn injuries involved face and hands  which are cosmetically and functionally important,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956953
2471,In critically ill patients with sepsis  there is a grave lack of effective treatment options to address the illness-defining inappropriate host response  Currently  treatment is limited to source control and supportive care  albeit with imminent approval of immune modulating drugs for COVID-19-associated lung failure the potential of host-directed strategies appears on the horizon  We suggest expanding the concept of sepsis by incorporating infectious stress within the general stress response of the cell to define sepsis as an illness state characterized by allostatic overload and failing adaptive responses along with biotic  pathogen  and abiotic  e g   malnutrition  environmental stress factors  This would allow conceptualizing the failing organismic responses to pathogens in sepsis with an ancient response pattern depending on the energy state of cells and organs towards other environmental stressors in general  Hence  the present review aims to decipher the heuristic value of a biological definition of sepsis as a failing stress response  These considerations may motivate a better understanding of the processes underlying  host defense failure  on the organismic  organ  cell and molecular levels,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964952
1595,Evidence suggests severe coronavirus disease-19  COVID-19  infection is characterised by pulmonary and systemic microvasculature dysfunction  specifically  acute endothelial injury  hypercoagulation and increased capillary permeability  Diabetes  which is also characterised by vascular injury in itself  confers an increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes  It has been suggested that pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease in diabetes will exacerbate the vascular insults associated with COVID-19 and thus lead to increased severity of COVID-19 infection  In this article  we evaluate the current evidence exploring the impact of microvascular complications  in the form of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy  in individuals with COVID-19 and diabetes  Future insights gained from exploring the microvascular injury patterns and clinical outcomes may come to influence care delivery algorithms for either of these conditions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34979154
5852,Objective  To explore student s perceptions regarding impact of kinesics  facial expressions  gestures  head movements and postures  on undergraduate medical education  Methods  A qualitative exploratory online survey was conducted from July-Sept 2020 among purposively chosen final year BDS students  n 150  of three dental colleges of Islamabad during COVID-19 lockdown phase  Semi-structured survey questions were validated and piloted before execution  Thematic analysis was performed  and consensus was built among all authors regarding findings  hence ensuring analytical triangulation  Results  Response rate was 46   69 150   Twenty sub-themes emerged under three domains of kinesics  Participants told that  neutral expressions  frequently used by teachers create  boring learning environment  and  hesitation among students to ask questions   A smile of teacher imparts  new degree of interest in the subject  and gives  freedom of expression  to the students  On contrary  anger  demotivate  students  instills  fear among them   make them anxious therefore  they are  unable to understand lectures  which ultimately leads to  loss interest in the subject   Use of gestures by teachers creates  enjoyable teaching-learning process  but movements such as clearing throat or shaky legs produce  constant split-second interruption   Moreover  standing posture of teachers bring  interest and alertness among students   Conclusion  Nonverbal communication can have positive or negative impact on undergraduate medical education  Therefore  teachers may start lecture with a smile and anger should be avoided to produce friendly and healthy learning environment  Faculty training is required for the effective use of nonverbal communication strategies to create an optimal learning environment for the students,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34912406

4129,Introduction  During the COVID-19 pandemic  confinement measures are likely to produce collateral damage to health  stress  confusion  anxiety   especially in frail individuals and those living with cardiovascular disease  CVD   In cardiac patients in particular  these measures dramatically increase the level of physical inactivity and sedentary lifestyle  which can decrease cardiorespiratory capacity and increase the risk of acute events  rehospitalization  and depressive syndromes  Maintaining a minimum level of physical activity and cognitive stimulation during the COVID-19 crisis is essential for cardiac patients  This study is designed to document the effects of 6 months of home-based physical exercise alone or combined with cognitive training on cognitive and physical functions in patients with CVD over 50 years old  Methods and Analysis  122 patients  >50 years old  with stable CVD and no contraindication to perform physical exercise training will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the 2 following arms   1  Home-based physical exercise alone   2  Home-based physical exercise combined with cognitive training  The intervention lasts 6 months  with remote assessments performed prior to  mid and post-training  A follow-up 6 months after the end of the intervention  12 month  is also proposed  The primary outcome is cognition  including general functioning  Montreal Cognitive Assessment  MoCA  score   as well as performances on measures of executive functions  processing speed  and episodic memory  The secondary outcome is physical performance  including balance  gait and mobility  leg muscle strength and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness  Tertiary outcomes include mood  anxiety  and health-related quality of life as assessed by self-reported online questionnaires  Discussion  With the COVID-19 crisis  there is a critical need for remote exercise and cognitive training  and to further investigate this topic  in particular for cardiac patients  The present context can be viewed as an opportunity to perform a major shift from center-based programs to home-based physical exercise  This is especially important to reach out to older adults living in remote areas  where access to such interventions is limited  ClinicalTrials gov   https   clinicaltrials gov ct2 show NCT04661189   NCT04661189,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938780
2820,While students in the health sciences occupy pivotal roles in the Moroccan COVID-19 response and vaccination campaigns  factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptability among students have not been reported  This study aimed to determine the willingness and identify predictive attitudes and beliefs of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among health science students in Morocco  A cross-sectional  self-administered online questionnaire was conducted among students of the Mohammed VI University of Health Sciences in Casablanca  Morocco in January 2021  In total  1272 students participated  Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95  confidence intervals  Overall  26 9  of participants reported being willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine  Between genders  male students were more likely to accept the vaccine  Regarding individual attitudes and beliefs about COVID-19 infection  students with greater confidence in COVID-19 information  and higher perceived likelihood and perceived severity of infection were more likely to be willing to get the vaccine  Concerning a COVID-19 vaccine  students who reported lower levels of perceived harm and higher levels of perceived vaccine effectiveness were more willing to get vaccinated  Our findings help guide future efforts to tailor communication and identify strategies to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among students,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960197
3044,The human race has survived many epidemics and pandemics that have emerged and reemerged throughout history  The novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 is the latest pandemic and this has caused major health and socioeconomic problems in almost all communities of the world  The origin of the virus is still in dispute but most likely  the virus emerged from the bats and also may involve an intermediate host before affecting humans  Several other factors also may have affected the emergence and outcome of the infection but in this review  we make a case for a possible role of climate change  The rise in industrialization-related human activities has created a marked imbalance in the homeostasis of environmental factors such as temperature and other weather and these might even have imposed conditions for the emergence of future coronavirus cycles  An attempt is made in this review to explore the effect of ongoing climate changes and discuss if these changes had a role in facilitating the emergence  transmission  and even the expression of the COVID-19 pandemic  We surmise that pandemics will be more frequent in the future and more severely impactful unless climate changes are mitigated,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957147
6161,Objective  Italy faced one of the first large clusters of COVID-19 infections worldwide  Home confinement and social distancing could have negatively impacted sleep habits and prevalence of sleep disorders in children  which may be also linked with altered emotional processes  The present study focused on clinical aspects related to sleep  insomnia and emotions in Italian children aged 0-to-12 years during home confinement due to COVID-19 outbreak  Method  An online survey was systematically distributed in all Italian territories by contacting regional offices of the Italian Ministry of Instruction  University and Research  MIUR  and schools with available contact  All respondents had to be parents of at least one child aged 0 to 12 years old  Information on sociodemographic variables  sleep habits  sleep health behaviors  sleep disorders and mood were collected  Results  Parents of 2361 children  mean age  8 1   - 2 62 years  1148 females  1213 males  answered the survey  1 2  of children was between 0 and 2 years old  15 3  within 3 to 5 years and 83 3  within 6 and 12 years  In all group ages  late bedtime was observed  most of them after 9 p m    59 4  of all children presented at least one clinical diagnostic criterion for childhood insomnia  Logistic regression model showed that presence of at least one criterion for childhood insomnia was associated to younger age  negative mood  current parental insomnia  being the only child  presence of any other sleep disorder  and sleep hygiene behaviors  Conclusions  Data indicate an alarming increase of prevalence of insomnia related problems in Italian children during home confinement with respect to previous data  This was found to be associated with poor sleep hygiene and negative mood  Clinical programs targeting insomnia  sleep health behaviors and emotional processes should be implemented in pediatric primary care in order to prevent the development of sleep problems in a post-pandemic situation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909017
6380,Standing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic  we have faced major medical and economic crisis in recent times which remains to be an unresolved issue till date  Although the scientific community has made significant progress towards diagnosis and understanding the disease  however  effective therapeutics are still lacking  Several omics-based studies  especially proteomics and interactomics  have contributed significantly in terms of identifying biomarker panels that can potentially be used for the disease prognosis  This has also paved the way to identify the targets for drug repurposing as a therapeutic alternative  US Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has set in motion more than 500 drug development programs on an emergency basis  most of them are focusing on repurposed drugs  Remdesivir is one such success of a robust and quick drug repurposing approach  The advancements in omics-based technologies has allowed to explore altered host proteins  which were earlier restricted to only SARS-CoV-2 protein signatures  In this article  we have reviewed major contributions of proteomics and interactomics techniques towards identifying therapeutic targets for COVID-19  Furthermore  in-silico molecular docking approaches to streamline potential drug candidates are also discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34906319

2388,Public awareness of the importance of physical activity has increased due to the many lockdowns imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic  This has brought more widespread attention to a question previously confined primarily to parts of the physical activity promotion community  Do humans have a right to be active  While the public health benefits of physical activity are undisputed  up to now no clear understanding has emerged as to whether physical activity represents a human right  Even though the right to physical activity is not explicitly recognized in international human rights treaties  it seems possible to derive it from well-established human rights such as the right to health  the right to rest and leisure  the right to education  and the principle of nondiscrimination  This paper shows how a right to physical activity could be derived from international human rights treaties  how the attributes of such a right could be defined  and which state obligations would be associated with it  Given that the current human rights discourse in this field focuses mainly on the interconnections between sport and human rights  we would like to argue that there is added value in a debate about physical activity as a human right,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966236

7917,For almost the entire period of the last two decades  translational research in the area of integrin-targeting radiopharmaceuticals was strongly focused on the subtype alphavbeta3  owing to its expression on endothelial cells and its well-established role as a biomarker for  and promoter of  angiogenesis  Despite a large number of translated tracers and clinical studies  a clinical value of alphavbeta3-integrin imaging could not be defined yet  The focus of research has  thus  been moving slowly but steadily towards other integrin subtypes which are involved in a large variety of tumorigenic pathways  Peptidic and non-peptidic radioligands for the integrins alpha5beta1  alphavbeta6  alphavbeta8  alpha6beta1  alpha6beta4  alpha3beta1  alpha4beta1  and alphaMbeta2 were first synthesized and characterized preclinically  Some of these compounds  targeting the subtypes alphavbeta6  alphavbeta8  and alpha6beta1 beta4  were subsequently translated into humans during the last few years  alphavbeta6-Integrin has arguably attracted most attention because it is expressed by some of the cancers with the worst prognosis  above all  pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma   which substantiates a clinical need for the respective theranostic agents  The receptor furthermore represents a biomarker for malignancy and invasiveness of carcinomas  as well as for fibrotic diseases  such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  IPF   and probably even for Sars-CoV-2  COVID-19  related syndromes  Accordingly  the largest number of recent first-in-human applications has been reported for radiolabeled compounds targeting alphavbeta6-integrin  The results indicate a substantial clinical value  which might lead to a paradigm change and trigger the replacement of alphavbeta3 by alphavbeta6 as the most popular integrin in theranostics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34885066

6953,The arrival of the coronavirus in 2020 brought major changes to education  with the rapid transition to online classes being the most significant  In the case of university students  the pandemic meant returning to their homes  which can be interpreted as a temporary destudentification  This manuscript analyses and interprets the motivations of university students from Temuco  Chile  to change their social relations and place of residence as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic  Through a quantitative methodology that used more than 800 online surveys and a principal component analysis  it was concluded that the psychological well-being and the security provided by the family were the main causes for changing accommodation  but a total of four main components related to material conditions  economic aspects  family and psychological and physical well-being were identified  Similarly  although with the pandemic the family was the most reinforced dimension in terms of social relations  there were groups of students who were more connected to friends and colleagues or neighbours  The results point to a partial and temporary destudentification  explainable by the nature of the lease contract and the dependent role of the students with respect to the landlords,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899094

4352,SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause compromised respiratory function and thrombotic events  SARS-CoV-2 binds to and mediates downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  on cells that it infects  Theoretically  diminished enzymatic activity of ACE2 may result in increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory molecules  angiotensin II  and Bradykinin  contributing to SARS-CoV-2 pathology  Using immunofluorescence microscopy of lung tissues from uninfected  and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals  we find evidence that ACE2 is highly expressed in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and significantly reduced along the alveolar lining of SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs  Ex vivo analyses of primary human cells  indicated that ACE2 is readily detected in pulmonary alveolar epithelial and aortic endothelial cells  Exposure of these cells to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was sufficient to reduce ACE2 expression  Moreover  exposure of endothelial cells to spike protein-induced dysfunction  caspase activation  and apoptosis  Exposure of endothelial cells to bradykinin caused calcium signaling and endothelial dysfunction  increased expression of von Willibrand Factor and decreased expression of Kruppel-like Factor 2  but did not adversely affect viability in primary human aortic endothelial cells  Computer-assisted analyses of molecules with potential to bind bradykinin receptor B2  BKRB2   suggested a potential role for aspirin as a BK antagonist  When tested in our in vitro model  we found evidence that aspirin can blunt cell signaling and endothelial dysfunction caused by bradykinin in these cells  Interference with interactions of spike protein or bradykinin with endothelial cells may serve as an important strategy to stabilize microvascular homeostasis in COVID-19 disease  IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 causes complex effects on microvascular homeostasis that potentially contribute to organ dysfunction and coagulopathies  SARS-CoV-2 binds to  and causes downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  on cells that it infects  It is thought that reduced ACE2 enzymatic activity can contribute to inflammation and pathology in the lung  Our studies add to this understanding by providing evidence that spike protein alone can mediate adverse effects on vascular cells  Understanding these mechanisms of pathogenesis may provide rationale for interventions that could limit microvascular events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935423

5615,The management of elderly patients with dementia and COVID-19 infections without access to an intensive care unit gives rise to serious ethical conflicts  Therapeutic decisions have been made in psychogeriatric units  leaving a heavy moral burden on staff  They had to deal with the most difficult patients without the support of appropriate guidelines  The gap between established rules and hospital reality led to psychological distress and burnout  Managing uncertainty in medical decisions is a skill that doctors and staff learn through experience  However  with the COVID-19 pandemic  uncertainty about patient outcomes seems no longer acceptable  Geriatric triage has challenged professional conscience  emotions and values  The principle of distributive justice  which consists of giving each person in society what is rightfully his or hers  is not being respected during this pandemic  Charity has been reduced to patient survival  Staffs need to make decisions together  and it is important to allow all carers access to a space for reflection  In our unit  the involvement of nurses and care assistants in the decision-making process for patient care is crucial especially for refusal of care  Their view of the patient s condition is different from that of the doctors  as they provide daily care to the patient and stay in the wards for several hours with them  By including as many people as possible in the reflection  we could avoid moral or personal prejudices related to these difficult decisions  The current pandemic can give new meaning to team thinking  giving everyone a voice without hierarchical barriers  With these new waves of COVID-19  we need to rethink our therapeutic conduct for elderly patients with dementia to avoid ethical failure,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34916078
6935,This article examines managerial control practices in a public bureaucracy at the moment of introducing remote work as part with a new ways of working  NWW  project  The qualitative study builds on 38 interviews with supervisors and subordinates conducted before the advent of COVID-19  By interpreting interviewees  conversations about current and anticipated future work practices in the changing work setting  we reveal tacit and hidden practices of managerial control that are currently prevalent in many organizations introducing remote working  Three constitutive moments of the organization s transformation to NWW are analytically distinguished   i  how implicit becomes explicit   ii  how collective becomes self  and  iii  how personal becomes impersonal  Our findings emphasize that the transition to NWW must take into account prevailing institutional logics and must reconnect to a fundamental and often neglected question  What does doing work mean within the particular organization  Negotiating this fundamental question might help to overcome supervisors  uncertainties about managerial control and provide clarity to subordinates about what is expected from them while working remotely  Finally  we discuss how the transition to NWW may serve as both an opportunity and a potential threat to established organizational practices while highlighting the challenge supervisors face when the institutional logics conflict with remote working,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899447

4726,While COVID-19 brings unprecedented challenges to the US healthcare system  understanding narratives of historical disasters illuminates ethical complexities shared with COVID-19  In 2005  Hurricane Katrina revealed a lack of disaster preparation and protocol  not dissimilar to the challenges faced by COVID-19 healthcare workers  A case study of Memorial Hospital during Hurricane Katrina reported by journalist-MD Sheri Fink reveals unique ethical challenges at the forefront of health crises  These challenges include disproportionate suffering in structurally vulnerable populations  as seen in COVID-19 where marginalised groups across the USA experience higher rates of disease and COVID-19-related death  Journalistic accounts of Katrina and COVID-19 offer unique perspectives on the ethical challenges present within medicine and society  and analysis of such stories reveals narrative trajectories anticipated in the aftermath of COVID-19  Through lenses of social suffering and structural violence  these narratives reinforce the need for systemic change  including legal action  ethical preparedness and physician protection to ensure high-quality care during times of crises  Narrative Medicine-as a practice of interrogating stories in medicine and re-centering the patient-offers a means to contextualise individual accounts of suffering during health crises in larger social matrices,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930803
9569,A hallmark of COVID-19 is a hyperinflammatory state associated with severity  Monocytes undergo metabolic reprogramming and produce inflammatory cytokines when stimulated with SARS-CoV-2  We hypothesized that binding by the viral spike protein mediates this effect  and that drugs which regulate immunometabolism could inhibit the inflammatory response  Monocytes stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 showed a dose-dependent increase in glycolytic metabolism associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  This response was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha  as chetomin inhibited glycolysis and cytokine production  Inhibition of glycolytic metabolism by 2-deoxyglucose  2-DG  or glucose deprivation also inhibited the glycolytic response  and 2-DG strongly suppressed cytokine production  Glucose-deprived monocytes rescued cytokine production by upregulating oxidative phosphorylation  an effect which was not present in 2-DG-treated monocytes due to the known effect of 2-DG on suppressing mitochondrial metabolism  Finally  pre-treatment of monocytes with metformin strongly suppressed spike protein-mediated cytokine production and metabolic reprogramming  Likewise  metformin pre-treatment blocked cytokine induction by SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1 2020 in direct infection experiments  In summary  the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces a pro-inflammatory immunometabolic response in monocytes that can be suppressed by metformin  and metformin likewise suppresses inflammatory responses to live SARS-CoV-2  This has potential implications for the treatment of hyperinflammation during COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858397

6478,INTRODUCTION  This study aimed to examine the mental health of palliative care professionals in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic  the relationship of mental health with socio-demographic factors  and the impact of the pandemic on palliative care services  METHODS  A total of 142 palliative care professionals in Hong Kong participated in an online survey  The questionnaire includes measurements on depression  anxiety  perceived stress  post-traumatic stress  professional quality of life  items that measure the effect of COVID-19 on palliative care services  and one open-ended question for describing how the services were affected  Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were conducted  Quantitative and qualitative data about the impact of COVID-19 on palliative care services were analyzed and triangulated using a mixed-methods approach  RESULTS  Up to 82   43   and 42  of the participants felt moderately to highly stressed  anxious  and depressed  respectively  during the pandemic  Younger participants tended to have poorer mental health and professional quality of life  Around 82  felt stressed when communicating with patients and family members under the no-visiting policy during the pandemic  More than three-quarters of participants showed lack of confidence in the anti-epidemic policy of the government  Qualitative findings identified 3 themes affecting the provision of palliative care  1  the tightening of restrictions on visitors  2  the limited provision of services  and 3  staff deployment  CONCLUSIONS  Appropriate responses are required to give extra support to palliative care professionals during the pandemic and facilitate their coping with the impact of COVID-19 on the provision of palliative care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904449
9784,The Coronavirus disease  COVID-19  pandemic has prompted an unprecedented shift to remote work  Workers across the globe have used digital technologies to connect with teammates and others in their organizations  In what ways did the COVID-19 crisis alter the frequency and balance of internal and external team interactions  During a crisis  networking offers a type of goal-directed behavior through which individuals source and provide information  We can understand how people use their network through the lens of network churn  changes in embeddedness brought on by the creation  dissolution  and or reactivation of network ties  higher We posit that performing individuals exhibit distinct networking strategies as compared to lower performing employees during the pandemic  We present a field study conducted in a multinational industrial manufacturing company in China investigating network churn during the COVID-19 pandemic  Findings show that  during a crisis  job performance is positively related to the volume of inter-team tie creation and inter-team tie reactivation  but not intra-team tie creation and intra-team tie reactivation  Job performance is not related to the volume of intra- and inter-team tie dissolution  The study provides early  yet important insights into the interplay between crisis and organizational social networks   PsycInfo Database Record  c  2021 APA  all rights reserved,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855423
7976,Infectious respiratory diseases such as the current COVID-19 have caused public health crises and interfered with social activity  Given the complexity of these novel infectious diseases  their dynamic nature  along with rapid changes in social and occupational environments  technology  and means of interpersonal interaction  respiratory protective devices  RPDs  play a crucial role in controlling infection  particularly for viruses like SARS-CoV-2 that have a high transmission rate  strong viability  multiple infection routes and mechanisms  and emerging new variants that could reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines  Evidence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmissions further highlights the importance of a universal adoption of RPDs  RPDs have substantially improved over the past 100 years due to advances in technology  materials  and medical knowledge  However  several issues still need to be addressed such as engineering performance  comfort  testing standards  compliance monitoring  and regulations  especially considering the recent emergence of pathogens with novel transmission characteristics  In this review  we summarize existing knowledge and understanding on respiratory infectious diseases and their protection  discuss the emerging issues that influence the resulting protective and comfort performance of the RPDs  and provide insights in the identified knowledge gaps and future directions with diverse perspectives,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34883668
5216,PURPOSE OF REVIEW  The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in great and rapid change in our society  Although children are somewhat less likely to get infected or have severe symptoms from COVID-19  they are being adversely affected by this global public health emergency in many direct and indirect ways  This review focuses on the major areas in which children and adolescents are suffering  and how pediatricians can anticipate and optimize child healthcare and support as the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath continues  RECENT FINDINGS  This review provides preliminary insights into the physical  psychological  educational  developmental  behavioral  and social health implications of the pandemic on the pediatric population  highlighting both the pandemic s current and potential future impact on children  SUMMARY  The COVID-19 pandemic has and will likely continue to adversely affect many different aspects of children s health and well-being  It is important for pediatricians to be aware of these consequences of COVID-19 and take steps to help their patients now and in the future  Because the virus continues to ravage many parts of the world  continued research is needed to identify and evaluate any additional COVID-related challenges and concerns that adversely impact the growth and development of children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34923563
7302,Lipids have a wide variety and vital functions  Lipids play roles in energy metabolism  intracellular and extracellular signal traffic  and transport of fat-soluble vitamins  Also  they form the structure of the cell membrane  SARS-CoV-2 interacts with lipids since its genetic material contains lipid-enveloped ribonucleic acid  RNA   Previous studies have shown that total cholesterol  high-density lipoprotein  and low-density lipoprotein  LDL  levels are lower in patients with severe novel coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19 Na    H    Exchanger  NHE  is an important antiport that keeps the intracellular pH value within physiological limits  When the intracellular pH falls  NHE is activated and pumps H    ions outward  However  prolonged NHE activation causes cell damage and atherosclerosis  Prolonged NHE activation may increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 In COVID-19  increased angiotensin II  Ang II  due to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2  ACE2  dysfunction stimulates NHE  Lipids are in close association with the NHE pump  Prolonged NHE activity increases the influx of H    ions and free fatty acid  FFA  inward  Ang II also causes increased low-density lipoprotein receptor  LDLR  levels by inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9  PCSK9   Thus  intracellular atheroma plaque formation is accelerated Besides  SARS-CoV-2 may replicate more rapidly as intracellular cholesterol increases  SARS-CoV-2 swiftly infects the cell whose intracellular pH decreases with NHE activation and FFA movement  Novel treatment regimens based on NHE and lipids should be explored for the treatment of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34895256
8700,The COVID-19 pandemic reminds us that in spite of the scientific progress in the past century  there is a lack of general antiviral strategies  In analogy to broad-spectrum antibiotics as antibacterial agents  developing broad spectrum antiviral agents would buy us time for the development of vaccines and treatments for future viral infections  In addition to targeting viral factors  a possible strategy is to understand host immune defense mechanisms and develop methods to boost the antiviral immune response  Here we summarize the role of NAD -consuming enzymes in the immune defense against viral infections  with the hope that a better understanding of this process could help to develop better antiviral therapeutics targeting these enzymes  These NAD -consuming enzymes include PARPs  sirtuins  CD38  and SARM1  Among these  the antiviral function of PARPs is particularly important and will be a focus of this review  Interestingly  NAD  biosynthetic enzymes are also implicated in immune responses  In addition  many viruses  including SARS-CoV-2 contain a macrodomain-containing protein  NSP3 in SARS-CoV-2   which serves to counteract the antiviral function of host PARPs  Therefore  NAD  and NAD -consuming enzymes play crucial roles in immune responses against viral infections and detailed mechanistic understandings in the future will likely facilitate the development of general antiviral strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871367

5537,Background  The onset of the pandemic necessitated abrupt transition to telehealth consultations  Although there is a few tools that gauge the patients  perception about their experiences  none of them are contextualized to an emergency in the Middle East and North Africa region  Accordingly  this study aims at developing and validating a tool to address this gap  and deploying it to assess the patients  perception of telehealth services during COVID-19 in Dubai  United Arab Emirates  UAE   Methods  A convergent mixed methods design was adapted  A random selection of 100 patients from Dubai  UAE were invited to participate  Qualitative and quantitative datasets were collected using a tailor-made survey  The qualitative data  collected through open-ended questions  was analyzed using multi-staged thematic analysis  As for the quantitative data  it captured the patients  extent of satisfaction  and was assessed using SPSS  with a series of descriptive and inferential analyses   The qualitative and quantitative findings were then merged via joint display analysis  Results  Out of the 100 patients that were randomly selected  94 patients participated in this study  The reliability score of Cronbach s Alpha for the instrument was 98 9   The percentage of the total average of satisfaction was 80 67   The Principal Component Analysis showed that 88 1  of the variance can be explained by the instrument  p < 0 001   The qualitative data analysis expanded upon the quantitative findings enabling a better understanding of the patients  perception  Three themes  revolving around the quality of the patient telehealth experiences  surfaced   Factors that worked to the benefit of the patients    Factors that the patients were not in favor of   and  Opportunities for improvements as perceived by the patients   Discussion  This study introduced a novel patient satisfaction with telehealth consultation survey contextualized to the COVID-19 times in Dubai  UAE  The participants were quite satisfied with the quality of their experience  however they suggested areas for improvement  Regional healthcare decision-makers can leverage the identified advantages and opportunities for improvement of telehealth  This will enable making informed decisions regarding the continuity of telehealth irrespective of how matters unfold in relation to the pandemic  It will also better prepare the healthcare sector for potential resurgence s  of COVID-19 and or the occurrence of other similar emergencies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917570
2918,Viral infections causing pandemics and chronic diseases are the main culprits implicated in devastating global clinical and socioeconomic impacts  as clearly manifested during the current COVID-19 pandemic  Immunoprophylaxis via mass immunisation with vaccines has been shown to be an efficient strategy to control such viral infections  with the successful and recently accelerated development of different types of vaccines  thanks to the advanced biotechnological techniques involved in the upstream and downstream processing of these products  However  there is still much work to be done for the improvement of efficacy and safety when it comes to the choice of delivery systems  formulations  dosage form and route of administration  which are not only crucial for immunisation effectiveness  but also for vaccine stability  dose frequency  patient convenience and logistics for mass immunisation  In this review  we discuss the main vaccine delivery systems and associated challenges  as well as the recent success in developing nanomaterials-based and advanced delivery systems to tackle these challenges  Manufacturing and regulatory requirements for the development of these systems for successful clinical and marketing authorisation were also considered  Here  we comprehensively review nanovaccines from development to clinical application  which will be relevant to vaccine developers  regulators  and clinicians,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959372
3852,Immunofluorescence is a traditional diagnostic method for respiratory viruses  allowing rapid  simple and accurate diagnosis  with specific benefits of direct visualization of antigens-of-interest and quality assessment  This study aims to evaluate the potential of indirect immunofluorescence as an in-house diagnostic method for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from nasopharyngeal swabs  NPS   Three primary antibodies raised from mice were used for immunofluorescence staining  including monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein  and polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  Smears of cells from NPS of 29 COVID-19 patients and 20 non-infected individuals  and cells from viral culture were stained by the three antibodies  Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to identify respiratory epithelial cells with positive signals  Polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N protein had the highest sensitivity and specificity among the three antibodies tested  detecting 17 out of 29 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and demonstrating no cross-reactivity with other tested viruses except SARS-CoV  Detection of virus-infected cells targeting SARS-CoV-2 N protein allow identification of infected individuals  although accuracy is limited by sample quality and number of respiratory epithelial cells  The potential of immunofluorescence as a simple diagnostic method was demonstrated  which could be applied by incorporating antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 into multiplex immunofluorescence panels used clinically  such as for respiratory viruses  thus allowing additional routine testing for diagnosis and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 even after the epidemic has ended with low prevalence of COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943583

221,Introduction  During the COVID-19 pandemic  researchers have used Internet-based applications to conduct virtual group meetings  but this is not feasible in low-resource settings  In a community health research project in Bauchi State  Nigeria  COVID-19 restrictions precluded planned face-to-face meetings with community groups  We tested the feasibility of using cellular teleconferencing for these meetings  Methods  In an initial exercise  we used cellular teleconferencing to conduct six male and six female community focus group discussions  Informed by this experience  we conducted cellular teleconferences with 10 male and 10 female groups of community leaders  in different communities  to discuss progress with previously formulated action plans  Ahead of each teleconference call  a call coordinator contacted individual participants to seek consent and confirm availability  The coordinator connected the facilitator  the reporter  and the participants on each conference call  and audio-recorded the call  Each call lasted less than 1 h  Field notes and debriefing meetings with field teams supported the assessment of feasibility of the teleconference meetings  Results  Cellular teleconferencing was feasible and inexpensive  Using multiple handsets at the base allowed more participants in a call  Guidelines for facilitators and participants developed after the initial meetings were helpful  as were reminder calls ahead of the meeting  Connecting women participants was challenging  Facilitators needed extra practice to support group interactions without eye contact and body language signals  Conclusions  With careful preparation and training  cellular teleconferencing can be a feasible and inexpensive method of conducting group discussions in a low-resource setting,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35003757
2586,BACKGROUND  Coronavirus 2019 Covid-19  pandemic is representing a massive burden to the community with the new virus  There is few data regarding Covid -19 in liver transplant patients  Concerns were raised regarding the course of the disease in transplanted patients due to immunosuppression and risk of hepatic injuries  AIM  To describe the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in recipients of living donor liver transplantation  METHODS  Retrospective analysis of forty-one recipients of living donor liver transplantation diagnosed with covid-19 by real time PCR or CT chest criteria of COVID 19 between April 2020 to April 2021  This Cohort was derived from Ain Shams Center for Organ Transplantation database  Ain Shams Specialized Hospital  Cairo  Egypt  which is considered one of the largest centers of LDLT in the Middle East  Patients were classified to mild  moderate  severe and critics according to clinical classification released by the National Health Commission of China  RESULTS  Forty-one  41  patients and 2 patients with reinfection were included in this cohort with mean age 54 y with 74  male and 26  female  The body mass index ranged from 19 3-37  Thirty  30   percent were described as a mild case  46 5  were moderate  14  were severe and 9  were critical cases  Two cases developed infection twice  Twenty patients  46 5   were managed in home isolation setting  17 patients  39 5   needed admission to ward  Four patients  9   in intermediate care unit and Two patients  4   admitted to intensive care unit  ICU  Sixty percent 60   of cases were on room air  only 3 patients needed invasive methods  2 patients needed face mask and one case needed invasive CPAP  Forty-one patients recovered  95   and two patients  5   died  one was Covid related and the other one was non-Covid related  Female gender  higher BMI and hypertension were associated with severe course of the disease  CONCLUSION  In the setting of living donor liver transplantation  the possibilities of catching Covid-19 infection is high due to chronic immunosuppression use  Yet  the outcome of infection in term of morbidity and the needs for hospital admission or Intensive care is generally matched to general population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963013
1115,Remote work has become the most popular approach during the COVID-19 lockdown  however  remote work engagement is an issue which creates challenges for human resource management  Some individuals engage in work no matter how difficult the job is  but some people s minds wander  no matter how simple the job is  To address this issue  this study drew on trait activation theory  which indicates that one s positive disposition may affect one s turnover intention mediated by work engagement  to formulate a research model to test the associations among R D professionals  Questionnaires were distributed to R D professionals working in China information and communication technology  ICT  through several Instant Message groups  In total  386 valid questionnaires were collected for confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling to verify the research model  The study found that positive affect can positively predict three types of remote work engagement  the cognitive  emotional  and behavioral engagement of R D personnel  All three types of remote work engagement of R D personnel can negatively predict their turnover intention  The results suggest that if human resource managers working in the ICT industry want to reduce the turnover intention rate of R D workers under pressure from COVID-19  they should enhance workers  remote engagement by selecting R D workers with a high level of positive affect,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987446
9382,PURPOSE  Already at high-risk for adverse consequences associated with daily living  youth experiencing homelessness face additional barriers to health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic  The purpose of this study was to identify the self-reported experiences and healthcare needs of youth experiencing homelessness as services in the community began to shut down at the beginning of the pandemic  METHOD  From May through November 2020  qualitative data were obtained by telephone or Facebook messenger from 20 youth  M 22 4  SD 2 64years  who had been enrolled in a longitudinal intervention study  RESULTS  Content analysis of qualitative data yielded 5 categories and 1 overall theme  Categories were resource availability  financial instability  mental health  relationship conflict  and maladaptive coping  The overall theme was multiple losses  Youths lost jobs  means of financial support for self and family  access to social and healthcare services  meaningful and important relationships  and skills and controls over high-risk behaviors such as substance abuse  CONCLUSIONS  Having similar experiences such as social isolation as those of high school students during the pandemic  the youths in this sample experienced multiple and simultaneous losses  needing time to grieve  and leaving them once more at high-risk for adverse outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861960
3026,The Covid-19 pandemic has affected global educational systems  especially in developing countries  Therefore  governments and educational administrators have adopted contingency measures to maintain the functioning and the sustainability of their national educational systems  These measures involved the use of technologies and have enabled a significant amount of teachers to continue working with their students around the globe  This article aims to analyze the perception of Ecuadorian teachers about the contingency measures taken at the governmental and institutional levels while facing the COVID-19 crisis  Also  several aspects regarding the teachers  perceptions about their technological skills  access to electronic devices  and implications of teleworking in their mental health and performance are also analyzed  A cross-sectional study was carried out with 3 183 Ecuadorian teachers working at all levels of education  An online questionnaire which obtained a reliability of 0 84 in Cronbach s Alpha was used  The results show that despite the high levels of uncertainty  most teachers agreed with the measures that had been taken by the Government  the Ministry of Education as well as their institutions and reported feeling comfortable with teleworking  However  the lack of technological resources in rural areas and the lack of trust in the effectiveness of online classes are aspects that need to be analyzed before considering the viability of long-term online education in Ecuador,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957339
8676,The remarkable success of SARS CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines and the ensuing interest in mRNA vaccines and therapeutics have highlighted the need for a scalable clinical-enabling manufacturing process to produce such products  and robust analytical methods to demonstrate safety  potency  and purity  To date  production processes have either not been disclosed or are bench-scale in nature and cannot be readily adapted to clinical and commercial scale production  To address these needs  we have advanced an aqueous-based scalable process that is readily adaptable to GMP-compliant manufacturing  and developed the required analytical methods for product characterization  quality control release  and stability testing  We also have demonstrated the products produced at manufacturing scale under such approaches display good potency and protection in relevant animal models with mRNA products encoding both vaccine immunogens and antibodies  Finally  we discuss continued challenges in raw material identification  sourcing and supply  and the cold chain requirements for mRNA therapeutic and vaccine products  While ultimate solutions have yet to be elucidated  we discuss approaches that can be taken that are aligned with regulatory guidance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871810
476,There is robust evidence linking vascular health to brain health  cognition  and dementia  In this article  we present evidence from trials of vascular risk factor treatment on cognitive outcomes  We summarize findings from randomized controlled trials of antihypertensives  lipid-lowering medications  diabetes treatments  including antidiabetic drugs versus placebo  and intensive versus standard glycemic control   and multidomain interventions  that target several domains simultaneously such as control of vascular and metabolic factors  nutrition  physical activity  and cognitive stimulation etc   We report that evidence on the efficacy of vascular risk reduction interventions is promising  but not yet conclusive  and several methodological limitations hamper interpretation  Evidence mainly comes from high-income countries and  as cognition and dementia have not been the primary outcomes of many trials  evaluation of cognitive changes have often been limited  As the cognitive aging process occurs over decades  it is unclear whether treatment during the late-life window is optimal for dementia prevention  yet older individuals have been the target of most trials thus far  Further  many trials have not been powered to explore interactions with modifiers such as age  race  and apolipoprotein E  even though sub-analyses from some trials indicate that the success of interventions differs depending on patient characteristics  Due to the complex multifactorial etiology of dementia  and variations in risk factors between individuals  multidomain interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms are likely to be needed and the long-term sustainability of preventive interventions will require personalized approaches that could be facilitated by digital health tools  This is especially relevant during the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  where intervention strategies will need to be adapted to the new normal  when face-to-face engagement with participants is limited and public health measures may create changes in lifestyle that affect individuals  vascular risk profiles and subsequent risk of cognitive decline,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000424
7566,Significance  Findings regarding changes in substance use since COVID-19 have been mixed  potentially due to differences in methods used to assess change  Thus  we compared changes in substance use per retrospective self-report at one time-point  March-May 2020  versus prospective  longitudinal self-report across 2 time-points  Sept-Dec 2019  March-May 2020   and identified predictors of discordance  Methods  We analyzed data from a longitudinal study of 1 082 young adults from 6 metropolitan areas  Across cigarettes  e-cigarettes  marijuana  and alcohol  participants were categorized as Increasers  increased based on both methods   Decreasers Stable  decreased same per both methods   Over-reporters  decreased same per longitudinal data increased via retrospective report   or Under-reporters  increased per longitudinal data decreased same via retrospective report   We identified predictors  e g   sociodemographics  pre-pandemic substance use levels  of Under-reporting  Results  In this sample  Mage 24 77  45 7  male  32 1  sexual minority  4 0  Black  12 4  Asian  12 6  Hispanic   longitudinal data indicated that the proportions of cigarette  e-cigarette  marijuana  and alcohol users who increased their use were 43 3   41 7   52 6   and 55 6   respectively  Examining concordance discordance groups  Under-reporters accounted for between 17 7   alcohol  and 26 8   e-cigarette  of users  over-reporters comprised among the smallest proportions of each group  17 4  for alcohol to 22 2  for marijuana   Multivariable regression indicated that predictors of Under-reporting were less pre-pandemic use across substances  being older for e-cigarettes  and being older  male  and Asian for alcohol  Conclusions  Findings highlight methodological variability as a potential reason for mixed findings regarding pandemic-related substance use change and underscore the need for rigorously designed research to accurately assess the population impact of COVID-19 and other historical events,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889710
2495,The emergence of multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  variants of concern threatens the efficacy of currently approved vaccines and authorized therapeutic monoclonal antibodies  MAbs   It is hence important to continue searching for SARS-CoV-2 broadly neutralizing MAbs and defining their epitopes  Here  we isolate 9 neutralizing mouse MAbs raised against the spike protein of a SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and evaluate their neutralizing potency towards a panel of variants  including B 1 1 7  B 1 351  B 1 617 1  and B 1 617 2  By using a combination of biochemical  virological  and cryo-EM structural analyses  we identify three types of cross-variant neutralizing MAbs  represented by S5D2  S5G2  and S3H3  respectively  and further define their epitopes  S5D2 binds the top lateral edge of the receptor-binding motif within the receptor-binding domain  RBD  with a binding footprint centered around the loop 477-489   and efficiently neutralizes all variant pseudoviruses  but the potency against B 1 617 2 was observed to decrease significantly  S5G2 targets the highly conserved RBD core region and exhibits comparable neutralization towards the variant panel  S3H3 binds a previously unreported epitope located within the evolutionarily stable SD1 region and is able to near equally neutralize all of the variants tested  Our work thus defines three distinct cross-variant neutralizing sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein  providing guidance for design and development of broadly effective vaccines and MAb-based therapies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34964428
6245,Objective  We measure the prevalence of noncompliance with public health guidelines in the COVID-19 pandemic and examine how it is shaped by political ideology across countries  Methods  A list experiment of noncompliance and a multi-item scale of health-related behaviors were embedded in a comparative survey of 11 000 respondents in nine OCED countries  We conduct a statistical analysis of the list experiment capturing degrees of noncompliance with social distancing rules and estimate ideological effect heterogeneity  A semiparametric analysis examines the functional form of the relationship between ideology and the propensity to violate public health guidelines  Results  Our analyses reveal substantial heterogeneity between countries  Ideology plays an outsized role in the United States  No association of comparable magnitude is found in the majority of the other countries in our study  In many settings  the impact of ideology on health-related behaviors is nonlinear  Conclusion  Our results highlight the importance of taking a comparative perspective  Extrapolating the role of ideology from the United States to other advanced industrialized societies might paint an erroneous picture of the scope of possible nonpharmaceutical interventions  Heterogeneity limits the extent to which policymakers can learn from experiences across borders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908607

3022,The recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  has become a significant and topmost global health challenge of today  SARS-CoV-2 can propagate through several direct or indirect means resulting in its exponential spread in short times  Consequently  finding new research based real-world and feasible solutions to interrupt the spread of pathogenic microorganisms is indispensable  It has been established that this virus can survive on a variety of available surfaces ranging from a few hours to a few days  which has increased the risk of COVID-19 spread to large populations  Currently  available surface disinfectant chemicals provide only a temporary solution and are not recommended to be used in the long run due to their toxicity and irritation  Apart from the urgent development of vaccine and antiviral drugs  there is also a need to design and develop surface disinfectant antiviral coatings for long-term applications even for new variants  The unique physicochemical properties of graphene-based nanomaterials  GBNs  have been widely investigated for antimicrobial applications  However  the research work for their use in antimicrobial surface coatings is minimal  This perspective enlightens the scope of using GBNs as antimicrobial antiviral surface coatings to reduce the spread of transmittable microorganisms  precisely  SARS-CoV-2  This study attempts to demonstrate the synergistic effect of GBNs and metallic nanoparticles  MNPs   for their potential antiviral applications in the development of surface disinfectant coatings  Some proposed mechanisms for the antiviral activity of the graphene family against SARS-CoV-2 has also been explained  It is anticipated that this study will potentially lead to new insights and future trends to develop a framework for further investigation on this research area of pivotal importance to minimize the transmission of current and any future viral outbreaks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957347
8698,BACKGROUND  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination is recommended for all individuals with inflammatory bowel disease  IBD   including those on immunosuppressive therapies  however  little is known about vaccine safety and efficacy in these patients or the impact of vaccination on IBD disease course  METHODS  We evaluated coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccine-related adverse events  AEs  and the effect of vaccination on IBD disease course among participants in the PREVENT-COVID  Partnership to Report Effectiveness of Vaccination in populations Excluded from iNitial Trials of COVID  study  a prospective  observational cohort study  Localized and systemic reactions were assessed via questionnaire  Disease flare was defined by worsening IBD symptoms and change in IBD medications  Outcomes were stratified by vaccine type and IBD medication classes  RESULTS  A total of 3316 individuals with IBD received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine  Injection site tenderness  68   and fatigue  46  dose 1  68  dose 2  were the most commonly reported localized and systemic AEs after vaccination  Severe localized and systemic vaccine-related AEs were rare  The mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with significantly greater severe AEs at dose 2  localized 4  vs 2   systemic 15  vs 10   P <  001 for both   Prior COVID-19 infection  female sex  and vaccine type were associated with severe systemic reactions to dose 1  while age <50 years  female sex  vaccine type  and antitumor necrosis factor and vedolizumab use were associated with severe systemic reactions to dose 2  Overall rates  2   of IBD flare were low following vaccination  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings provide reassurance that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine is safe and well tolerated among individuals with IBD  which may help to combat vaccine hesitancy and increase vaccine confidence,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871388
324,The continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic largely depends on the spread of virus-carrying aerosols in ambient air  The mechanism of virus transmission and infection remains under intense investigation  In this study  an evaporation flow model of airborne sputum droplets is proposed which considers the evolution effects of the humidity field under different particle distributions and solid salt fraction interactions  The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations characterize a stream of airflow jets  and the convection-diffusion-evaporation process is used to account for the inhomogeneous humidity field caused by the respiratory tract  Momentum equations for droplet dynamics which involve the effects of drag  gravity  and Brownian motion on sputum droplets are introduced to quantify the transport of droplets in a humidity field  The Lattice Boltzmann method is used to track the evolution of the aerosol in space and time under different ambient temperature and relative humidity conditions  The results of the simulation demonstrate that airborne humidity accelerates the evaporation rate of droplet  while supersaturated humid air forms a vapor mass in front of the respiratory tract  Despite the short lifespan of this phenomenon  it significantly hinders the evaporation of the droplets  Besides  the droplet vortex dynamics in a humidity field are sensitive to the droplet size,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002203

7765,INTRODUCTION  Several studies have analyzed the influence of meteorological and geographical factors on the incidence of COVID-19  Seasonality could be important in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2  This study aims to evaluate the geographical pattern of COVID-19 in Spain and its relationship with different meteorological variables  METHODS  A provincial ecological study analyzing the influence of meteorological and geographical factors on the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the 52  24 coastal and 28 inland  Spanish provinces during the first three waves was carried out  The cumulative incidence was calculated with data from the National Statistical Institute  INE  and the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network  RENAVE   while the meteorological variables were obtained from the Spanish Meteorological Agency  AEMET   RESULTS  The total cumulative incidence  in all three waves  was lower in the coastal provinces than in the inland ones  566  -181 vs  782  -154  p 2 5x10 -5    The cumulative incidence correlated negatively with mean air temperature  r -0 49  p 2 2x10 -4   and rainfall  r -0 33  p 0 01   and positively with altitude  r 0 56  p 1  4x10 -5    The Spanish provinces with an average temperature <10 degrees C had almost twice the cumulative incidence than the provinces with temperatures >16 degrees C  The mean air temperature and rainfall were associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19  regardless of other factors  Beta Coefficient of -0 62  p 3 7x10 -7  and -0 47  p 4 2x10 -5  respectively   CONCLUSIONS  Meteorological and geographical factors could influence the evolution of the pandemic in Spain  Knowledge regarding the seasonality of the virus would help to predict new waves of COVID-19 infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34887065
4121,Understanding why or how the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has occurred and how to control them is crucial as regards the potential of global reopening  To explore and further understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of the B 1 1 7 spread in the 368 districts of Taiwan  a district-level geographic prediction model of the risk of COVID-19 symptom onset has been proposed  It has been found that   a  the human mobility  epidemic alert measures  and vaccination rates all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of B 1 1 7 transmission   b  for regions with high human mobility and low vaccination rates  the partial relaxation of entry quarantine measures for specific imported groups would  in fact  lead to a wide spread of B 1 1 7 with a consequent doubling of high-onset-risk areas and together with the overall onset risk  a further increase of more than 20  would occur   c  compared with the closing of business places and public venues in all districts  both lockdown in those areas of high-onset-risk and the gathered control effects regarding other districts  the control of B 1 1 7 spread would be better enabled by an onset risk reduction of up to 91 36   Additionally  an increase in the vaccination rate in each district by up to 5-10 times would further reduce the onset risk by 6 07 -62 22,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938933
1282,Purpose  The aim of the study was to assess the antibody response to the ChAdOx1-nCoV vaccine in individuals who were not previously infected by COVID-19  Patients and Methods  All people aged 18-65 years who received their first vaccination with ChAdOx1-nCoV from March to May 2021 were approached for inclusion  Individuals with sufficient antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination were considered previously infected and were excluded from the analysis  We observed viral spike protein RBD-S1-specific IgG antibody levels at day 28 of the first dose of vaccination and day 14 of the second dose of vaccination  74 days from index vaccination   An optical density ratio  ODR  of >1 1 was considered to have a positive antibody response  0 8 to 1 1 borderline and <0 8 was denoted as negative  Informed consent was ensured before enrollment  and ethical principles conformed with the current Declaration of Helsinki  Results  This observational study comprised 769 infection-naive individuals  mean age 40 5 years  38 9  female   Spike-specific IgG antibody responses elicited after the first and second doses of vaccine were 99 9  and 100   respectively  The median ODR was 5 43  interquartile range  IQR   4 32-6 98  and 10 90  IQR 9 02-11 90  after the first and second doses  Higher age was associated with lower antibody levels after both dosages  However  no sex-specific variation was seen  People with comorbidity had a lower antibody level after the second dose  Tenderness  51 46   and fever  19 30   were the most common local and systemic side effects after vaccination  Conclusion  This study was one of the earlier attempts in the country to assess the antibody response to ChAdOx1-nCoV vaccine recipients  The results imply that general people should be encouraged to take the vaccine at their earliest,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984006
3753,BACKGROUND  Pulmonary rehabilitation  PR  following severe and very severe COVID-19 infection is known to be effective  according to typical assessments  However  not all patients benefit from PR to the same extent  This analysis aimed to identify the impact of different factors on PR outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients  METHODS  This prospective observational study included 184 post-COVID-19 patients  The achievement of the predicted reference walking distance  6 min walking distance  6-MWD   served as a parameter with which to identify responders and non-responders to PR  Several parameters  e g   Functional Independent Measurement  FIM   pulmonary function testing  Forced Vital Capacity  FVC   6MWD  were assessed in order to estimate their impact on PR success  Logistic regression models and classification and regression trees were used for multivariate analysis  RESULTS  A total of 94 patients  51   reached their reference 6MWD by the end of PR  FVC  0 95  0 93-0 97    6MWD at admission  0 99  0 99-1 00    and FIM motoric  0 96  0 93-0 99   correlated with the risk not reaching the reference distance  The most important variable was the 6MWD at admission  Classification and regression tree identified 6MWD >   130 m at admission and FVC predicted of >83  as the strongest predictor for reaching predicted 6-MWD  CONCLUSION  Post-COVID-19 patients with lower 6MWD  lower motoric FIM scores and lower FVC at admission have a high risk of not reaching their target values of physical performance despite intensive rehabilitation  As well as identifying them  it is of utmost importance to develop optimal PR concepts for these patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946054

4972,Face masks are critical in preventing the spread of respiratory infections including coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Different types of masks have distinct filtration efficiencies  FEs  with differential costs and supplies  Here we reported the impact of breathing volume and wearing time on the inward and outward FEs of four different mask types  N95  surgical  single-use  and cloth masks  against various sizes of aerosols  Specifically  1  Mask type was an important factor affecting the FEs  The FEs of N95 and surgical mask were better than those of single-use mask and cloth mask  2  As particle size decreased  the FEs tended to reduce  The trend was significantly observed in FEs of aerosols with particle size < 1 mu m   3  After wearing N95 and surgical masks for 0  2  4  and 8 h  their FEs     maintained from 95 75   - 0 09 to 100   - 0 range  While a significant decrease in FEs were noticed for single-use masks worn for 8 h and cloth masks worn >2 h under deep breathing  30 L min   4  Both inward and outward FEs of N95 and surgical masks were similar  while the outward FEs of single-use and cloth masks were higher than their inward FEs  5  The FEs under deep breathing was significantly lower than normal breathing with aerosol particle size <1 mu m  In conclusion  our results revealed that masks have a critical role in preventing the spread of aerosol particles by filtering inhalation  and FEs significantly decreased with the increasing of respiratory volume and wearing time  Deep breathing may cause increasing humidity and hence decrease FEs by increasing the airflow pressure  With the increase of wearing time  the adsorption capacity of the filter material tends to be saturated  which may reduce FEs  Findings may be used to provide information for policies regarding the proper use of masks for general public in current and future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926728
624,A recent mutation analysis suggested that Non-Structural Protein 6  NSP6  of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is a key determinant of the viral pathogenicity  Here  by transcriptome analysis  we demonstrated that the inflammasome-related NOD-like receptor signaling was activated in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells and Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  patients  lung tissues  The induction of inflammasomes pyroptosis in patients with severe COVID-19 was confirmed by serological markers  Overexpression of NSP6 triggered NLRP3 ASC-dependent caspase-1 activation  interleukin-1beta 18 maturation  and pyroptosis of lung epithelial cells  Upstream  NSP6 impaired lysosome acidification to inhibit autophagic flux  whose restoration by 1alpha 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3  metformin or polydatin abrogated NSP6-induced pyroptosis  NSP6 directly interacted with ATP6AP1  a vacuolar ATPase proton pump component  and inhibited its cleavage-mediated activation  L37F NSP6 variant  which was associated with asymptomatic COVID-19  exhibited reduced binding to ATP6AP1 and weakened ability to impair lysosome acidification to induce pyroptosis  Consistently  infection of cultured lung epithelial cells with live SARS-CoV-2 resulted in autophagic flux stagnation  inflammasome activation  and pyroptosis  Overall  this work supports that NSP6 of SARS-CoV-2 could induce inflammatory cell death in lung epithelial cells  through which pharmacological rectification of autophagic flux might be therapeutically exploited,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997207

3960,INTRODUCTION  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the presentation of many medical and surgical conditions  including major trauma  We aimed to assess how lockdown changed the presentation  severity and management of major trauma patients at our level 1 trauma centre in England  METHODS  Data were collected retrospectively from the Trauma Audit and Research Network s database between 23 March and 28 April 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019  Collected data included patient demographics  and the mechanism  severity and management of injuries  RESULTS  We experienced a 56 4  reduction in major trauma admissions during the lockdown period when compared with 2019  In 2020  more patients arrived in haemodynamic shock  25 3  vs 12 2   p 0 02   however  Glasgow Coma Scale and Injury Severity Score were unchanged  A higher proportion of incidents occurred at home  37 2  vs 53 5   p 0 018   with no difference in trauma secondary to substance abuse or assault  During lockdown  patients had a significantly shorter hospital  17 vs 10 days  p 0 029  and critical care stay  2 vs 1 day  p 0 033   A higher proportion of major trauma patients were assessed by specialty trainees in the emergency department in 2020  12 8  vs 53 1   p 0 0001  with a lower proportion assessed by a consultant  69 8  vs 46 7   p 0 001   CONCLUSIONS  The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown drastically changed human behaviour  as reflected in the change in presentation of major trauma  Changes in the management of these patients reflect adaptive measures to manage the pressures generated by the worldwide pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941462
3025,The emergency created by Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has inevitably changed human normal social and relational habits  The use of personal protective equipment  like surgical masks  by healthcare workers has been recommended to prevent human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus infection  However  the use of these masks could cause slight to considerable and reproducible changes in the infant s attitude towards the operator and health taker during routine clinical assessments  We reported a brief report on the impact of to the use of the surgical masks on the affective behaviour in 40 infants of age 2-9 months  study group  by using a scale to assess pain and distress among pediatric patients  the Face  Legs  Activity Cry and Consolability Scale  FLACC   and in 40 infants with the same ages and characteristics assessed before the COVID-19 pandemia onset  control group   Thirty-seven of the 40 infants in the study group had some signs of discomfort and appeared irritable and less prone to be engaged by the examiner with a different pattern of responses related to age with better responses for younger infants  These infants reported higher significant scores  p < 0 001  in the FLACC scale than those assessed before the COVID-19 onset  Infants appear to react negatively to the use of the surgical mask by the health operator  A different way to assess paediatric patients in early infancy with longitudinal studies should be proposed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957340
724,The necessity of managing stress levels is becoming increasingly apparent as the world suffers from different kinds of stresses including the extent of pandemic  the corona virus disease 2019  COVID-19   Cortisol  a clinically confirmed stress hormone related to depression and anxiety  affects individuals mentally and physically  However  current cortisol monitoring methods require expert personnel  large and complex machines  and long time for data analysis  Here  we present a flexible and wearable cortisol aptasensor for simple and rapid cortisol real-time monitoring  The sensing channel was produced by electrospinning conducting polyacrylonitrile  PAN  nanofibers  NFs  and subsequent vapor deposition of carboxylated poly 3 4-ethylenedioxythiophene   PEDOT   The conjugation of the cortisol aptamer on the PEDOT-PAN NFs provided the critical sensing mechanism for the target molecule  The sensing test was performed with a liquid-ion gated field-effect transistor  FET  on a polyester  polyethylene terepthalate   The sensor performance showed a detection limit of 10 pM  <5 s  and high selectivity in the presence of interference materials at 100 times higher concentrations  The practical usage and real-time monitoring of the cortisol aptasensor with a liquid-ion gated FET system was demonstrated by successful transfer to the swab and the skin  In addition  the real-time monitoring of actual sweat by applying the cortisol aptasensor was also successful since the aptasensor was able to detect cortisol approximately 1 nM from actual sweat in a few minutes  This wearable biosensor platform supports the possibility of further application and on-site monitoring for changes of other numerous biomarkers,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995062

1740,This case report describes a 60 year-old Black-American male with a past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus  HIV  infection and hyperthyroidism  who suffered a bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax  SP  in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pneumonia  SP is a well-established complication in HIV-positive patients and only recently has been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  infection  While HIV and COVID-19 infections have been independently linked with increased risk of SP development  it is unknown if both infections interact in a synergistic fashion to exacerbate SP risk  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   patients living with HIV have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection and the mechanism remains to be elucidated  To the best of our knowledge  this is the first report of a HIV-positive patient  who in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection  developed bilateral apical spontaneous pneumothorax and was later found to have a left lower lobe tension pneumothorax  This case highlights the importance of considering SP on the differential diagnosis when HIV-positive patients suddenly develop respiratory distress in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977051
4867,INTRODUCTION  The diagnosis of COVID-19 is normally based on the qualitative detection of viral nucleic acid sequences  Properties of the host response are not measured but are key in determining outcome  Although metabolic profiles are well suited to capture host state  most metabolomics studies are either underpowered  measure only a restricted subset of metabolites  compare infected individuals against uninfected control cohorts that are not suitably matched  or do not provide a compact predictive model  OBJECTIVES  Here we provide a well-powered  untargeted metabolomics assessment of 120 COVID-19 patient samples acquired at hospital admission  The study aims to predict the patient s infection severity  i e   mild or severe  and potential outcome  i e   discharged or deceased   METHODS  High resolution untargeted UHPLC-MS MS analysis was performed on patient serum using both positive and negative ionization modes  A subset of 20 intermediary metabolites predictive of severity or outcome were selected based on univariate statistical significance and a multiple predictor Bayesian logistic regression model was created  RESULTS  The predictors were selected for their relevant biological function and include deoxycytidine and ureidopropionate  indirectly reflecting viral load   kynurenine  reflecting host inflammatory response   and multiple short chain acylcarnitines  energy metabolism  among others  Currently  this approach predicts outcome and severity with a Monte Carlo cross validated area under the ROC curve of 0 792  SD 0 09  and 0 793  SD 0 08   respectively  A blind validation study on an additional 90 patients predicted outcome and severity at ROC AUC of 0 83  CI 0 74-0 91  and 0 76  CI 0 67-0 86   CONCLUSION  Prognostic tests based on the markers discussed in this paper could allow improvement in the planning of COVID-19 patient treatment,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34928464
4588,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infects a broader range of mammalian species than previously predicted  binding a diversity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2  orthologs despite extensive sequence divergence  Within this sequence degeneracy  we identify a rare sequence combination capable of conferring SARS-CoV-2 resistance  We demonstrate that this sequence was likely unattainable during human evolution due to deleterious effects on ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity  which has vasodilatory and cardioprotective functions in vivo  Across the 25 ACE2 sites implicated in viral binding  we identify 6 amino acid substitutions unique to mouse-one of the only known mammalian species resistant to SARS-CoV-2  Substituting human variants at these positions is sufficient to confer binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to mouse ACE2  facilitating cellular infection  Conversely  substituting mouse variants into either human or dog ACE2 abolishes viral binding  diminishing cellular infection  However  these same substitutions decrease human ACE2 activity by 50  and are predicted as pathogenic  consistent with the extreme rarity of human polymorphisms at these sites  This trade-off can be avoided  however  depending on genetic background  if substituted simultaneously  these same mutations have no deleterious effect on dog ACE2 nor that of the rodent ancestor estimated to exist 70 million years ago  This genetic contingency  epistasis  may have therefore opened the road to resistance for some species  while making humans susceptible to viruses that use these ACE2 surfaces for binding  as does SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932561
7578,OBJECTIVES  Hospital at home  HAH  is a health care delivery model that substitutes hospital-level services in the home for inpatient hospitalizations  HAH has been shown to be safe and effective for medical patients but has not been investigated in surgical readmissions  We estimated the potential impact of an HAH program for patients readmitted within 60 days postoperatively and described the characteristics of eligible patients to aid in the design of future programs  STUDY DESIGN  This was a cross-sectional study of 60-day postoperative readmissions at a tertiary care center in 2018  METHODS  We identified the number of readmissions that may have been eligible for HAH  collected descriptive information  and estimated the financial margin that could have been generated had eligible readmissions been diverted to HAH  RESULTS  There were 2366 readmissions within 60 days of surgery in 2018  A total of 731 readmissions met inclusion criteria for HAH  30 1    accounting for 4152 bed days  Of these readmissions  the most common diagnoses were infection  gastrointestinal complications  and cardiac complications  Patients  home addresses were within 16 miles of the hospital in 447 cases  61 1    Avoidance of these readmissions and use of the beds for new admissions represented a potential backfill margin of  8 8 million  not incorporating the cost of HAH  CONCLUSIONS  Many 60-day postoperative readmissions may be amenable to HAH enrollment  representing a significant opportunity to improve patient experience and generate hospital revenue  This is of particular interest in the post-COVID-19 era  To maximize their impact  HAH programs should tailor clinical and operational services to this population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889584
4071,BACKGROUND  Healthcare Workers  HCWs  are a key element in managing the COVID-19 pandemic  but they are also at high risk of infection  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this study was to describe  in a large university hospital which provided healthcare services to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection  the course of the epidemic among HCWs and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease  METHODS  Our case series included all  Fatebenefratelli Sacco  University Hospital workers  Data were collected until the 15th of May 2021 and analysed as part of the health surveillance program carried out by the Occupational Health Unit  RESULTS  From March 2020 until May 2021  14 4  of workers contracted COVID-19  with the highest incidence peak recorded during the second wave of the pandemic  The prevalence of infection was slightly higher in males than in females  and a greater number of cases was found in job categories characterized by direct patient care activities  We reported a higher prevalence of  serious critical illness  in elder workers  A clear reduction of COVID-19 incidence was found in our population during the third pandemic wave  that coincided with the start of vaccination campaign  DISCUSSION  HCWs have been at high risk of COVID-19 infection  Male sex and advanced age appear to be predisposing factor and negative prognostic factor respectively  An out-of-hospital setting appears to be the main source of COVID-19 confirming that the correct use of protective devices during work counters the risk of infection  Vaccination seems to reduce both documented cases of infection and severe illness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939623
1078,Introduction During the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic in India  several characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients  based on demographics  mortality predictors  and presence of comorbidities  were found to be associated with poor outcomes  The objective of this study was to identify such epidemiological and clinical characteristics among the patients admitted at a tertiary-care center in India that may have predisposed them to COVID-19-related mortality  Methods This retrospective observational study conducted at the Department of Medicine  All India Institute of Medical Sciences  New Delhi  in May 2021 included 141 COVID-19 confirmed patients  The medical history  demographic characteristics  comorbidities  clinical findings  and laboratory data of each patient were obtained  The data were analyzed to identify significant clinical and laboratory parameters that led to the adverse final outcomes  Results Hypertension was the most common comorbidity and the presence of diabetes with hypertension led to poorer final outcomes  Lower oxygen saturation and requirement of oxygen supplementation at admission along with worse prognostic scores during admission led to poorer outcomes  Twenty-seven patients needed non-invasive ventilation  NIV  during the hospital course  and all ultimately landed up among the 56 patients who were managed on invasive mechanical ventilation  IMV   Multivariate logistic regression analysis performed identified COVID-19 severity at admission  co-existence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus  systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg  and serum creatinine greater than 1 2 mg dL to be associated with higher COVID-19 mortality  Conclusion COVID-19 patients having the co-existence of diabetes and hypertension constitute a high-risk group and may be targeted by prompt vaccination strategies  The presence of severe disease along with a need for oxygen therapy and other intensive care interventions ultimately led to unfavorable outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987936
3693,The COVID-19 pandemic brought visibility and intensified the discussions on the European Union s  EU  health mandate  The proposals of the European Commission  EC  to move towards a European Health Union  EHU  can be seen as a starting point towards more integration in health  However  the definition of what the EHU will look like is not clear  This paper searches to find a common definition  and or features for this EHU through a systematic literature review performed in May 2021   European Union s concern about health for all  is suggested as a definition  The main drivers identified to develop an EHU are  surveillance and monitoring  crisis preparedness  funding  political will  vision of public health expenditures  population s awareness and interest  and global health  Based on these findings  five scenarios were developed  making a full move towards supranational action  improving efficiency in the actual framework  more coordination but no real change  in a full intergovernmentalism direction  and fragmentation of the EU  The scenarios show that the development of a EHU is possible inside the current legal framework  However  it will rely on increased coordination and has a focus on cross-border health threats  Any development will be strongly linked to political choices from Member States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34946467
4700,Background  The objective of the study is to describe the presentation  treatment and outcomes of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome with COVID-19  MIS-C  in a tertiary care centre in Eastern India  Methods  Retrospective data of children diagnosed with MIS-C during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic were obtained from hospital records  Clinical details  laboratory profile  treatment protocol and outcomes of children with MIS-C between 01 Nov 2020 and 30 June 2021 were analysed  Results  Ten children  7 males  with a mean age of 6 8 years  median age 5 5 years  interquartile range 3 75-9 5  were analysed  COVID-19 RT-PCR was negative in all patients  whereas the IgG COVID antibody was positive in all children  100    Seven children  7 10  had a history of contact with SARS CoV-2-positive adults  Five  5 10  children presented with cardiogenic shock  All children had evidence of a hyperinflammatory syndrome  Nine children  9 10  had predominant gastrointestinal and cardiovascular involvement  None had echocardiographic evidence of coronary dilatation or aneurysms either on admission or on follow-up  The elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio and D-dimer were found in all patients  All children responded to immunomodulatory treatment  None had residual deficit on discharge or at 4-week follow-up  There was no mortality  Conclusion  Children with MIS-C have good prognosis if early immunomodulatory treatment is instituted  Further prospective studies for long-term outcomes in children with MIS-C are required it being a novel entity recently described,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931107
9327,Ongoing pandemic and potential resurgence of Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has prompted urgent efforts to investigate the immunological memory of convalescent patients  especially in patients with active cancers  Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 3 healthy donors  HDs   4 COVID-19 patients  Covs  and 4 COVID-19 patients with active gynecological tumor  TCs  pre- and post- anti-tumor treatment  All Covs patients had recovered from their acute infection  Interestingly  the molecular features of PBMCs in TCs are similar to that in Covs  suggesting that convalescent COVID-19 with gynecologic tumors do not have major immunological changes and may be protected against reinfection similar to COVID-19 patients without tumors  Moreover  the chemotherapy given to these patients mainly caused neutropenia  while having little effect on the proportion and functional phenotype of T and B cells  and T cell clonal expansion  Notably  anti-PD-L1 treatment massively increased cytotoxic scores of NK cells  and T cells  and facilitated clonal expansion of T cells in these patients  It is likely that T cells could protect patients from SARS-CoV-2 virus reinfection and anti-PD-L1 treatment can enhance the anti-viral activity of the T cells,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862879

5894,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic necessarily changed pre-medical students  educational environment into an online format-and students  subjective happiness  SH  is highly impacted by their educational environment  This study investigates changes in pre-medical students  perceptions of their educational environment and their SH before and after the pandemic  as well as explores the predictors related to their SH  METHODS  The Korean version of the Dundee Ready Educational Environment Measure  DREEM  questionnaire and single-item measures of SH and professional identity  PI  were used  The t-test was employed to analyze the differences of the SH  PI  and DREEM subscales scores before and after the onset of COVID-19  Cohen s d was used as effect size and correlations between SH and different subscales of DREEM were analyzed using Pearson s correlation  The multiple regression analysis was performed to reveal associations between predictors and SH  RESULTS  A total of 399 pre-medical students completed the survey both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic  The DREEM scores and all subscales scores significantly increased but each presents a different effect size  Students  Perceptions of Learning  SPL  Cohen s d   0 97   Students  Perceptions of Teaching  SPT  Cohen s d   1 13   and Students  Perceptions of Atmosphere  SPA  Cohen s d   0 89  have large effect sizes  Students  Academic Self-Perceptions  SASP  Cohen s d   0 66  have a medium effect size and Students  Social Self-Perceptions  SSSP  Cohen s d   0 40  have a small effect size  In contrast  no significant change was noted in the SH and PI  Both PI and SSSP impacted SH before COVID-19  but after the pandemic  SH was impacted by SPL  SPA  and SSSP  CONCLUSIONS  Students  overall perception of their educational environment was more positive after the onset of COVID-19  but their social self-perceptions improved the least  Additionally  SSSP is the only predictor of SH both before and after the pandemic  The findings of this study suggest that educational institutions must pay attention to students  social relationships when trying to improve their educational environment  Furthermore  so as to increase students  SH  development of both educational environment and PI is essential,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34911514
4510,Vaccination is a life-saving endeavour  yet risk and uncertainty are unavoidable in science and medicine  Vaccination remains contentious in the public mind  and vaccine hesitancy is a serious public health issue  This has recently been reignited in the discussion over potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines  and the decision by several countries to suspend measures such as the AstraZeneca vaccine  In these instances  the precautionary principle has often been invoked as a rationale  yet such heuristics do not adequately weigh potential harms against real benefits  How we analyse  communicate and react to potential harms is absolutely paramount to ensure the best decisions and outcomes for societal health  and maintaining public confidence  While balancing benefits and risks is an essential undertaking  it cannot be achieved without due consideration of several other pertinent factors  especially in the context of vaccination  where misguided or exaggerated fears have in the past imperilled public health  While well meaning  over reactions to potential hazards of vaccination and other health interventions can have unintended consequences  and cause lingering damage to public trust  In this analysis  we explore the challenges of assessing risk and benefit  and the limitations of the precautionary principle in these endeavours  When risk is unclear  cautious vigilance might be a more pragmatic and useful policy than reactionary suspensions,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933928
56,SETTING  In Alberta  a small team of specialized public health experts typically complete case investigation and contact tracing  High COVID-19 case counts and a shortage of trained public health professionals required a rapid and significant adaptation of staffing models to meet the population s needs  INTERVENTION  A tiered  interdisciplinary staffing model  based on those in critical care  was developed  piloted  and implemented in the Alberta Health Services  Communicable Disease Control department in late 2020 to complete case investigation and contact tracing  The final model included novice  non-regulated professionals divided into pods of four to six investigators  led by an experienced regulated investigator  Team leads oversaw five pods  Communicable disease nurses provided an additional tier of clinical expertise  During the model development  roles and responsibilities of team members were delineated  ratios for supervision were tested  and rapid training was provided  OUTCOMES  The tiered staffing model began in November 2020 with staff members in two pods  At its peak in early May 2021  72 pods of 502 non-regulated members  134 regulated investigators  and 4 communicable disease nurses completed 780-973 case investigations daily  or 40-45  of all positive cases in Alberta  In comparison  the same number of regulated investigators working independently in the traditional staffing model without non-regulated pods completed  on average  249 case investigations daily  IMPLICATIONS  A tiered staffing model can be effective at maximizing the skills of the experienced members of the case investigation team to maintain case investigation and contact tracing activities during a pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006591
4819,Heparin  a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan  has been found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2  the causative virus of COVID-19  To elucidate the mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of heparin  we investigated the binding of heparin to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein by means of sliding window docking  molecular dynamics simulations  and biochemical assays  Our simulations show that heparin binds at long  positively-charged patches on the spike glycoprotein  thereby masking basic residues of both the receptor binding domain  RBD  and the multifunctional S1 S2 site  Biochemical experiments corroborated the simulation results  showing that heparin inhibits the furin-mediated cleavage of spike by binding to the S1 S2 site  Our simulations also showed that heparin can act on the hinge region responsible for motion of the RBD between the inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike glycoprotein  In simulations of the closed spike homotrimer  heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders opening  In simulations of open spike conformations  heparin induces stabilization of the hinge region and a change in RBD motion  Taken together  our results indicate that heparin can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by three mechanisms  by allosterically hindering binding to the host cell receptor  by directly competing with binding to host heparan sulfate proteoglycan co-receptors  and by preventing spike cleavage by furin  Furthermore  these simulations provide insights into how host heparan sulfate proteoglycans can facilitate viral infection  Our results will aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34929169
4707,INTRODUCTION  The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the magnitude of mental illnesses such as depression  not only in the general population  but also in health personnel  However  in Peru the prevalence is not known and the associated factors for developing depression in health personnel are not known  OBJECTIVE  To determine the prevalence and identify the factors associated with depression in health personnel  in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic  MATERIAL AND METHOD  An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out between the months of May-September in health establishments  A sample of 136 health workers were included and a survey was applied to collect the data  Depression as a dependent variable was measured using the Zung self-report scale  To identify the associated factors  the bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed by logistic regression with STATA v 14  RESULTS  The prevalence of depression was 8 8  CI 95   4 64-14 90   likewise  the antecedent of having a family member or friend died from COVID-19 with a p value of 0 017 and OR of 6 78  CI  1 39-32 90   On the other hand  the use of personal protective equipment  PPE  was found to be a protective factor against the development of depression with p value 0 003 and OR of 0 03  CI  0 004-0 32   CONCLUSIONS  Approximately 1 in 10 among health professionals and technicians developed depression during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in this study  In addition  the history of having relatives or friends killed by COVID-19 was negatively associated with depression and the use of PPE was identified as a protective factor for depression,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931095

2252,It is mandatory that healthcare workers wear personal protective equipment  PPE  while caring for COVID-19 patients  Studies have shown that wearing PPE for a prolonged time may lead to symptoms of physical discomfort including headache  The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence and association between prolonged use of PPE and headaches  This was a cross-sectional study  A convenience sample of healthcare workers who worked with COVID-19 patients in clinical settings was recruited  The data were collected through an electronic survey shared as a link through social media  This study included 1060 participants  753  71   female and 307  29   male  Participants were divided into two groups  Group A had 628  60   participants who did not have chronic headache before the COVID-19 pandemic  while Group B contained 432  40   participants who had a previous chronic headache  Headaches differed significantly between Groups A and B in frequency  type  location  and quality during the COVID-19 period  The analysis found a significant relationship between duration of PPE use and headache occurrence  The significant relationship between the duration of PPE usage and headache occurrence among healthcare workers should be considered when refining policies and procedures regarding prolonged PPE use,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968332
1217,PURPOSE  The COVID pandemic has greatly impacted cancer care  with survivorship care being accorded low priority  We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic on survivorship services at our centre  as well as on survivors of childhood cancer  CCS   METHODS  We analyzed the trends in survivorship care at our centre from March 2020 to June 2021 compared to previous years  We also conducted an online survey of adolescent and young adult  AYA-CCS  following up at the After Completion of Treatment Clinic  Mumbai  to assess the impact of the COVID pandemic and ensuing restrictions on our cohort of survivors  Sibling responses were used as comparator  CTRI 2020 11 029029   RESULTS  There was a decrease in in-person follow-ups and increase in remote follow-ups over the first few months of the pandemic  While in-person visits steadily increased after October 2020 and reached pre-pandemic numbers  distant follow-ups continue to be higher than pre-pandemic  Evaluable responses from the survey of 88 AYA-CCS and 25 siblings revealed new-onset health concerns in 29 5  of AYA-CCS  missed follow-up visit in 52  and varying degrees of mental health issues in 12 5   While most survivors were able to cope with the stresses of the pandemic  20  of siblings reported being unable to cope  CONCLUSIONS  Survivorship services continue to be affected well into the pandemic  with increased use of distant follow-ups  While AYA-CCS experienced significant physical  mental health issues and psychosocial concerns as a result of the COVID pandemic  they coped better than siblings during this stressful time  possibly due to multiple  holistic support systems including family  peer support groups and healthcare team,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985560
5768,BACKGROUND  Uncertainty about vaccination among nurses are major barriers to managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide  PURPOSE  To explore nurses perceptions about receiving the SARS CoV-2 vaccine to inform the upcoming Palestinian Ministry of Health  MOH  vaccination efforts  METHODS  Four focus groups were conducted with nurses between January 18 and 30  2021  before MOH launched vaccinations in Palestine  Participants working in government and private facilities were invited to participate and completed an online or paper form to provide demographics  review the study purpose  and give consent  Meetings were facilitated in Arabic either online via the Zoom platform or face-to-face using the same interview guide  Transcripts were translated into English and coded using a template analysis approach  RESULTS  Forty-six nurses  with a median age of 29 5y  range  22-57  from across Palestine participated  Three major themes emerged  uncertainty  trust  and the knowledge needed to move forward  Uncertainty related to the evolving nature of COVID-19  the rapidity of vaccine development  the types and timing of available vaccines  The need for trusted experts to share scientific information about the vaccines to counteract the misinformation in social media  Moreover  reliable vaccine information may help vaccine-hesitant nurses move to vaccine-acceptors and to convince others  including their patients  CONCLUSION  The negative perception of nurses towards vaccines is problematic in Palestine and uncertainty about which vaccine s  will be available adds to the lack of education and mass-media misinformation  Other countries with vaccination efforts that are not wholly planned or implemented and may be struggling with similar concerns,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913746
6543,Chest X-ray  CXR  images have been one of the important diagnosis tools used in the COVID-19 disease diagnosis  Deep learning  DL -based methods have been used heavily to analyze these images  Compared to other DL-based methods  the bag of deep visual words-based method  BoDVW  proposed recently is shown to be a prominent representation of CXR images for their better discriminability  However  single-scale BoDVW features are insufficient to capture the detailed semantic information of the infected regions in the lungs as the resolution of such images varies in real application  In this paper  we propose a new multi-scale bag of deep visual words  MBoDVW  features  which exploits three different scales of the 4th pooling layer s output feature map achieved from VGG-16 model  For MBoDVW-based features  we perform the Convolution with Max pooling operation over the 4th pooling layer using three different kernels   Formula  see text    Formula  see text   and  Formula  see text   We evaluate our proposed features with the Support Vector Machine  SVM  classification algorithm on four CXR public datasets  CD1  CD2  CD3  and CD4  with over 5000 CXR images  Experimental results show that our method produces stable and prominent classification accuracy  84 37   88 88   90 29   and 83 65  on CD1  CD2  CD3  and CD4  respectively,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903792
4521,Correlates of protection for COVID-19 vaccines are urgently needed to license additional vaccines  We measured immune responses to four COVID-19 vaccines of proven efficacy using a single serological platform  IgG anti-Spike antibodies were highly correlated with ID50 neutralization in a validated pseudoviral assay and correlated significantly with efficacies for protection against infection with wild-type  alpha and delta variant SARS-CoV-2 virus  The protective threshold for each vaccine was calculated for IgG anti-Spike antibody  The mean protective threshold for all vaccine studies for WT virus was 154 BAU ml  95  CI 42-559   and for studies with antibody distributions that enabled precise estimation of thresholds  i e  leaving out 2-dose mRNA regimens  was 60 BAU ml  95  CI 35-102   We propose that the proportion of individuals with responses above the appropriate protective threshold together with the geometric mean concentration can be used in comparative non-inferiority studies with licensed vaccines to ensure that new vaccines will be efficacious,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34933765
9925,BACKGROUND  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic  surgical operations have been drastically reduced in South Africa  SA   Guidelines on surgical prioritisation during COVID-19 have been published  but are specific to high-income countries  There is a pressing need for context-specific guidelines and a validated tool for prioritising surgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic  In March 2020  the South African National Surgical Obstetric Anaesthesia Plan Task Team was asked by the National Department of Health to establish a national framework for COVID-19 surgical prioritisation  OBJECTIVES  To develop a national framework for COVID-19 surgical prioritisation  including a set of recommendations and a risk calculatorfor operative care  METHODS  The surgical prioritisation framework was developed in three stages   i  a literature review of international  national and local recommendations on COVID-19 and surgical care was conducted   ii  a set of recommendations was drawn up based on the available literature and through consensus of the COVID-19 Task Team  and  iii  a COVID-19 surgical risk calculator was developed and evaluated  RESULTS  A total of 30 documents were identified from which recommendations around prioritisation of surgical care were used to draw up six recommendations for preoperative COVID-19 screening and testing as well as the use of appropriate personal protective equipment  Ninety-nine perioperative practitioners from eight SA provinces evaluated the COVID-19 surgical risk calculator  which had high acceptability and a high level of concordance  81   with current clinical practice  CONCLUSIONS  This national framework on COVID-19 surgical prioritisation can help hospital teams make ethical  equitable and personalised decisions whether to proceed with or delay surgical operations during this unprecedented epidemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852883

2354,Background  Delaying doctor consultation is harmful  Fear of COVID-19 leads to delays in seeking medical care at a time when pandemic information overflows  However  little is known about the role of COVID-19 related fear  attention to information  and fact-checking in such delay  Objective  Under the Hong Kong Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project  we examined the associations of delay in doctor consultation amidst the pandemic with sociodemographic characteristics  COVID-19 related fear  attention to information  and fact-checking  Methods  We conducted a population-based online cross-sectional survey in May 2020 on Hong Kong Chinese adults  Respondents reported whether the pandemic caused any delay in doctor consultation  yes no   level of COVID-19 related fear  attention to information and fact-checking  all on a scale of 0 to 10 and recoded into tertiles of low  moderate  high   Regression analyses were used to examine the associations of delay and fear with sociodemographic characteristics  attention and fact-checking  adjusting for covariates  Data were weighted by sex  age and education level of the population  Results  Of 4 551 respondents  46 5  male  59 7  aged over 45 years   10 1  reported delay in doctor consultation  The mean score was 6 4 for fear  8 0 for attention and 7 4 for fact-checking  Delay was more common in males and increased with age and fear  High vs  low level of fear was associated with delay  adjusted odd ratios  AOR  2 68  95  confidence interval  CI  2 08  3 47   Moderate level of fact-checking was negatively associated with delay  AOR 1 28  95  CI 0 98  1 67   Females reported greater fear and fear decreased with age  Fear increased with attention to information and decreased with fact-checking  Fear substantially mediated the association of delay with attention  96   and fact-checking  30    Conclusions  We have first shown that delay in doctor consultation increased with fear of COVID-19 and decreased with fact-checking amidst the pandemic  Fear also increased with attention to COVID-19 related information and decreased with fact-checking  Understanding these associations can help policymakers develop targeted communication and support to the public to reduce delayed doctor consultations and the associated COVID-19-related or unrelated morbidity and mortality in the community,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34966717
8522,The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and urgently demands powerful new therapeutics that can resist viral escape  We therefore generated a large nanobody repertoire to saturate the distinct and highly conserved available epitope space of SARS-CoV-2 spike  including the S1 receptor binding domain  N-terminal domain  and the S2 subunit  to identify new nanobody binding sites that may reflect novel mechanisms of viral neutralization  Structural mapping and functional assays show that indeed these highly stable monovalent nanobodies potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection  display numerous neutralization mechanisms  are effective against emerging variants of concern  and are resistant to mutational escape  Rational combinations of these nanobodies that bind to distinct sites within and between spike subunits exhibit extraordinary synergy and suggest multiple tailored therapeutic and prophylactic strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34874007
6752,In light of the swift outspread and considerable mortality  coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  necessitates a rapid screening tool and a precise diagnosis  Saliva is considered as an alternative specimen to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  since the viral load is comparable to what are found in a throat and a nasal cavity  The electrical double layer  EDL -gated field-effect transistor-based biosensor  BioFET  emerges as a promising candidate for salivary COVID-19 tests due to a high sensitivity  a portable configuration  a label-free operation  and a matrix insensitivity  In this work  the authors utilize EDL-gated BioFETs to detect complementary DNAs  cDNAs  and viral RNAs with various testing conditions such as switches of probes  temperature treatments  and matrices  The selectivity is confirmed with cDNA and noncomplementary DNA  ncDNA   exhibiting an eightfold difference in electrical signals  The matrix insensitivity is evaluated  and BioFETs successfully validate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-gene RNA down to 1 fm in diluted human saliva with a 95 degrees C- and a 25 degrees C-treatment  respectively  This proposed system has a high potential to be deployed for an on-site COVID-19 screening  improving the disease control and benefitting frontline healthcare system,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901383

3949,Strongyloides stercoralis  causative agent of a neglected tropical disease  is a soil-transmitted helminth which may cause lifelong persisting infection due to continuous autoinfection  In the case of immunosuppression  life-threatening hyperinfection and disseminated strongyloidiasis can develop  We propose a pragmatic screening algorithm for latent strongyloidiasis based on epidemiologic exposure and immunosuppression status that can be applied for any kind of immunosuppressive therapy  The algorithm allows the diagnosis of latent strongyloidiasis with optimal accuracy in a well-equipped setting  while for endemic settings where the complete testing array is unavailable  an empiric treatment is generally recommended  Accurate diagnosis and extensive empiric treatment will both contribute to decreasing the current neglect of strongyloidiasis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941659
5627,AIMS AND METHOD  This review aims to clarify the evidence on the effectiveness of telepsychiatry following the COVID-19 pandemic  We conducted a literature review of three databases  Cochrane Library  PubMed and PsycINFO   using the terms virtual consultation telepsychiatry video consultation AND psychiatry mental illness  RESULTS  We identified 325 eligible papers and conducted a thematic analysis resulting in five themes  patient and clinical satisfaction  diagnostic reliability  outcomes  technology and professional guidance  The most significant factors linked to effectiveness of telepsychiatry were patient and clinician satisfaction and adequate technology to facilitate examination of the patient  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS  The consistent diagnostic reliability  satisfactory clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction linked to telepsychiatry favour its continued use once the pandemic ends  The main barrier is reluctance among clinicians and lack of professional guidance  We recommend education on the uses of telepsychiatry among clinicians  and the provision of professional guidance for its use from medical bodies and organisations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915955
8,BACKGROUND  The current coronavirus pandemic  COVID-19  was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2  SARS-CoV-2   COVID-19 is characterized by atypical pneumonia  mild colds  and more severe illnesses  such as severe acute respiratory distress  thrombosis  organ failure  and various secondary bacterial and fungal infections  Notably  the severity of COVID-19 in different age groups is not well known  and the validity of clinical laboratory data remains unclear  METHODS  In this retrospective cross-sectional study  we examined differential regulation of clinical  hematologic  and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients  We divided 104 COVID-19 patients into five different groups according to age  0-17  18-45  46-65  66-79  and >80 years   Baseline data  sex  comorbidities  intensive care admission  and medications   hematologic markers  liver  and renal function tests  coagulation  and inflammatory markers were examined in these groups  Receiver operator characteristic  ROC  analysis was used to determine the optimal threshold for predicting COVID-19 biological markers  RESULTS  We found that the highest percentage  45   of COVID-19 patients was in the age group of 46-65 years  The hematologic parameters  WBC  HB  and PLT  were normal between the patient groups  The area under the curve in ROC analysis showed significant differences in the levels of creatine  GGT  BUN  CRP  D-dimer  ferritin  AST  and procalcitonin between the patients of age groups 46-65 and 66-79 years  Renal biomarkers were significantly high in most patients  regardless of age  In contrast  the liver biomarkers  did not differ significantly between patient groups  CONCLUSION  The main finding of our study is that laboratory parameters such as GGT  creatinine  BUN  CRP  procalcitonin  ferritin and D-dimer were differentially regulated in COVID -19 patients of different age groups  Importantly  these laboratory parameters may help as clinical predictors to assess the severity of the disease in the population  We conclude here that age is an important factor influencing COVID-19 severity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007842
2840,The World Health Organization has identified vaccine hesitancy as a top health concern  Emerging research shows that those who are hesitant may still get vaccinated  however  little is known about those who say they are hesitant but still get vaccinated  Most people have high trust in several sources of COVID-19 information  and trust in certain information sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health care providers was associated with being vaccinated  This study explored trusted information sources among hesitant adopters in the United States with a survey respondents completed while waiting after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine dose  The study included  n   867  respondents  The majority of respondents were female  60 21    were between the ages of 18 and 44 years old  71 97    and were diverse  with most identifying as White  44 54   or Hispanic Latinx  32 55    Hesitant adopters reported multiple trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information  which can be grouped into four emergent subthemes   1  Health care Medical science   2  Personal relationships   3  News and social media  and  4  Individual Myself  Some respondents expressed a distrust of all sources of COVID-19 vaccine information  despite receiving the vaccine  describing a lack of trust in traditional sources of information such as the mainstream media or government  This study contributes to the literature by documenting trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information among hesitant adopters in the United States  Findings provide important insights about respondents  trusted sources of COVID-19 vaccine information that can inform future public health messaging campaigns intended to increase vaccine uptake among hesitant adopters,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960164
7116,PURPOSE  To evaluate the diagnostic value of symptoms used by daycares and schools to screen children and adolescents for SARS-CoV-2 infection  we analyzed data from a primary care setting  METHODS  This cohort study included all patients <  17 years old who were evaluated at Providence Community Health Centers  PCHC  Providence  U S    for COVID-19 symptoms and or exposure  and received SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction  PCR  testing between March-June 2020  Participants were identified from PCHC electronic medical records  For three age groups- 0-4  5-11  and 12-17 years-we estimated the sensitivity  specificity  and area under the receiver operating curve  AUC  of individual symptoms and three symptom combinations  a case definition published by the Rhode Island Department of Health  RIDOH   and two novel combinations generated by different statistical approaches to maximize sensitivity  specificity  and AUC  We evaluated symptom combinations both with and without consideration of COVID-19 exposure  Myalgia  headache  sore throat  abdominal pain  nausea  anosmia  and ageusia were not assessed in 0-4 year-olds due to the lower reliability of these symptoms in this group  RESULTS  Of 555 participants  217  39 1   were SARS-CoV-2-infected  Fever was more common among 0-4 years-olds  p   0 002   older children more frequently reported fatigue  p   0 02   In children >  5 years old  anosmia or ageusia had 94-98  specificity  In all ages  exposure history most accurately predicted infection  With respect to individual symptoms  cough most accurately predicted infection in <5 year-olds  AUC 0 69  and 12-17 year-olds  AUC 0 62   while headache was most accurate in 5-11 year-olds  AUC 0 62   In combination with exposure history  the novel symptom combinations generated statistically to maximize test characteristics had sensitivity >95  but specificity <30   No symptom or symptom combination had AUC >  0 70  CONCLUSIONS  Anosmia or ageusia in children >  5 years old should raise providers  index of suspicion for COVID-19  However  our overall findings underscore the limited diagnostic value of symptoms,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898635
491,PURPOSE  To evaluate the usefulness of compressive ultrasound  CUS  for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis  DVT  in patients with SARS-CoV-2-related infection  METHODS  112 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively enrolled  CUS was performed within 2 days of admission and consisted in the assessment of the proximal and distal deep venous systems  Lack of compressibility  or direct identification of an endoluminal thrombus  were the criteria used for the diagnosis of DVT  Pulmonary embolism  PE  events were investigated at computed tomography pulmonary angiography  CTPA  within 5 days of follow-up  Logistic binary regression was computed to determine which clinical and radiological parameters were independently associated with PE onset  RESULTS  Overall  the incidence of DVT in our cohort was about 43   The most common district involved was the left lower limb  68 7   in comparison with the right one  58 3   while the upper limbs were less frequently involved  4 2  the right one and 2 1  the left one  respectively   On both sides  the distal tract of the popliteal vein was the most common involved  50  right side and 45 8  left side   The presence of DVT in the distal tract of the right popliteal vein  OR   2 444 95 CIs 1 084-16 624  p   0 038   in the distal tract of the left popliteal vein  OR   4 201 95 CIs 1 484-11 885  p   0 007   and D-dimer values  OR   2 122 95 CIs 1 030-5 495  p   0 003  were independently associated with the onset on PE within 5 days  CONCLUSIONS  CUS should be considered a useful tool to discriminate which category of patients can develop PE within 5 days from admission,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000130
7197,Since the Coronavirus 19  COVID-19  pandemic  several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  SARS-CoV-2 VOC  have been reported  The B 1 1 7 variant has been associated with increased mortality and transmission risk  Furthermore  cluster and possible co-infection cases could occur in the next influenza season or COVID-19 pandemic wave  warranting efficient diagnosis and treatment decision making  Here  we aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR developed on the LabTurbo AIO 48 open system  We performed a multicenter study to evaluate the performance and analytical sensitivity of the LabTurbo AIO 48 system for SARS-CoV-2  influenza A B  and respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  using 652 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples from patients  The LabTurbo AIO 48 system demonstrated a sensitivity of 9 4 copies per PCR for N2 of SARS-CoV-2  24 copies per PCR for M of influenza A and B  and 24 copies per PCR for N of RSV  The assay presented consistent performance in the multicenter study  The multiplex RT-PCR applied on the LabTurbo AIO 48 open platform provided highly sensitive  robust  and accurate results and enabled high-throughput detection of B 1 1 7  influenza A B  and RSV with short turnaround times  Therefore  this automated molecular diagnostic assay could enable streamlined testing if COVID-19 becomes a seasonal disease,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34897035
1226,In December 2019  a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  started spreading worldwide causing the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic  The hyperactivation of the immune system has been proposed to account for disease severity and death in COVID-19 patients  Despite several approaches having been tested  no therapeutic protocol has been approved  Given that Cyclosporine A  CsA  is well-known to exert a strong antiviral activity on several viral strains and an anti-inflammatory role in different organs with relevant benefits in diverse pathological contexts  we tested its effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells  We found that treatment with CsA either before or after infection of CaLu3 cells by three SARS-CoV-2 variants   i  reduces the expression of both viral RNA and proteins in infected cells   ii  decreases the number of progeny virions released by infected cells   iii  dampens the virus-triggered synthesis of cytokines  including IL-6  IL-8  IL1alpha and TNF-alpha  that are involved in cytokine storm in patients  Altogether  these data provide a rationale for CsA repositioning for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients  IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 is the most recently identified member of the betacoronavirus genus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic  Repurposing of available drugs has been a  quick and dirty  approach to try to reduce mortality and severe symptoms in affected patients initially  and can still represent an undeniable and valuable approach to face COVID-19 as the continuous appearance and rapid diffusion of more  aggressive  transmissible variants  capable of eluding antibody neutralization  challenges the effectiveness of some anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines  Here  we tested a known antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug  Cyclosporine A  CsA   and found that it dampens viral infection and cytokine release from lung cells upon exposure to three different SARS-CoV-2 variants  Knock down of the main intracellular target of CsA  Cyclophilin A  does not phenocopy the drug inhibition of viral infection  Altogether  these findings shed new light on the cellular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide the rationale for CsA repositioning to treat severe COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34985303
4587,INTRODUCTION  Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has led to radical changes in social distancing awareness and affected social relationships  Owing to large-scale lockdown  home quarantine and social distancing requirements  it was anticipated that sexual activities would be severely impacted  However  retrospective self-report studies showed that pornography use and autoerotism increased during the pandemic  AIM  This study used big-data databases available on the Internet to investigate factors that modulated pornography use during the pandemic  METHODS  Daily relative search volume  RSV  data from Google Trends for the period from 24 February 2020 to 13 July 2020 were extracted  Pornhub traffic data were extracted from the Pornhub Insights website  for the period from 24 February 2020 to 13 July 2020  The parameter was defined as  percent change in traffic compared to an average day in 2019   The number of daily new cases of COVID-19 was extracted from the database on Our World in Data  OUTCOME MEASURES  The normality of the data was examined using the Shapiro-Wilk test  All variables included in this study were non-normally distributed  Therefore  non-parametric tests or parametric tests with bootstrapping were adopted where appropriate  RESULTS  According to Google Trends  the RSV for  pornography  increased after late March 2020  which is close to the date when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic  The number of daily new cases of COVID-19 was positively correlated with the traffic of Pornhub  a popular pornography website  and the RSV for  pornography   Moderation analysis demonstrated a significant main effect of daily new cases of COVID-19 and the RSV for  social distancing  in predicting Pornhub traffic RSV for  pornography   Furthermore  the RSV for  social distancing  significantly moderated the relationship between daily new cases and Pornhub traffic RSV for  pornography   A stronger COVID-pornography use association was observed with increased social distancing awareness  CONCLUSION  Increased pornography consumption during the pandemic was observed  and it was associated with the severity of the pandemic  Social distancing awareness could be a key factor influencing interest in and use of pornography  Further studies on the changes in sexual desire and birth-rate control are worthwhile because long-term public health may be affected by the changes in sexual behaviour during the pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932564
9137,The inflammation and activation of the immune system induced by SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by a pro-oxidant microenvironment that can induce cytotoxic effects that enhance tissue damage  favoring organic deterioration  We investigated whether the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation by COVID-19 infection could inhibit mitochondrial function and cause cellular damage in leukocytes  We evaluated levels of oxidative inflammation markers and their correlation with mitochondrial function and leukocyte cell death in COVID-19 patients at two moments  viremia and severe sepsis with multi-organ failure  COVID-19 induces increased oxidative stress and inflammation markers that activate cellular damage processes  In the viremia stage  an increase in peroxide  nitric oxide  carbonylated proteins  and IL-6 was observed  which was correlated with a marked inhibition of mitochondrial function  decreased cell viability  early apoptosis  necrosis  and leukocytes-reactivity  The severe sepsis stage with multi-organ failure also showed a further increase in levels of peroxide  carbonylated proteins  and IL-6  with a slight decrease in nitric oxide  This oxidative process and inflammation were correlated with less inhibition of mitochondrial function  decreased cell viability and an increase in late apoptosis  and morphology changes evidencing damage in the leukocytes  SARS-CoV-2 induced damage promotes levels of oxidative stress and inflammation markers and mitochondrial dysfunction that potentiate morphological changes and cell death in leukocytes  These processes explain the rapid changes in the immune system  and that present an initial over-activation and early massive death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection  promoting endothelial-alveolar damage that would cause multi-organ failure  sustained by oxidative stress and inflammation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866537

5638,BACKGROUND  Difficulties accessing health care services can result in delaying in seeking and obtaining treatment  Although these difficulties are disproportionately experienced among vulnerable groups  we know very little about how the intersectionality of realities experienced by immigrants and visible minorities can impact their access to health care services since the pandemic  METHODS  Using Statistics Canada s Crowdsourcing Data  Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Experiences of Discrimination  we combine two variables  i e   immigrant status and visible minority status  to create a new variable called visible minority immigrant status  This multiplicative approach is commonly used in intersectionality research  which allows us to explore disadvantages experienced by minorities with multiplicative identities  RESULTS  Main results show that  compared to white native-born  visible minority immigrants are less likely to report difficulties accessing non-emergency surgical care  OR   0 55  p < 0 001   non-emergency diagnostic test  OR   0 74  p < 0 01   dental care  OR   0 71  p < 0 001   mental health care  OR   0 77  p < 0 05   and making an appointment for rehabilitative care  OR   0 56  p < 0 001  but more likely to report difficulties accessing emergency services urgent care  OR   1 46  p < 0 05   CONCLUSION  We conclude that there is a dynamic interplay of factors operating at multiple levels to shape the impact of COVID-19 related needs to be addressed through changes in social policies  which can tackle unique struggles faced by visible minority immigrants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34915891
5090,Objective  To understand the current situation of stigmatizing attitudes toward Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  in China and compare it with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  AIDS   Methods  Convenient sampling and vignette-based methods were used to recruit participants on WeChat  A demographic form and adopted stigma scale were used to collect participants  demographic information and stigmatizing attitudes toward COVID-19 and AIDS  Results  A total of 13 994 questionnaires were included in this study  A high portion of participants tend to avoid contact with individuals affected with COVID-19  74 3   or AIDS  59 0    as well as their family members  70 4  for COVID-19 and 47 9  for AIDS   About half of the participants agreed that affected persons could not only cause problems to their own family but also have adverse effects on others  59 6  and 55 6  for COVID-19  56 9 and 47 0  for AIDS   The agreements with statements about perceived stigma were similar but slightly higher than those about personal stigma in both COVID-19 and AIDS  Participants  agreements with all statements regarding personal and perceived stigma attitudes between COVID-19 and AIDS were all statistically significant  p < 0 001   Participants obtained COVID-19-related information mainly from social media  91 3   and newspaper or television  77 1   during the epidemic  and 61 0  of them thought information from newspapers or television was the most reliable  Conclusion  Several similarities and differences of people s attitude toward COVID-19 and AIDS were found  Avoidance  blame  and secondary discrimination to diagnosed persons and their surrounding persons were the main representations of COVID-19-related stigma  Stigma of COVID-19 had less moral link but more public panic  Experience from HIV-related stigma reduction and prevention can be applied to reduce COVID-19-related stigma,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925108
2944,OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Radiological Society of North America  RSNA  classification system for coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pneumonia compared to pre-pandemic chest computed tomography  CT  scan images to mitigate the risk of bias regarding the reference standard  MATERIALS AND METHODS  This was a retrospective  cross-sectional  diagnostic test accuracy study  Chest CT scans  carried out from May 1 to June 30  2020  and from May 1 to July 17  2017  were consecutively selected for the COVID-19  positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR  for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 result  and control  pre-pandemic  groups  respectively  Four expert thoracic radiologists blindly interpreted each CT scan image  Sensitivity and specificity were calculated  RESULTS  A total of 160 chest CT scan images were included  79 in the COVID-19 group  56  43 5-67  years old  41 men  and 81 in the control group  62  52-72  years old  44 men   Typically  an estimated specificity of 98 5   95  confidence interval  CI  98 1 -98 4   was obtained  For the indeterminate classification as a diagnostic threshold  an estimated sensitivity of 88 3   95  CI 84 7 -91 7   and a specificity of 79 0   95  CI 74 5 -83 4    with an area under the curve of 0 865  95  CI 0 838-0 895   were obtained  CONCLUSION  The RSNA classification system shows strong diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 pneumonia  even against pre-pandemic controls  It can be an important aid in clinical decision-making  especially when a typical or indeterminate pattern is found  possibly advising retesting following an initial negative RT-PCR result and streamlining early management and isolation,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958741
3146,Great progress has been made over the past 18 months in scientific understanding of the biology  epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2  Extraordinary advances have been made in vaccine development and the execution of clinical trials of possible therapies  However  uncertainties remain  and this review assesses these in the context of virus transmission  epidemiology  control by social distancing measures and mass vaccination and the effect on all of these on emerging variants  We briefly review the current state of the global pandemic  focussing on what is  and what is not  well understood about the parameters that control viral transmission and make up the constituent parts of the basic reproductive number R 0  Major areas of uncertainty include factors predisposing to asymptomatic infection  the population fraction that is asymptomatic  the infectiousness of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic individuals  the contribution of viral transmission of such individuals and what variables influence this  The duration of immunity post infection and post vaccination is also currently unknown  as is the phenotypic consequences of continual viral evolution and the emergence of many viral variants not just in one location  but globally  given the high connectivity between populations in the modern world  The pattern of spread of new variants is also examined  We review what can be learnt from contact tracing  household studies and whole-genome sequencing  regarding where people acquire infection  and how households are seeded with infection since they constitute a major location for viral transmission  We conclude by discussing the challenges to attaining herd immunity  given the uncertainty in the duration of vaccine-mediated immunity  the threat of continued evolution of the virus as demonstrated by the emergence and rapid spread of the Delta variant  and the logistics of vaccine manufacturing and delivery to achieve universal coverage worldwide  Significantly more support from higher income countries  HIC  is required in low- and middle-income countries over the coming year to ensure the creation of community-wide protection by mass vaccination is a global target  not one just for HIC  Unvaccinated populations create opportunities for viral evolution since the net rate of evolution is directly proportional to the number of cases occurring per unit of time  The unit for assessing success in achieving herd immunity is not any individual country  but the world,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956588
2707,PURPOSE  The chest radiograph  CXR  is among the most widely used investigations in coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  patients  Little is known about its predictive role on the long-term outcome  The purpose of this study was to explore its association with the short and long-term outcome in COVID-19 patients  METHODS  A total of 1530 patients were assessed for the presence  radiographic pattern and distribution of lung lesions observed on baseline chest radiographs obtained at admission  The Brixia scoring system was applied for semiquantitative assessment of lesion severity  Short-term outcome was determined by clinical severity  duration of hospitalization and mortality  The 1415 survivors in this group were assessed after 5-6 months for the presence of residual symptoms  RESULTS  About 67  patients had an abnormal baseline CXR  Bilateral involvement with a basal preponderance was observed and ground-glass opacification was the most frequent finding  The Brixia score ranged from 0 to 16  median 2  interquartile range  IQR   0-6   About 36  patients were symptomatic on 5-6-month follow-up  with fatigability being the commonest symptom  A good correlation was observed between the CXR score and disease severity as well as duration of hospitalization  On multivariate analysis  the CXR score was found to be a significant independent predictor of in-patient mortality as well as presence of long-term residual symptoms in survivors  CONCLUSIONS  Disease severity as seen on the chest radiograph appears to play an important role in driving the short and long-term consequences of COVID-19 and could serve as a prognostic indicator  which influences short-term management and long-term follow-up,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961400
9714,Remdesivir  REM  is the first antiviral drug  Veklury  approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the therapy of COVID-19  Due to its poor water solubility  the preparation of Veklury requires a suitable solubilizing excipient at pH 2 conditions  For this purpose  the final formulation contains the randomly substituted sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin  SBEbetaCD  as a complexing agent  Herein  extensive NMR spectroscopic study with various cyclodextrin  CD  derivatives were conducted to understand the interactions in SBEbetaCD - REM systems at the molecular level  The pKa value of REM has been determined experimentally for the first time  as the protonation state of the aminopyrrolo-triazine moiety can play a key role in CD-REM inclusion complex formation as SBEbetaCD has permanent negative charges  The UV-pH titration experiments yielded a pKa of 3 56  thus the majority of REM bears a positive charge at pH 2 0  NMR experiments were performed on beta- and gammaCD derivatives to determine complex stabilities  stoichiometries and structures  The stability constants were determined by nonlinear curve fitting based on  1 H NMR titrations at pH 2 0  while Job s method was used to determine the stoichiometries  betaCD complexes were one order of magnitude more stable than their gammaCD counterparts  Sulfobutylation resulted in a significant increase in stability and the single isomer derivatives showed unexpectedly high stability values  logK   4 35 for REM - per-6-SBEbetaCD   In the case of betaCDs  the ethylbutyl-moiety plays a key role in complexation immersing into the betaCD cavity  while the phenoxy-moiety overtakes and drives the inclusion of REM in the case of gammaCDs  This is the first comprehensive study of REM-CD complexation  allowing the design of new CD derivatives with tailored stabilities  thereby aiding the formulation or production and even the analytical characterization of REM,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856493

9620,The within-host viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to a person s infectiousness are not well understood  This limits our ability to quantify the impact of interventions on viral transmission  Here  we develop viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and fit them to data to estimate key within-host parameters such as the infected cell half-life and the within-host reproductive number  We then develop a model linking viral load  VL  to infectiousness and show a person s infectiousness increases sublinearly with VL and that the logarithm of the VL in the upper respiratory tract is a better surrogate of infectiousness than the VL itself  Using data on VL and the predicted infectiousness  we further incorporated data on antigen and RT-PCR tests and compared their usefulness in detecting infection and preventing transmission  We found that RT-PCR tests perform better than antigen tests assuming equal testing frequency  however  more frequent antigen testing may perform equally well with RT-PCR tests at a lower cost but with many more false-negative tests  Overall  our models provide a quantitative framework for inferring the impact of therapeutics and vaccines that lower VL on the infectiousness of individuals and for evaluating rapid testing strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857628
3469,Mandatory 14-day hotel COVID-19 quarantine was introduced for international arrivals into Australia in late March 2020  with no precedent and little time to prepare  This public health initiative was a key factor in Australia s relatively low COVID-19 burden in the first 18 months of the pandemic  We conducted an empirical bioethics study exploring the experience of people who had quarantined in hotels in Australia  We used in depth interviews to develop an understanding of context and normative analysis to consider whether the way the program is conducted is ethically justifiable  58 people participated  they had been in hotel quarantine in different parts of Australia in the period March 2020-January 2021  Participants faced considerable uncertainty while in quarantine and many experienced this as burdensome  Some uncertainty resulted from not being given information about key aspects of quarantine  some from rules that changed frequently or were otherwise inconsistent  some from being physically isolated  Lack of information and uncertainty contributed to diminished agency  Communication efforts made by individual hotels was well received  Earlier ethics literature about quarantine does not take into account the context our participants described  where the hotel and supervision arrangements were central to the experience  We argue that more suitable arrangements must be made if quarantine is to be an ongoing proposition,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34950927
4038,BACKGROUND  Studying the relationship between subjectively and objectively measured physical activity  PA  can provide viable information on youths  behaviors  However  the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic  which reduced children s possibilities to be active  may negatively affect it  The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between subjectively and objectively measured PA levels  light  moderate  vigorous  and moderate-to-vigorous  during COVID-19-based restrictions and after they were lifted  and to determine whether such relationships changed in these two periods  METHODS  A total of 26 adolescents  58  girls  mean age   12 4   - 0 5  wore accelerometers during public restrictions and after they were removed  Participants also completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire during the same periods  RESULTS  High significant correlations were found at all levels of PA  r   0 767-0 968  in both time periods  except for moderate PA during restrictions  Comparing the two periods  significantly higher correlations were found for moderate PA  p < 0 001  and moderate-to-vigorous PA  p   0 003  after restrictions were lifted  CONCLUSIONS  In this highly active cohort of adolescents  results emphasize the potential threat of lockdown conditions for youths  ability to accurately perceive their behaviors  with possible detrimental consequences on the short- and long-term health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940112
3781,BACKGROUND  To ensure availability of hospital beds and improve COVID-19 patients  well-being during the ongoing pandemic  hospital care could be offered at home  Retrospective studies show promising results of deploying remote hospital care to reduce the number of days spent in the hospital  but the beneficial effect has yet to be established  METHODS  We conducted a single centre  randomised trial from January to June 2021  including hospitalised COVID-19 patients who were in the recovery stage of the disease  Hospital care for the intervention group was transitioned to the patient s home  including oxygen therapy  medication and remote monitoring  The control group received in-hospital care as usual  The primary endpoint was the number of hospital-free days during the 30 days following randomisation  Secondary endpoints included health care consumption during the follow-up period and mortality  RESULTS  A total of 62 patients were randomised  31 control  31 intervention   The mean difference in hospital-free days was 1 7  26 7 control vs  28 4 intervention  95  CI of difference -0 5 to 4 2  p   0 112   In the intervention group  the index hospital length of stay was 1 6 days shorter  95  CI -2 4 to -0 8  p < 0 001   but the total duration of care under hospital responsibility was 4 1 days longer  95  CI 0 5 to 7 7  p   0 028   CONCLUSION  Remote hospital care for recovering COVID-19 patients is feasible  However  we could not demonstrate an increase in hospital-free days in the 30 days following randomisation  Optimising the intervention  timing  and identification of patients who will benefit most from remote hospital care could improve the impact of this intervention,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34945234
2110,BACKGROUND  Family members provide the majority of informal care for older adults in Sweden  Nevertheless  by providing a range of assistance  peers often emerge as a central to counter social isolation among older adults  Therefore  there is a need to know more about what informal care provision by older adults to their peers means for different groups of older adults  AIM  This study investigated the types of informal care and support that older adults provide to their peers in Sweden  and how these types of care and support are associated with demographic characteristics and social isolation  We also compared older adults who provide informal care and support with those who do not  METHOD  For this purpose  we used a national online survey named  Involuntary loneliness among senior citizens  answered by 10 044 older adults enrolled in the Swedish Citizen Panel  We adopted a mixed-method design to analyse the survey data  including free-text options  n   2155  and numerical data  Social isolation was assessed using a score built from the social loneliness items of the UCLA Loneliness Scale  RESULTS  In our population  21 5  of the older adults were providing informal care and support to their peers  Practical instrumental help was frequently offered by younger participants  <75 years   men and respondents who were less socially isolated  On a general level  the factors that were positively associated with giving informal care and support to peers were older age  being male  retired  married living in a relationship  living in an urban area big city and exhibiting greater isolation  Focusing specifically on social support shows that older participants  >80  and those experiencing less social isolation  score < 24  were more engaged in social activities  CONCLUSION  This paper is unique in exploring the informal peer-caregiver s perceptions of isolation  Data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic  this highlights the need to recognise informal care and support between older adults and to acknowledge their contributions as an essential component of Swedish civil society  especially during a societal crisis,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34970756

4671,Motivation  Building reliable phylogenies from very large collections of sequences with a limited number of phylogenetically informative sites is challenging because sequencing errors and recurrent backward mutations interfere with the phylogenetic signal  confounding true evolutionary relationships  Massive global efforts of sequencing genomes and reconstructing the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 strains exemplify these difficulties since there are only hundreds of phylogenetically informative sites and millions of genomes  For such datasets  we set out to develop a method for building the phylogenetic tree of genomic haplotypes consisting of positions harboring common variants to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for more accurate phylogenetic inference of resolvable phylogenetic features  Results  We present the TopHap approach that determines spatiotemporally common haplotypes of common variants and builds their phylogeny at a fraction of the computational time of traditional methods  To assess topological robustness  we develop a bootstrap resampling strategy that resamples genomes spatiotemporally  The application of TopHap to build a phylogeny of 68 057 genomes  68KG  produced an evolutionary tree of major SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes  This phylogeny is concordant with the mutation tree inferred using the co-occurrence pattern of mutations and recovers key phylogenetic relationships from more traditional analyses  We also evaluated alternative roots of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny and found that the earliest sampled genomes in 2019 likely evolved by four mutations of the most recent common ancestor of all SARS-CoV-2 genomes  An application of TopHap to more than 1 million genomes reconstructed the most comprehensive evolutionary relationships of major variants  which confirmed the 68KG phylogeny and provided evolutionary origins of major variants of concern  Availability  TopHap is available on the web at https   github com SayakaMiura TopHap   Contact  s kumar temple edu,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931186

1097,Background  Women living with HIV in Indonesia encounter challenging obstacles to healthcare  which is exacerbated by COVID-19  Access is difficult as there are limited numbers of poorly supported healthcare providers  Women also face significant stigma when disclosing their HIV-status  Objectives  Our main purpose is to give a voice to disempowered women living with HIV  by normalising the discussion of HIV  to empower health professionals to better understand the issues faced by women living with HIV  and develop improved treatment practices  Design  Our project was guided by a Feminist Participatory Action Research  FPAR  framework  FPAR refers to  a participatory and action-oriented approach to research that centres gender and women s experiences both theoretically and practically   It creates meaningful participation for women throughout the research process  ensuring a collective critical consciousness that challenges oppressive attitudes  beliefs  and practices that may be deeply embedded in society  Method  Purposive sampling and a thematic analysis was applied to focus group discussions with 20 women living with HIV and 20 women without HIV in Palembang  South Sumatra  Results  When women living with HIV face a difficult decision  do they disclose their status knowing that they may face stigma and even a refusal to be treated  or do they conceal their status and face not receiving the right care  In this article  we explore the stories of women living with HIV as they seek medical treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic  We show that there is no optimal solution for women as they lose whether they disclose their HIV status or not  Conclusion  Women s stories around HIV and COVID-19 intersect with conditions such as poverty and discrimination  as well as embedded gender systems  creating overlapping barriers to treatment  Government must challenge this culture by introducing a comprehensive sex and HIV education programme  This would normalise discussions of HIV-related topics  leading to improved health outcomes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987792
4350,Background  The coronavirus pandemic accelerated academic medicine into the frontline of research and clinical work  leaving some faculty exhausted  and others with unanticipated time off  Women were particularly vulnerable  having increased responsibilities in both academic work and caregiving  Methods  The authors sought to determine faculty s responses to the pandemic  seeking predictors of accelerated versus decelerated academic productivity and work-life balance  In this survey of 424 faculty from a private Midwest academic medical center completed in August-September 2020  faculty rated multiple factors both  pre-COVID  and  during the COVID-19 lockdown   and a change score was calculated  Results  In a binary logistic regression model comparing faculty whose self-rated academic productivity increased with those whose productivity decreased  the authors found that controlling for multiple factors  men were more than twice as likely to be in the accelerated productivity group as women  In a similar model comparing partnered faculty whose self-rated work-life balance increased with partnered faculty whose work-life balance decreased  being in the positive work-life balance group was predicted by increased academic productivity  increased job stress  and having higher job priority than your partner  Conclusions  While the COVID-19 pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty  pandemic placed huge stressors on academic medical faculty  some experienced gains in productivity and work-life balance  with potential to widen the gender gap  As academic medicine evolves post-COVID  leaders should be aware that productivity and work-life balance predict each other  and that these factors have connections to work location  stress  and relationship dynamics  emphasizing the inseparable connections between work and life success,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935469
144,The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has rapidly become a worldwide pandemic  On top of respiratory complications  COVID-19 is associated with major direct and indirect cardiovascular consequences  with the latter probably being even more relevant  especially in the setting of time-dependent cardiovascular emergencies  A growing amount of data suggests a dramatic decline in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction  AMI  worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic  mostly since patients did not activate emergency medical systems because hospitals were perceived as dangerous places regarding the infection risk  Moreover  during the COVID-19 pandemic  patients with AMI had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared to those admitted before COVID-19  potentially due to late arrival to the hospital  Finally  no consensus has been reached regarding the most adequate healthcare management pathway for AMI and shared guidance on how to handle patients with AMI during the pandemic is still needed  In this review  we will provide an update on epidemiology  clinical characteristics  and outcomes of patients with AMI during the COVID-19 pandemic  with a special focus on its collateral cardiac impact,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35004867

1004,Clozapine is the antipsychotic of choice in treatment-resistant schizophrenia  Serum clozapine concentration testing is essential to monitor adherence  adjust dosing  and ensure treatment safety  However  patients who are acutely unwell are frequently reluctant to undergo blood testing requiring venipuncture  Also  conventional laboratory-based measurement of clozapine plasma levels can take days  thus contributing to the suboptimal use of clozapine when it is most needed  We pioneered clozapine whole-blood point of care  POC  testing in the acute inpatient setting in the treatment of a group of actively psychotic patients receiving clozapine during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic  POC clozapine testing using automated homogenous immunoassay requires only finger prick blood sampling and is more acceptable to patients  As it produces results in minutes  clozapine POC testing serves to promptly ascertain adherence with treatment and inform therapeutic dosing  POC testing offered a more practical  less invasive  and quicker alternative to conventional methods of monitoring clozapine levels  Near immediate availability of clozapine levels expedited clinical decisions and helped ensure safe clozapine prescribing to our severely psychotic patients in a time of crisis  By facilitating patients  early safe discharge from the hospital  clozapine POC testing also reduced length of hospitalization,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34989347
3114,Objective  To examine the associations between patient struggles  health  and weight management changes during the COVID-19 pandemic  Methods  585 patients attending a publicly funded clinical weight management program responded to an electronic survey  Results  Over half of the patients reported worsened overall health  mental health  physical activity  or diet during the pandemic  Approximately 30  of patients lost >  3  of their body weight and 21  gained >  3  of their body weight between March and July of the pandemic  Reports of social isolation was associated with increased odds for weight loss in women  OR   2 0  1 2-3 3   while low motivation  OR   1 9  1 0-3 7   depression  OR   2 5  1 0-6 3   and struggles with carbohydrate intake  OR   2 1  1 0-4 3  were associated with weight gain  Cooking more at home eating less take out was associated with increased likelihood of weight loss  OR   2 1  1 1-3 9  and lower odds for weight gain  OR   0 2  0 1 to 0 97   Working from home was not associated with weight loss or weight gain  P > 0 6   Conclusion  The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with certain factors that may facilitate weight loss and other factors that promote weight gain  Thus  depending on the patient experience during the pandemic  prevention of weight gain may be more appropriate than weight loss,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956673
2984,Introduction  To date  there is limited data on the long-term changes in the lungs of patients recovering from coronavirus  COVID-19  pneumonia  In order to evaluate pulmonary sequelae  it was planned to investigate fibrotic changes observed as sequelae in lung tissue in 3-6-month control thorax computerized tomography  CT  scans of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia survivors  Materials and Methods  A total of 84 patients  mean age  67 3 years   -15  with moderate-to-severe pneumonia on chest tomography at the time of diagnosis were included in the study  of which 51  61   were males and 33  39   were females  Initial and follow-up CT scans averaged 8 3 days   - 2 2 and 112 1 days   - 14 6 after symptom onset  respectively  Participants were recorded in two groups as those with and without fibrotic-like changes such as traction bronchiectasis  fibrotic - parenchymal bands  honeycomb appearance according to 3-6 months follow-up CT scans  Differences between the groups were evaluated with a two-sampled t-test  Logistic regression analyzes were performed to determine independent predictive factors of fibrotic-like sequelae changes  Result  On follow-up CTs  fibrotic-like changes were observed in 29  35   of the 84 participants  Group 1   while the remaining 55  65   showed complete radiological recovery  Group 2   With logistic regression analysis  hospital stay of 22 days or longer  OR  4 9  95  CI  20  32  p< 0 05  and a CT score of 15 or more at diagnosis  OR  2 2  95  CI  13 5  18  p< 0 05  were found to be an independent predictor for sequelae fibrotic changes in lung tissue  Conclusions  More than one-third of patients who survived COVID-19 pneumonia had fibrotic-like sequelae changes in the lung parenchyma  These changes were found to be associated with the presence of severe pneumonia at the time of diagnosis and longer hospital stay,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957743

8403,BACKGROUND  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has prompted many changes  Revised cardiopulmonary resuscitation  CPR  recommendations were issued including increased requirement for personal protective equipment  PPE  during CPR and isolation rooms  We hypothesized that these changes might have affected transport times and distance  Accordingly  we investigated any differences in transport time and distance and their effect on patient neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge  METHODS  This retrospective study was conducted among patients who experienced cardiopulmonary arrest and were admitted to an emergency department during specific periods - pre-COVID-19  January 1 to December 31  2019  and COVID-19  March 1  2020  to February 28  2021   RESULT  The mean transport distance was 3 5   - 2 1 km and 3 7   - 2 3 km during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods  respectively  p   0 664   The mean total transport time was 30 3   - 6 9 min and 35 6   - 9 3 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods  respectively  p < 0 001   The mean activation time was 1 5   - 2 2 min and 2 9   - 4 5 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods  respectively  p   0 003   The mean transport time was 9 3   - 3 5 min and 11 5   - 6 min during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods  respectively  p   0 001   CONCLUSION  Total transport time  including activation time for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients  increased owing to increased PPE requirements  However  there was no significant difference in the neurological outcome at hospital discharge,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876368
6309,Community attitudes towards mandated vaccinations against COVID-19 vary significantly from country to country  Views on the issue are strongly held  However  in Australia opposition to vaccination is at low levels according to a leading public opinion poll  although there has been vocal opposition to  no jab  no work  directives from some  There is relative consistency in the framing of directives that designated categories of workers across a number of Australian States are required to be vaccinated to continue in their employment  especially in the health care sector  A number of challenges against such directives have been commenced in five States in Australia  However  decisions from the Fair Work Commission  the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission and the New South Wales Supreme Court have given a clear indication that in most scenarios such directives are likely to be found lawful  with precedence being given to the public health rights of the community over individual assertions of rights  in the difficult circumstances of a country still emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic  at a time when numbers of infections in New South Wales  the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria remain significant  and when Australia has not yet opened up to the world,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34907676
7323,There has been a surge in the incidence and severity of sexual assaults globally with the insurgence of COVID-19 owing to lockdown restrictions  Ekiti Sexual Assault Referral Centre  Ado-Ekiti also known as Moremi Clinic was established in June 2020 as a multisectoral response centre to this surge  Seventy-four survivors accessed medical services from June 2020 to May 2021  Adolescents made up 54 1  while the median age was 14 5 years  Only seven survivors were seen within 24 h of the event and around a quarter had follow-up visits  A quarter of survivors reported repeat episodes of sexual assault  Complications documented were sexually transmitted infections  13 5    depression  4 1   and posttraumatic stress disorder  5 4    There was a failure of contraception in 4 5  of survivors who had taken emergency contraceptive pills  For improvements in quality of care  strategies to ensure early presentation and encourage follow-up visits must be introduced,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894872
1155,BACKGROUND  Individual behavioural decisions are responses to a person s perceived social norms that could be shaped by both their physical and social environment  In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  these environments correspond to epidemiological risk from contacts and the social construction of risk by communication within networks of friends  Understanding the circumstances under which the influence of these different social networks can promote the acceptance of non-pharmaceutical interventions and consequently the adoption of protective behaviours is critical for guiding useful  practical public health messaging  METHODS  We explore how information from both physical contact and social communication layers of a multiplex network can contribute to flattening the epidemic curve in a community  Connections in the physical contact layer represent opportunities for transmission  while connections in the communication layer represent social interactions through which individuals may gain information  e g  messaging friends  RESULTS  We show that maintaining focus on awareness of risk among each individual s physical contacts promotes the greatest reduction in disease spread  but only when an individual is aware of the symptoms of a non-trivial proportion of their physical contacts    >   20    Information from the social communication layer without was less useful when these connections matched less well with physical contacts and contributed little in combination with accurate information from physical contacts  CONCLUSIONS  We conclude that maintaining social focus on local outbreak status will allow individuals to structure their perceived social norms appropriately and respond more rapidly when risk increases  Finding ways to relay accurate local information from trusted community leaders could improve mitigation even where more intrusive costly strategies  such as contact-tracing  are not possible,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34986810

9557,Humankind has suffered many pandemics in history including measles  SARS  MERS  Ebola  and recently the novel Coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2  As of September 2021  it has affected over 200 million people and caused over 4 million deaths  India is the second most affected country in the world  Up to this date  more than 38 Lakh viral genomes have been submitted to public repositories like GISAID and NCBI to analyze the virus phylogeny and mutations  Here  we analyzed 2349 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 submitted in GISAID by a single institute pertaining to infections from the Gujarat state to know their variants and phylogenetic distributions with a major focus on the spike protein  More than 93  of the genomes had one or more mutations in the spike glycoprotein  The D614G variant in spike protein is reported to have a very high frequency of >95  globally followed by the L452R and P681R  thus getting significant attention  The antigenic propensity of a small peptide of 29 residues from 597 to 625 of the spike protein variants having D614 and G614 showed that G614 has a little higher antigenic propensity  Thus  the D614G is the cause for higher viral antigenicity  however  it has not been reported to be effective to be causing more deaths,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858480
4055,BACKGROUND  When the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began  no uniform treatment and care strategies for critically ill COVID-19 patients were yet available  National and international treatment recommendations were formulated under time pressure  initially on the basis of indirect evidence from the treatment of similar diseases  In this article  we give an overview of the content  currency  and methodological quality of the existing national and international guidelines  with special attention to the care of critically ill patients  METHODS  Guidelines were identified by a comprehensive search  the included guidelines were assessed in standardized fashion with the AGREE II guideline assessment instrument and according to the AMWF rulebook criteria  and the core recommendations of the included and methodologically high-quality guidelines were compared  RESULTS  Nine of the 97 guidelines that were identified fulfilled the content criteria for inclusion  and 6 of these fulfilled the qualitative criteria  these 6 guidelines still differed  however  in the topics to which they devoted the most attention  as well as in their methodological quality and currency  The treatment strategies for patients with severe respiratory failure  lung-protective ventilation strategies and rescue measures  deviated little from established standards  Uniform recommendations were made  among other things  for the administration of dexamethasone  which was recommended in all of the guidelines for patients requiring oxygen treatment  as well as for antithrombotic drug prophylaxis and for the prone positioning of ventilated patients  Many recommendations were based on insufficient evidence  and some were contradictory  e g   those regarding antibiotic treatment or the choice between high-flow oxygen administration via nasal canula  HFNC  and noninvasive ventilation  NIV   CONCLUSION  The consultation of multiple high-quality international guidelines and guideline recommendations shared in online portals such as MagicApp are helpful sources of information for clinicians  In view of the continuing lack of strong evidence  further research on intensive care treatments is needed  aspects of ventilation  positioning therapy  and the role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation  ECMO,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34939920
1732,Efforts in the fight against COVID-19 are achieving success in many parts of the world  although progress remains slow in other regions  We believe that a syndemic approach needs to be adopted to address this pandemic given the strong apparent interplay between COVID-19  its related complications  and the socio-structural environment  We have assembled an international  multidisciplinary group of researchers and clinical practitioners to promote a novel syndemic approach to COVID-19  the CArdiometabolic Panel of International experts on Syndemic COvid-19  CAPISCO   This geographically diverse group aims to facilitate collaborative-networking and scientific exchanges between researchers and clinicians facing a multitude of challenges on different continents during the pandemic  In the present article we present our  manifesto   with the intent to provide evidence-based guidance to the global medical and scientific community for better management of patients both during and after the current pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977193
6837,Objectives To describe the implementation process  safety  and efficacy outcomes  as well as cost-effectiveness  of the first outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy  OPAT  program to utilize disposable elastomeric pumps in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the entire Gulf region  Methods This OPAT program was initiated in May 2018 and was administered through a multidisciplinary team that included the home medicine department  pharmacy department  nursing department  and the infectious diseases service  The device used was the Intermate R   Baxter  Deerfield  Illinois  elastomeric pump  After consultation with an infectious diseases physician  eligible patients were discharged home to complete the remainder of their antimicrobial treatment  which was self-administered via the elastomeric devices  Results From May 2018 to December 2019  47 patients received 55 courses of OPAT via the new program  A total of 2 869 pumps were used during that period to provide 927 days of antimicrobial therapy in the home setting  Most patients completed the program successfully with no reported significant OPAT-related complications such as catheter-related infections  Four patients were re-admitted for relapse of infections and one patient was re-admitted for colistin-induced nephrotoxicity  No mortality was reported for any patient during OPAT treatment and 30 days after program completion  Conclusions The implementation of this novel OPAT program was safe  effective  and offered significant cost-savings to our institution  The entire process was very dynamic and was centered around proper patient selection and education as well as excellent communication between patients and the entire multidisciplinary team involved in the program  We hope that these results will encourage other institutions in the region to implement similar OPAT programs to alleviate the existing bed crisis due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900504

7234,BACKGROUND  In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and following the increasing number of suspicious Covid-19 cases in Madagascar  Malagasy laboratories are overflowed mainly due to lack of human resource and available material restriction  The development and validation of rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic methods are worth of interest and high priority  The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the performances of a rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen  in comparison to Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT-PCR   METHODS  The fluorescence immunochromatographic SARS-CoV-2 antigen test StandardTM Q COVID-19 Ag Test  SD Biosensor Republic Korea  was evaluated in samples derived from patients who were examined for disease categories  Diagnostic accuracy was determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR considered as gold standard  RESULTS  A total of 200 samples were included  94 were RT-PCR positive  Median patients  age was 38 36 years  63 5   were male  Overall sensitivity and specificity of the Standard TM Q COVID-19 Ag  SD Biosensor R  Republic Korea  were 62 66   and 100    the sensitivity was significantly higher  100    in samples with high viral loads  Ct<29   CONCLUSIONS  This antigen-based immunofluorescence RDT could be the potential to become an important tool for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 particularly in situations with limited access to molecular methods particularly in rural area of Madagascar,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34896454
9683,BACKGROUND  Vaccination against COVID-19 is the key to controlling the pandemic  Parents are the decision makers in the case of children vaccination as they are responsible for them  This study aims to investigate the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for children among parents in Saudi Arabia  METHODS  This cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire  A 35-items questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms between June 6 and July 9-2021  Descriptive statistics were used to describe the participants  characteristics  Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages  Predictors of vaccination acceptance were identified using binary logistic regression  RESULTS  A total of 581 parents were involved in this study  A majority of parents 63 9  reported that they will vaccinate their children if the vaccine becomes available  Around 40  of them confirmed that they want their child to be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine  Nearly a quarter  23 9   reported that they will vaccinate their child against influenza this year  The most commonly reported reason for hesitancy was poor awareness about the vaccine s effectiveness on children  Adequate information about the COVID-19 vaccine was the most agreed cause to accept the vaccine  Having five or more children was a significant predictor for poor vaccination acceptance  OR  0 42  95 CI  0 21-0 86   p <  05   CONCLUSION  An appropriate proportion of parents are willing to vaccinate their children if the vaccine becomes available for children in Saudi Arabia  Public health awareness must be raised to gain public trust in the vaccination and the healthcare system,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856857
6069,Ignac Fulop Semmelweis  1818-1865  and Florence Nightingale  1820-1910  were two important personalities in the history of medicine and public health  They dealt with the problem of handwashing  Semmelweis is also known as the  father of hand hygiene   just in 1847 he discovered the etiology and prophylaxis of puerperal sepsis and imposed a new rule mandating handwashing with chlorine for doctors  He also tried to persuade European scientific community of the advantages of handwashing  During the Crimean War  in Scutary  Turkey   Florence Nightingale strengthened handwashing and other hygiene practices in the war hospital where she worked and her handwashing practices reached a reductions in infections  Unfortunately the hygiene practices promoted by Semmelweis and Nightingale were not widely adopted  In general handwashing promotion stood still for over a century  During current pandemic SARS-CoV-2  COVID-19  one of the most important way to prevent the spread of the virus is still to wash the hands frequently,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909488
9165,INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES  The cardiac sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly documented  We conducted a cross-sectional study in healthcare workers to report evidence of pericardial and myocardial involvement after SARS-CoV-2 infection  METHODS  We studied 139 healthcare workers with confirmed past SARS-CoV-2 infection  Participants underwent clinical assessment  electrocardiography  and laboratory tests  including immune cell profiling and cardiac magnetic resonance  CMR   Clinically suspected pericarditis was diagnosed when classic criteria were present and clinically suspected myocarditis was based on the combination of at least 2 CMR criteria  RESULTS  Median age was 52  41-57  years  71 9  were women  and 16 5  were previously hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia  On examination  10 4  9 3-11 0  weeks after infection-like symptoms   participants showed hemodynamic stability  Chest pain  dyspnea or palpitations were present in 41 7  participants  electrocardiographic abnormalities in 49 6   NT-proBNP elevation in 7 9   troponin in 0 7   and CMR abnormalities in 60 4   A total of 30 9  participants met criteria for either pericarditis and or myocarditis  isolated pericarditis was diagnosed in 5 8   myopericarditis in 7 9   and isolated myocarditis in 17 3   Most participants  73 2   showed altered immune cell counts in blood  particularly decreased eosinophil  27 3   P< 001  and increased cytotoxic T cell numbers  17 3   P < 001   Clinically suspected pericarditis was associated  P < 005  with particularly elevated cytotoxic T cells and decreased eosinophil counts  while participants diagnosed with clinically suspected myopericarditis or myocarditis had lower  P < 05  neutrophil counts  natural killer-cells  and plasma cells  CONCLUSIONS  Pericardial and myocardial involvement with clinical stability are frequent after SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with specific immune cell profiles,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866030
2589,The timing of the development of specific adaptive immunity after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection  and its relevance in clinical outcome  has not been characterized in depth  Description of the long-term maintenance of both cellular and humoral responses elicited by real-world anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is still scarce  Here we aimed to understand the development of optimal protective responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination  We performed an early  longitudinal study of S1-  M- and N-specific IFN-gamma and IL-2 T cell immunity and anti-S total and neutralizing antibodies in 88 mild  moderate or severe acute COVID-19 patients  Moreover  SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immunity was also analysed in 234 COVID-19 recovered subjects  28 uninfected BNT162b2-vaccinees and 30 uninfected healthy controls  Upon natural infection  cellular and humoral responses were early and coordinated in mild patients  while weak and inconsistent in severe patients  The S1-specific cellular response measured at hospital arrival was an independent predictive factor against severity  In COVID-19 recovered patients  four to seven months post-infection  cellular immunity was maintained but antibodies and neutralization capacity declined  Finally  a robust Th1-driven immune response was developed in uninfected BNT162b2-vaccinees  Three months post-vaccination  the cellular response was comparable  while the humoral response was consistently stronger  to that measured in COVID-19 recovered patients  Thus  measurement of both humoral and cellular responses provides information on prognosis and protection from infection  which may add value for individual and public health recommendations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34962970

6247,Background  Behavioral responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have become highly polarized  and public health initiatives often try to use different frames to influence behavior  If the polarization of behaviors is related to differences in responses to frames  then different health messages could be targeted to different groups to influence behavior  Objective  To determine whether risk preferences and susceptibility to gain loss frames have been affected by COVID-19 and whether they differ along partisan lines  Methods  Using repeated cross-sectional data from a nationally representative dataset in the United States replicating the disease outbreak scenario collected before and after the onset of COVID-19  we test whether responsiveness to the gain loss frames has changed over time and whether the responsiveness varies by political affiliation  Results  The experimental results show that the risk preferences of the U S  population is very susceptible to the framing of choices  consistent with the literature finding risk loving preferences under the loss frame and risk aversion under the gain frame  However  the experience of COVID-19 does not appear to have changed the responsiveness  nor are there significant differences between conservatives Republicans and liberals Democrats  Conclusion  Targeting different partisan groups with different risk-related message frames is unlikely to be effective at altering behaviors,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908605
3984,RATIONALE  Bordetella bronchiseptica is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infections in domesticated dogs and cats and a rare zoonotic pathogen in immunocompromised humans  With increasing numbers of people acquiring pets and spending time with them in confined spaces due to COVID-19 lockdowns  it is important to be aware of adverse health consequences brought about by this interaction  We present a case of B bronchiseptica pneumonia in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  HIV AIDS  and review key characteristics of an additional 30 cases of B bronchiseptica infections in 29 patients with HIV AIDS that were identified by literature review  PATIENT CONCERNS  A 61-year-old male with HIV AIDS who was not on antiretroviral therapy and had advanced immunosuppression with a CD4  T-lymphocyte count of 3 cells muL sought medical attention for multiple somatic issues including subjective fevers  shortness of breath  and intermittent chest pain  DIAGNOSIS  Computed tomography of the chest identified bilateral nodular opacities in the lower lobes with scattered areas of ground glass opacities  B bronchiseptica was identified in sputum culture by mass spectrometry followed by supplementary biochemical testing  INTERVENTIONS  Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated and changed to levofloxacin after susceptibility testing was completed  OUTCOMES  The patient was discharged after symptomatic improvement with levofloxacin  LESSONS  Pneumonia with interstitial infiltrates in the setting of advanced CD4 lymphocyte depletion is the most common clinical syndrome caused by B bronchiseptica in patients with HIV AIDS  and may be accompanied by sepsis  Advanced immune suppression  as well as chronic medical conditions  for example  alcoholism  diabetes  and renal failure that compromise host defenses are also commonly found in cases of B bronchiseptica infection in patients who do not have HIV infection  Reported animal contact among patients was not universal  Isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides  carbapenems  fluoroquinolones  but typically resistant to most cephalosporins,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34941094
462,BACKGROUND  We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in France and to identify the populations most exposed during the first epidemic wave  METHODS  Random selection of individuals aged 15 years or over  from the national tax register  96  coverage   Socio-economic data  migration history  and living conditions were collected via self-computer-assisted-web or computer-assisted-telephone interviews  Home self-sampling was performed for a random subsample  to detect IgG antibodies against spike protein  Euroimmun   and neutralizing antibodies with in-house assays  in dried blood spots  DBS   RESULTS  The questionnaire was completed by 134 391 participants from May 2nd to June 2st  2020  including 17 441 eligible for DBS 12 114 of whom were tested  ELISA-S seroprevalence was 4 5   95  CI 3 9-5 0  overall  reaching up to 10  in the two most affected areas  High-density residences  larger household size  having reported a suspected COVID-19 case in the household  working in healthcare  being of intermediate age and non-daily tobacco smoking were independently associated with seropositivity  whereas living with children or adolescents did not remain associated after adjustment for household size  Adjustment for both residential density and household size accounted for much of the higher seroprevalence in immigrants born outside Europe  twice that in French natives in univariate analysis  CONCLUSION  The EPICOV cohort is one of the largest national representative population-based seroprevalence surveys for COVID-19  It shows the major role of contextual living conditions in the initial spread of COVID-19 in France  during which the availability of masks and virological tests was limited,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35000580
29,The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  virus  which caused the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic as declared by the World Health Organization  has created havoc worldwide  The highly transmissible infection can be contained only by accurate diagnosis  quarantining  and exercising social distancing  Therefore  quick and massive deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing plays a crucial role in the identification and isolation of infected patients  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard for COVID-19 detection  however  it needs expertise  facilities  and time  Hence  for the ease of population-wide screening  serology-based diagnostic assays were introduced  These can help determine the prevalence of infection  understand the epidemiology of the disease  and assist in suitable public health interventions while being user-friendly and less time consuming  Although serological testing kits in markets soared  their sensitivity and specificity were questioned in reports from different parts of the world  In this article  we have reviewed 40 Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and CE-approved clinically evaluated serological kits  8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  kits  10 chemiluminescent immunoassay  CLIA  kits  and 22 lateral flow immunoassay  LFIA  kits  for their sensitivity and specificity and discussed the apparent reasons behind their performance  We observed appreciable sensitivity in the kits detecting total antibodies compared to the kits targeting single isotype antibodies  Tests that determined antibodies against nucleocapsid protein were found to be more sensitive and those detecting antibodies against spike protein were found to have greater specificity  This study was conducted to help the decision-making while acquiring antibody kits and concurrently to be mindful of their shortcomings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35007431
3860,COVID-19 was initially reported in China at the end of 2019 and soon thereafter  in March 2020  the WHO declared it a pandemic  Until October 2021  over 240 million COVID-19 cases were recorded  with 4 9 mln deaths  In order to stop the spread of this disease  it is crucial to monitor and detect any infected person  The etiologic agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2  The gold standard for the detection of the virus is the RT-qPCR method  This study evaluated two RNA extraction methods and four commercial RT-qPCR assays routinely used in diagnostic laboratories for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in human specimens from the upper respiratory tract  We analyzed a panel of 70 clinical samples with varying RNA loads  Our study demonstrated the significant impact of the diagnostic methods selected by the laboratory on the SARS-CoV-2 detection in clinical specimens with low viral loads,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34943484
1501,Blood tests play an essential role in everyday medicine and are used by doctors in several diagnostic procedures  Moreover  this data is multivariate - and often some diseases  such as COVID-19  could have different symptom manifestations and outcomes  This study proposes a method of extracting useful information from blood tests using UMAP technique - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction combined with DBSCAN clustering and statistical approaches  The analysis performed here indicates several clusters of infection prevalence varying between 2 -37   showing that our procedure is indeed capable of finding different patterns  A possible explanation is that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory infection but a systemic disease with critical hematological implications  primarily on white-cell fractions  as indicated by relevant statistical test p -values in the range of 0 03-0 1  The novel analysis procedure proposed could be adopted in other data-sets of different illnesses to help researchers to discover new patterns of data that could be used in various diseases and contexts,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981033
7798,This study tried to determine the fear and tolerance of uncertainty levels of the parents of children hospitalized with COVID-19  and their satisfaction with the health care received during this time  Data were collected from 130 literate parents  A significant difference was found between the mean scores on the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale  IUS-12  and the age of the parents and the presence of COVID-19 in other family members and the IUS-12  Also  a significant correlation was found between parents  fear of COVID-19 and IUS-12 scores  Parents had good levels of satisfaction with health care received and moderate fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty levels  As parents  fear of COVID-19 increased  intolerance of uncertainty increased  The demographic characteristics  levels of fear of COVID-19  and intolerance of uncertainty did not affect the satisfaction levels,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34886731
3422,People with COVID-19 might have sustained postinfection sequelae  Known by a variety of names  including long COVID or long-haul COVID  and listed in the ICD-10 classification as post-COVID-19 condition since September  2020  this occurrence is variable in its expression and its impact  The absence of a globally standardised and agreed-upon definition hampers progress in characterisation of its epidemiology and the development of candidate treatments  In a WHO-led Delphi process  we engaged with an international panel of 265 patients  clinicians  researchers  and WHO staff to develop a consensus definition for this condition  14 domains and 45 items were evaluated in two rounds of the Delphi process to create a final consensus definition for adults  post-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection  usually 3 months from the onset  with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis  Common symptoms include  but are not limited to  fatigue  shortness of breath  and cognitive dysfunction  and generally have an impact on everyday functioning  Symptoms might be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness  Symptoms might also fluctuate or relapse over time  A separate definition might be applicable for children  Although the consensus definition is likely to change as knowledge increases  this common framework provides a foundation for ongoing and future studies of epidemiology  risk factors  clinical characteristics  and therapy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34951953
9691,The spike protein  S-protein  of SARS-CoV-2  the protein that enables the virus to infect human cells  is the basis for many vaccines and a hotspot of concerning virus evolution  Here  we discuss the outstanding progress in structural characterization of the S-protein and how these structures facilitate analysis of virus function and evolution  We emphasize the differences in reported structures and that analysis of structure-function relationships is sensitive to the structure used  We show that the average residue solvent exposure in nearly complete structures is a good descriptor of open vs closed conformation states  Because of structural heterogeneity of functionally important surface-exposed residues  we recommend using averages of a group of high-quality protein structures rather than a single structure before reaching conclusions on specific structure-function relationships  To illustrate these points  we analyze some significant chemical tendencies of prominent S-protein mutations in the context of the available structures  In the discussion of new variants  we emphasize the selectivity of binding to ACE2 vs prominent antibodies rather than simply the antibody escape or ACE2 affinity separately  We note that larger chemical changes  in particular increased electrostatic charge or side-chain volume of exposed surface residues  are recurring in mutations of concern  plausibly related to adaptation to the negative surface potential of human ACE2  We also find indications that the fixated mutations of the S-protein in the main variants are less destabilizing than would be expected on average  possibly pointing toward a selection pressure on the S-protein  The richness of available structures for all of these situations provides an enormously valuable basis for future research into these structure-function relationships,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856799
7415,In this review we bring together evidence that  i  RNA viruses are a cause of chromosomal instability and micronuclei  MN    ii  those individuals with high levels of lymphocyte MN have a weakened immune response and are more susceptible to RNA virus infection and  iii  both RNA virus infection and MN formation can induce inflammatory cytokine production  Based on these observations we propose a hypothesis that those who harbor elevated frequencies of MN within their cells are more prone to RNA virus infection and are more likely  through combined effects of leakage of self-DNA from MN and RNA from viruses  to escalate pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase  cGAS   stimulator of interferon genes  STING  and the Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype  SASP  mechanisms to an extent that is unresolvable and therefore confers high risk of causing tissue damage by an excessive and overtly toxic immune response  The corollaries from this hypothesis are  i  those with abnormally high MN frequency are more prone to infection by RNA viruses   ii  the extent of cytokine production and pro-inflammatory response to infection by RNA viruses is enhanced and possibly exceeds threshold levels that may be unresolvable in those with elevated MN levels in affected organs   iii  reduction of MN frequency by improving nutrition and life-style factors increases resistance to RNA virus infection and moderates inflammatory cytokine production to a level that is immunologically efficacious and survivable,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34893160
7348,During the COVID-19 pandemic  face masks became a common type of litter invading many different environments  including tourist beaches  However  the presence of face masks on beaches threatens the marine environment with a new form of plastic pollution  In this study  we monitored the occurrence and density of face masks on five tourist beaches along the Moroccan Mediterranean during five months starting from February until June 2021  A total of 321 face masks were recorded on the five beaches  96 27  of which were single use  The mean density of face masks was 0 0012   - 0 0008 m -2   Recreational beaches were the most polluted in the study area  This is related to the important influx of beachgoers on urban beaches compared to resort beaches  With the large number of masks introduced on the beach  we hypothesize that microplastic pollution could increase drastically in the Moroccan Mediterranean in the coming years  Significant efforts are required to reduce this type of waste,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894579
9713,The Covid-19 pandemic is of zoonotic origin  and many other emerging infections of humans have their origin in an animal host population  We review the challenges involved in modelling the dynamics of wildlife-human interfaces governing infectious disease emergence and spread  We argue that we need a better understanding of the dynamic nature of such interfaces  the underpinning diversity of pathogens and host-pathogen association networks  and the scales and frequencies at which environmental conditions enable spillover and host shifting from animals to humans to occur  The major drivers of the emergence of zoonoses are anthropogenic  including the global change in climate and land use  These  and other ecological processes pose challenges that must be overcome to counterbalance pandemic risk  The development of more detailed and nuanced models will provide better tools for analysing and understanding infectious disease emergence and spread,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34856500
4228,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented risk to the global population  Maternity care in the UK was subject to many iterations of guidance on how best to reconfigure services to keep women  their families and babies  and healthcare professionals safe  Parents who experience a pregnancy loss or perinatal death require particular care and support  PUDDLES is an international collaboration investigating the experiences of recently bereaved parents who suffered a late miscarriage  stillbirth  or neonatal death during the global COVID-19 pandemic  in seven countries  In this study  we aim to present early findings from qualitative work undertaken with recently bereaved parents in the United Kingdom about how access to healthcare and support services was negotiated during the pandemic  METHODS  In-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with parents  N   24  who had suffered a late miscarriage  n   5  all mothers   stillbirth  n   16  13 mothers  1 father  1 joint interview involving both parents   or neonatal death  n   3  all mothers   Data were analysed using a template analysis with the aim of investigating bereaved parents  access to services  care  and networks of support  during the pandemic after their bereavement  RESULTS  All parents had experience of utilising reconfigured maternity and or neonatal  and bereavement care services during the pandemic  The themes utilised in the template analysis were  1  The Shock   Confusion Associated with Necessary Restrictions to Daily Life  2  Fragmented Care and Far Away Families  3  Keeping Safe by Staying Away  and 4  Impersonal Care and Support Through a Screen  Results suggest access to maternity  neonatal  and bereavement care services were all significantly reduced  and parents  experiences were notably affected by service reconfigurations  CONCLUSIONS  Our findings  whilst preliminary  are important to document now  to help inform care and service provision as the pandemic continues and to provide learning for ongoing and future health system shocks  We draw conclusions on how to enable development of safe and appropriate services during this pandemic and any future health crises  to best support parents who experience a pregnancy loss or whose babies die,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34937548
5916,BACKGROUND  The coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has led many healthcare systems to become overwhelmed  and caused many frontline providers to feel fatigued and exhausted and experience severe emotional trauma  Nurses are the largest group of the world s frontline providers and it is clear that their resilience to threatening factors is critical in the current crisis  Therefore  the purpose of this study was to determine the level of resilience in nurses working in COVID-19 centers in Iran  METHODS  A cross-sectional study was conducted with 250 nurses working at three COVID-19 centers in northwest Iran  The participants were recruited using simple random sampling  The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was used to collect the data  RESULTS  The highest level of resilience was related to spiritual influences  while the lowest was the trust in their instincts and tolerance of negative emotions  Furthermore  the level of resilience was significantly higher in nurses with better family support  p < 0 01   CONCLUSION  Given the role of resilience in nurses  mental health  it is vital to support the nursing staff in critical situations and improve their resilience by focusing particularly on psychological and spiritual support,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34911141

8269,The heterogeneity in severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases points out the urgent need for early molecular characterization of patients followed by risk-stratified care  The main objective of this study was to evaluate the fluctuations of serum metabolomic profiles of COVID-19 patients with severe illness during the different disease stages in a longitudinal manner  We demonstrate a distinct metabolomic signature in serum samples of 32 hospitalized patients at the acute phase compared to the recovery period  suggesting the tryptophan  tryptophan  kynurenine  and 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine  and arginine  citrulline and ornithine  metabolism as contributing pathways in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 with a potential link to the clinical severity of the disease  In addition  we suggest that glutamine deprivation may further result in inhibited M2 macrophage polarization as a complementary process  and highlight the contribution of phenylalanine and tyrosine in the molecular mechanisms underlying the severe course of the infection  In conclusion  our results provide several functional metabolic markers for disease progression and severe outcome with potential clinical application  IMPORTANCE Although the host defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly described  they are of central importance in shaping the course of the disease and the possible outcome  Metabolomic profiling may complement the lacking knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying clinical manifestations and pathogenesis of COVID-19  Moreover  early identification of metabolomics-based biomarker signatures is proved to serve as an effective approach for the prediction of disease outcome  Here we provide the list of metabolites describing the severe  acute phase of the infection and bring the evidence of crucial metabolic pathways linked to aggressive immune responses  Finally  we suggest metabolomic phenotyping as a promising method for developing personalized care strategies in COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878333

5538,Background  The emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 has brought dramatic impacts to the global economy  The resulting health crisis and widespread fear have triggered labor shortage problems such as high job vacancy rate and low labor participation rate  Thus  how to increase the labor supply has become a hotspot among scholars  We aimed to analyze the influences of public medical insurance system on labor health status and supply  Method  Using the China Health and Nutrition Survey five-phase panel data  the new rural cooperative medical system was taken as an example to empirically analyze the influences of public medical insurance system on the individual health status and labor supply via the panel Tobit model and panel binary Logit model  The analysis revealed the mediating effect of health status  Results  First  Public medical insurance system could significantly improve individual health status  Second  public medical insurance system will lengthen the labor supply time and elevate the labor supply rate by improving individual health status  Third  the influences of public medical insurance system on labor health status and supply vary with gender and age  Conclusion  Public medical insurance system will generate positive influences on labor health status and labor supply  Hence  perfecting the public medical insurance system is able to mitigate the negative impacts of population aging and pandemic on the labor supply,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34917537
9190,In health care  well-being is considered to be composed of multiple interacting dimensions and to regard the subjective  affective and cognitive  evaluation of these dimensions  These dimensions are often referred to as physical  psychological  and social domains of life  Although there are various disease-specific and group-specific conceptual approaches  starting from a universal perspective provides a more inclusive approach to well-being  Indeed  universal approaches to well-being have striking overlaps with dementia-specific approaches  Although many initiatives have been launched to promote person-centered care and attention for well-being in recent decades  the current COVID pandemic showed that the primary focus in  Dutch  long-term care was still on physical health  However  a well-being perspective can be a central base of care  it is a means to include positive aspects  and it can be applied when addressing problems such as challenging behavior in the sense that both are about needs  Furthermore  providing care from this perspective is not only about the well-being of frail people and their loved ones but also about the well-being and needs of the involved professionals  Increasingly  research shows the importance of the quality of the resident-carer relationship  the carer s behavior  and their well-being for improving the well-being of residents  Applying the care approaches  attentiveness in care  and relationship-centered care can contribute to the well-being of all involved stakeholders as these uphold the reciprocity of care relationships and take the values and attitudes  but also the vulnerability of those involved  into account,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34865577
1406,BACKGROUND  Health literacy is important for the prevention of COVID-19  Research in Japan shows that health literacy is related to skills in evaluating information and decision making  not necessarily limited to health information   Such basic skills are important  particularly when individuals encounter new health issues for which there is insufficient evidence  OBJECTIVE  This study aimed to determine the extent to which COVID-19 preventive behaviors were associated with health literacy and skills in evaluating information and making decisions  METHODS  An online questionnaire survey was conducted using a Japanese Internet research company  A total of 3 914 valid responses were received  The measures comprised eight items on COVID-19 preventive behaviors  health literacy items  European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire   five items on information evaluation  and four items on the decision-making process  Pearson correlations between these variables were calculated  Multivariate analyses were also conducted using COVID-19 preventive behavior score as a dependent variable  RESULTS  COVID-19 preventive behaviors were significantly correlated with health literacy  information evaluation  and the decision-making process   23   24   30  respectively   The multiple linear regression analysis results showed that the standardized regression coefficients for each were  11   13  and  18  the highest value was for decision-making skills  CONCLUSIONS  Although comprehensive health literacy is necessary for COVID-19 preventive behaviors  the skills to evaluate a wide range of information and to make appropriate decisions are no less important  Opportunities for people to acquire these skills should be available at all times  CLINICALTRIAL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982036
6114,The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  has overwhelmed a number of medical facilities as well as a few entire health-care systems  A novel issue co-incident with the expeditious deployment of specialty care units for COVID-19 inpatients is the worldwide epidemic of Candida auris infections  Since its first identification and classification in Japan in 2009  it has spread globally  This threat was predicted as C  auris has a high mortality rate  cryptic fomite spread  frequent misidentification since conventional methods do not detect it  and multidrug-resistance  Since the April 2020 warning at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States  C  auris has been delineated as an increasingly consequential source of significant nosocomial infections  emphasizing the added hazard of C  auris to COVID-19 inpatients  particularly those in intensive care units,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909239
3528,BACKGROUND  The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa  SA  created numerous supply challenges  Demand for diagnostic testing overwhelmed the capacity to deliver  We describe the utility and outcomes of a mobile laboratory staffed by non-laboratory healthcare workers and established to perform polymerase chain reaction  PCR  testing for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 at a large hospital in SA  OBJECTIVES  To describe the performance of the mobile PCR COVID-19 laboratory  The secondary objective was to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infections in the non-COVID intensive care unit  ICU   METHODS  This was a retrospective descriptive study of data from the newly established mobile COVID-19 PCR laboratory database and the non-COVID ICU database during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic  20 May - 8 August 2020  at a tertiary hospital in SA  RESULTS  The mobile laboratory received 1 113 emergency COVID-19 PCR test requests for patients with non-COVID clinical presentations  The median  interquartile range  turnaround time was 152  123 - 184  minutes  n 36   Primary outcome  20 May - 19 June  n 315   The sensitivity and specificity were 95  and 97   respectively  and the positive and negative predictive values 82 4  and 99 2   respectively  Secondary outcomes  9 June - 8 August   The prevalence of COVID-19 infections among patients admitted to the multidisciplinary adult and paediatric non-COVID ICU was 2 4   n 4 168   The mean  standard deviation  COVID-19 positive rate for the mobile laboratory during this period was 18 1   6    The prevalence of COVID-19 infections among medical staff in the non-COVID ICU was 3 1   n 1 32   CONCLUSIONS  The establishment of a mobile PCR laboratory staffed by non-laboratory healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rapid  accurate and clinically effective solution for emergency hospital admissions with non-COVID-19 presentations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34949289
4902,The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of pregnant women regarding COVID-19 while evaluating the ability of protective measures and their effects on the level of anxiety during this pandemic  Using a prospective cross-sectional survey  304 pregnant women attending prenatal polyclinics were included in our study between June 10 and July 10  2020  The mean age of participants was 29 2   - 6 0 years  The median gestational week was 25  ranging from 25 to 40 weeks of gestation  There was no significant correlation between a gestational week or complicated pregnancy and anxiety  Most participants possessed adequate knowledge and practical skills concerning Covid-19  Women with adequate knowledge were found to be statistically related to a high practice skills score and lower anxiety levels  Good knowledge levels are related to good practice skills and lower anxiety levels  Although pregnancy is not currently considered a risk factor  we believe it is vital to inform pregnant women about COVID-19 since they are naturally prone to mental problems and respiratory infections during pregnancy  Therefore  healthcare professionals should be encouraged to play an active role in this issue  replacing social media  a common source of misinformation for this target demographic Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject  The prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant women increased significantly after the declaration of human-to-human transmission and the increasingly rapid spread of COVID-19 What do the results of this study add  Pregnant women with good knowledge of COVID-19 were found to have adequate practice skills and lower anxiety levels What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and or further research  The act of informing pregnant women is essential in reducing anxiety levels and taking more accurate measures against COVID-19 because high levels of anxiety and depression can have long-term effects on maternal and foetal health  To minimise the potential for information pollution on social media  health professionals must play a more significant role in informing pregnant women and provide evidence-based information to pregnant women about the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927534
3621,The Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has resulted in significant delays and cost overrun in construction projects  The implementation of health and safety  H S  technologies is one of the most important strategies to alleviate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry and help the industry adapt to the new normal  This study aims to evaluate the adoption of H S technologies for pandemic management in the construction sector under the COVID-19 pandemic  Semi-structured interviews with eighteen practitioners engaged from construction companies and technology firms were conducted to collect their views on the driving forces and issues of the adoption of H S technologies for pandemic management in Chinese construction projects  The results reveal that the major H S technologies used included the health quick response  QR  code system  artificial intelligence  AI -powered fever monitoring  and site access control system  These technologies were reported to be effective in preventing the spread of the pandemic in workplaces  The findings of the study amplify that the pandemic may serve as an acceleration of the adoption of H S technologies in the construction sector  Other technologies  such as building information modeling  drones  AI-based safety monitoring  and robotics  however  were seldom used in the studied projects  The interviewees addressed several problems regarding the implementation of these technologies  High costs of technologies  a lack of client support  and disruptions to the normal work process were the main hurdles of the adoption of these technologies  The results indicated that the external influence factor-the COVID-19 pandemic-could considerably drive the use of H S technologies  whereas the internal influence factors-cost and compatibility of technology-might be the major barriers to technology adoption  To encourage the wider use of H S technologies in construction  the government is recommended to support the technology transformation by granting financial subsidies for costs involved in innovation adoption  Project owners may consider investing substantially in H S technologies that can strengthen their resilient and innovative ability to adapt to the post-COVID-19 landscape  The present results will be useful to industry stakeholders and researchers interested in developing H S technologies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948653
2903,Given the limited therapeutic management of infectious diseases caused by viruses  such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2  the medicinal use of essential oils obtained from Eucalyptus trees has emerged as an antiviral alternative  either as a complement to the treatment of symptoms caused by infection or to exert effects on possible pharmacological targets of viruses  This review gathers and discusses the main findings on the emerging role and effectiveness of Eucalyptus essential oil as an antiviral agent  Studies have shown that Eucalyptus essential oil and its major monoterpenes have enormous potential for preventing and treating infectious diseases caused by viruses  The main molecular mechanisms involved in the antiviral activity are direct inactivation  that is  by the direct binding of monoterpenes with free viruses  particularly with viral proteins involved in the entry and penetration of the host cell  thus avoiding viral infection  Furthermore  this review addresses the coadministration of essential oil and available vaccines to increase protection against different viruses  in addition to the use of essential oil as a complementary treatment of symptoms caused by viruses  where Eucalyptus essential oil exerts anti-inflammatory  mucolytic  and spasmolytic effects in the attenuation of inflammatory responses caused by viruses  in particular respiratory diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34959612
4016,High rates of thrombosis are present in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   Deeper insight into the prothrombotic state is essential to provide the best thromboprophylaxis care  Here  we aimed to explore associations among platelet indices  conventional hemostasis parameters  and viscoelastometry data  This pilot study included patients with severe COVID-19  n   21  and age-matched controls  n   21   Each patient received 100 mg aspirin therapy at the time of blood sampling  Total platelet count  high immature platelet fraction  H-IPF   fibrinogen  D-dimer  Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time  von Willebrand factor antigen and von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor activity  plasminogen  and alpha2-antiplasmin were measured  To monitor the aspirin therapy  a platelet function test from hirudin anticoagulated whole blood was performed using the ASPI test by Multiplate analyser  High on-aspirin platelet reactivity  n   8  was defined with an AUC > 40 cut-off value by ASPI tests  In addition  in vitro viscoelastometric tests were carried out using a ClotPro analyser in COVID-associated thromboembolic events  n   8   p   0 071  nor the survival rate  p   0 854  showed associations with high on-aspirin platelet reactivity status  The platelet count  p   0 03   all subjects  COVID-19 patients presented with higher levels of inflammatory markers  compared with the controls  along with evidence of hypercoagulability by ClotPro  H-IPF     was significantly higher among non-survivors  n   18  compared to survivors  p   0 011   and a negative correlation  p   0 002  was found between H-IPF and plasminogen level in the total population  The platelet count was significantly higher among patients with high on-aspirin platelet reactivity  p   0 03   Neither the ECA-A10  p   0 008   and ECA-MCF  p   0 016  were significantly higher  while the tPA-CFT  p < 0 001  was significantly lower among patients with high on-aspirin platelet reactivity  However  only fibrinogen proved to be an independent predictor of hypofibrinolysis in severe COVID-19 patients  In conclusion  a faster developing  more solid clot formation was observed in aspirin  non-responder  COVID-19 patients  Therefore  an individually tailored thromboprophylaxis is needed to prevent thrombotic complications  particularly in the hypofibrinolytic cluster,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34940584
265,The aim of the paper was to assess the differences in the mental distress of university students in the first and second waves of COVID-19  to compare these levels with that of the general population as well as to identify the risk factors associated with the changes in mental health  A total of 2 025 university students in core psychology courses in all years of study at the Faculty of Education at Palacky University Olomouc were approached via e-mail  Of this number of students  800 students took part in the study  divided into two groups from the spring  N   438  and autumn  N   362  pandemic waves  The data were collected online via Google Forms using a battery of questionnaires and analyzed using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test  One-Sample Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test and binary logistic regression  The results showed a high prevalence of depressive symptoms  38 4 and 51 4    significant anxiety  43 8 and 37    and high stress  19 9 and 22 9   among students in both waves of the pandemic  Depression and stress also increased significantly during the second wave compared with the first one  r   0 18  0 12  0 25  and r   0 08  0 01  0 14    Finally  university students showed significantly higher levels of mental distress than the general population in all of the variables and in both waves  r   0 42-0 86   A variety of factors influenced different aspects of mental distress in the spring and autumn pandemic waves  Emotion regulation emerged as the most significant and pervasive factor  both influencing all of the three indicators of mental distress and being a significant predictor in both waves,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002867
3161,Background  Developing an understanding of the antibody response  seroprevalence  and seroconversion from natural infection and vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will give way to a critical epidemiological tool to predict reinfection rates  identify vulnerable communities  and manage future viral outbreaks  To monitor the antibody response on a larger scale  we need an inexpensive  less invasive  and high throughput method  Methods  Here we investigate the use of oral mucosal fluids from individuals recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection to monitor antibody response and persistence over a 12-month period  For this cohort study  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  ELISAs  were used to quantify anti-Spike S  protein IgG antibodies in participants who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and regularly  every 2-4 weeks  provided both serum and oral fluid mucosal fluid samples for longitudinal antibody titer analysis  Results  In our study cohort  n 42  with 17 males and 25 females with an average age of 45 6   - 19 3 years  we observed no significant change in oral mucosal fluid IgG levels across the time course of antibody monitoring  In oral mucosal fluids  all the participants who initially had detectable antibodies continued to have detectable antibodies throughout the study  Conclusions  Based on the results presented here  we have shown that oral mucosal fluid-based assays are an effective  less invasive tool for monitoring seroprevalence and seroconversion  which offers an alternative to serum-based assays for understanding the protective ability conferred by the adaptive immune response from viral infection and vaccination against future reinfections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956206
7028,The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by misinformation  politicization of public health  and extreme differences in risk assessment  In two studies  we sought to understand factors that contribute to differences in people s understanding of the virus and associated risks  We found that conservative participants reported higher levels of acceptable risk  have lower risk estimates of activities  and endorsed more misinformation  Participants with personal health risk factors rated COVID-19 risks as higher  more reflective participants had lower acceptable risk levels  and impulsive participants endorsed more misinformation  In our second study  we also found that reflective participants were more likely to wear a mask  get vaccinated  and maintain social distancing  and that participants judged arguments about COVID-19 measures largely based on the claim rather than supporting reasons  By clarifying these individual differences  public health experts can more effectively create targeted interventions for at risk populations  and be better prepared for future outbreaks,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898844
4291,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  and seasonal influenza viruses are co-circulating in the human population  However  only a few cases of viral co-infection with these two viruses have been documented in humans with some people having severe disease and others mild disease  In order to examine this phenomenon  ferrets were co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and human seasonal influenza A viruses  IAVs   H1N1 or H3N2  and were compared to animals that received each virus alone  Ferrets were either immunologically naive to both viruses or vaccinated with the 2019-2020 split-inactivated influenza virus vaccine  Co-infected naive ferrets lost significantly more body weight than ferrets infected with each virus alone and induced more severe inflammation in both the nose and lungs than ferrets single-infected with each virus  Co-infected naive animals had predominantly higher IAV titers than SARS-CoV-2 titers  and IAVs efficiently transmitted to the co-housed ferrets by direct contact  Comparatively  SARS-CoV-2 failed to transmit to the ferrets that co-housed with co-infected ferrets by direct contact  Moreover  vaccination significantly reduced IAVs virus titers and shortened the viral shedding  but did not completely block influenza virus direct contact transmission  Notably  vaccination significantly ameliorated the influenza associated disease by protecting vaccinated animals from severe morbidity after IAV single infection or IAV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection  suggesting that seasonal influenza virus vaccination is pivotal to prevent severe disease induced by IAVs and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic  Importance Influenza A viruses cause severe morbidity and mortality during each influenza virus season  The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human population offers the opportunity to potential co-infections of both viruses  The development of useful animal models to asses pathogenesis  transmission  and viral evolution of these viruses as the co-infect a host is of critical importance for the development of vaccines and therapeutics  The ability to prevent the most severe effects of viral co-infections can be studied using effect co-infection ferret models described in this report,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936487
4309,The role of the immune system against coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is unknown in many aspects  and the protective or pathologic mechanisms of the immune response are poorly understood  Pro-inflammatory cytokine release and a consequent cytokine storm can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and result in multi-organ failure  There are many T cell subsets during anti-viral immunity  The Th17-associated response  as a pro-inflammatory pathway  and its consequent outcomes in many autoimmune disorders play a fundamental role in progression of systemic hyper-inflammation during COVID-19  Therapeutic strategies based on immunomodulation therapy could be helpful for targeting hyper-inflammatory immune responses in COVID-19  especially Th17-related inflammation and hyper-cytokinemia  Cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches including mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs   tolerogenic dendritic cells  tolDCs  and regulatory T cells  Tregs  seem to be promising strategies as orchestrators of the immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   In this review  we highlight Th17-related immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss cell-based immunomodulatory strategies and their mechanisms for regulation of the hyper-inflammation during COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34936112
2794,BACKGROUND  This study aims to investigate the extent of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine-induced antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a large cohort of Italian subjects belonging to the early vaccinated cohort in Italy  METHODS  A prospective study was conducted between December 2020 and May 2021  Three blood samples were collected for each participant  one at the time of the first vaccine dose  T0   one at the time of the second vaccine dose   T1  and the third 30 days after this last dose  T2   RESULTS  We enrolled 2591 fully vaccinated subjects  16 5  were frail subjects  and 9 8  were over 80 years old  Overall  98 1  of subjects were seropositive when tested at T2  and 76 3  developed an anti-S IgG titer >  4160 AU mL  which is adequate to develop viral neutralizing antibodies  Seronegative subjects at T1 were more likely to remain seronegative at T2 or to develop a low-intermediate anti-S IgG titer  51-4159 AU mL   CONCLUSIONS  In summary  vaccination leads to detectable anti-S IgG titer in nearly all vaccine recipients  Stratification of the seroconversion level could be useful to promptly identify high-risk groups who may not develop a viral neutralizing response  even in the presence of seroconversion  and therefore may remain at higher risk of infection  despite vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960240
7716,Introduction  There are limited reports on the mental health toll associated with the fear of spreading coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  and the associated stay-at-home orders  The goal of the present study was to characterize the self-reported stress of participants from the Kansas City Metropolitan Area  KCMA  and to examine the relation between potential for asymptomatic spread and perceived stress  Methods  This prospective convenience sample study enrolled 461 participants from May 4 to May 22  2020  Participants were consented and surveyed prior to free SARS-CoV-2 testing  Measures employed included the Perceived Stress Scale-10 and a comprehensive COVID-19 questionnaire  During the study period  testing resources were limited  In the community  only symptomatic individuals or close contacts of known positives could be tested  Our program aimed to reach those who were unable to access testing resources due to their asymptomatic status or other barriers to care  Results  Worry about asymptomatic spread was associated significantly with greater perceived stress  p < 0 001   Higher stress was reported among women  p < 0 001   Hispanic Latinx  p   0 001   non-Black  African American individuals  p < 0 001   and those reporting the presence of COVID-19 symptoms  p   0 001   Conclusions  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic  social  and health disruptions around the world  Distress is significantly related to concern over unintentionally contributing to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through asymptomatic transmission  In addition to examining outcomes like distress  future research should characterize the modifiable psychotherapeutic processes that might be targeted through intervention among those experiencing distress,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888001
290,Old forests containing ancient trees are essential ecosystems for life on earth  Mechanisms that happen both deep in the root systems and in the highest canopies ensure the viability of our planet  Old forests fix large quantities of atmospheric CO2  produce oxygen  create micro-climates and irreplaceable habitats  in sharp contrast to young forests and monoculture forests  The current intense logging activities induce rapid  adverse effects on our ecosystems and climate  Here we review large old trees with a focus on ecosystem preservation  climate issues  and therapeutic potential  We found that old forests continue to sequester carbon and fix nitrogen  Old trees control below-ground conditions that are essential for tree regeneration  Old forests create micro-climates that slow global warming and are irreplaceable habitats for many endangered species  Old trees produce phytochemicals with many biomedical properties  Old trees also host particular fungi with untapped medicinal potential  including the Agarikon  Fomitopsis officinalis  which is currently being tested against the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19   Large old trees are an important part of our combined cultural heritage  providing people with aesthetic  symbolic  religious  and historical cues  Bringing their numerous environmental  oceanic  ecological  therapeutic  and socio-cultural benefits to the fore  and learning to appreciate old trees in a holistic manner could contribute to halting the worldwide decline of old-growth forests,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002589
7428,OBJECTIVE  COVID-19 and associated morbidity and mortality has disproportionately affected minoritized populations  The epidemiology of spread of COVID-19 among pregnant women by race ethnicity is not well described  Using data from a large healthcare system in California  we estimated prevalence and spread during pregnancy and recommend a vaccination approach based on minimizing adverse outcomes  METHODS  Patients delivering at Sutter Health are tested  molecular  for COVID-19  These results were combined with antibody test results  using samples drawn at delivery  For each racial ethnic group  we estimated prevalence of COVID-19  using logistic regression to adjust for known sociodemographic and comorbid risk factors  Testing for immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M provided insight into timing of infections  RESULTS  Among 17 446 women delivering May-December  460  2 6   tested positive  molecular   Hispanic women were at 2 6 times the odds of being actively infected as White women  odds ratio   2 6  95  confidence interval   2 0-3 3   August and December were the highest risk periods for active infection  odds ratio   3 5  95  confidence interval   2 1-5 7 and odds ratio   6 1  95  confidence interval   3 8-9 9  compared with May  respectively   Among 4500 women delivering October-December  425  9 4   had positive molecular or antibody tests  ranging from 4 0   Asian  to 15 7   Hispanic   Adjusting for covariables  compared with White patients  odds of infection was similar for Black and Asian patients  with Hispanic at 2 4  1 8-3 3  times the odds  CONCLUSION  COVID-19 prevalence was higher among Hispanic women at delivery and in the last trimester than their White counterparts  Higher rates in Black patients are explained by other risk factors  Resources should be directed to increase vaccination rates among Hispanic women in early stages of pregnancy,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34892993

3127,Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  is a deadly respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  which has caused a global pandemic since early 2020 and severely threatened people s livelihoods and health  Patients with pre-diagnosed conditions admitted to hospital often develop complications leading to mortality due to acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and associated multiorgan failure and blood clots  ARDS is associated with a cytokine storm  Cytokine storms arise due to elevated levels of circulating cytokines and are associated with infections  Targeting various pro-inflammatory cytokines in a specific manner can result in a potent therapeutic approach with minimal host collateral damage  Immunoregulatory therapies are now of interest in order to regulate the cytokine storm  and this review will summarize and discuss advances in targeted therapies against cytokine storms induced by COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34956607
3592,Governments worldwide have imposed harsh restrictions for decreasing the Covid-19 pandemic and maintaining public health  Yet such limitations have impacted people s physical activity  This study examined relationships between changes in physical activity and resilience  emotions  and depression during two lockdowns in Israel  An online survey was completed twice by 135 participants during two consecutive lockdowns  The results indicate that resilience and positive emotions were higher  and negative emotions and depression were lower during the second lockdown compared to the first one-even though people spent less time performing physical activity in the later lockdown  Moreover  negative emotions significantly decreased among people who reported increased physical activity during the second lockdown  M   2 2  SD   0 9  compared to M   1 9  SD   0 8  on a scale of 1-5  and increased among those who reported a reduction in activity  M   1 8  SD   0 7  compared to M   2 2  SD   0 7    It could therefore be concluded that while the Israeli population s resilience is higher compared to other populations  who do not regularly deal with crisis situations   their increased physical activity was associated with better resilience and emotions and lower depression scores  Since lockdowns are an extreme yet often repeated phenomenon  it is important to understand the psychological implications of engaging in physical activity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34948825
2846,An in-depth analysis of first-wave SARS-CoV-2 genome is required to identify various mutations that significantly affect viral fitness  In the present study  we performed a comprehensive in silico mutational analysis of 3C-like protease  3CLpro   RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp   and spike  S  proteins with the aim of gaining important insights into first-wave virus mutations and their functional and structural impact on SARS-CoV-2 proteins  Our integrated analysis gathered 6000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and identified 92 mutations in S  37 in RdRp  and 11 in 3CLpro regions  The impact of these mutations was also investigated using various in silico approaches  Among these  32 mutations in S  15 in RdRp  and 3 in 3CLpro proteins were found to be deleterious in nature and could alter the structural and functional behavior of the encoded proteins  The D614G mutation in spike and the P323Lmutation in RdRp are the globally dominant variants with a high frequency  Most of the identified mutations were also found in the binding moiety of the viral proteins which determine their critical involvement in host-pathogen interactions and may represent drug targets  Furthermore  potential CD4    and CD8    T cell epitopes were predicted  and their overlap with genetic variations was explored  This study also highlights several hot spots in which HLA and drug selective pressure overlap  The findings of the current study may allow a better understanding of COVID-19 diagnostics  vaccines  and therapeutics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960156
6759,The assessment of human internal core temperature  T core  is relevant in many scientific disciplines  but also for public health authorities when attempting to identify individuals with fever  Direct assessment of T core is often invasive  impractical on a large scale  and typically requires close contact between the observer and the target subject  Non-contact infrared thermometry  NCIT  represents a practical solution in which T core can potentially be assessed from a safe distance and in mass screening scenarios  by measuring skin temperature at specific anatomical locations  However  the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated that these devices are not being used correctly  despite expert guided specifications available in International Standard Organization  ISO  documents  In this review  we provide an overview of the most pertinent factors that should be considered by users of NCIT  This includes the most pertinent methodological and physiological factors  as well as an overview on the ability of NCIT to track human T core  For practical use  we provide a checklist based on relevant ISO standards which are simple to follow and should be consulted prior to using NCIT for assessment of human T core  Our intention is for users of NCIT to adopt this checklist  which may improve the performance of NCIT for its ability to track T core,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34901315

6291,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the necessity for a more fundamental understanding of the coronavirus life cycle  The causative agent of the disease  SARS-CoV-2  is being studied extensively from a structural standpoint in order to gain insight into key molecular mechanisms required for its survival  Contained within the untranslated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are various conserved stem-loop elements that are believed to function in RNA replication  viral protein translation  and discontinuous transcription  While the majority of these regions are variable in sequence  a 41-nucleotide s2m element within the genome 3  untranslated region is highly conserved among coronaviruses and three other viral families  In this study  we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element dimerizes by forming an intermediate homodimeric kissing complex structure that is subsequently converted to a thermodynamically stable duplex conformation  This process is aided by the viral nucleocapsid protein  potentially indicating a role in mediating genome dimerization  Furthermore  we demonstrate that the s2m element interacts with multiple copies of host cellular microRNA  miRNA  1307-3p  Taken together  our results highlight the potential significance of the dimer structures formed by the s2m element in key biological processes and implicate the motif as a possible therapeutic drug target for COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related diseases,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34908151
6021,SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent  We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent  protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection  Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response  but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding  Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation  E802D  in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase  which was not present in pre-treatment specimens  In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a approximately 6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir  Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab  Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D  this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909781

8215,In an unprecedented collaborative effort  basic and clinical scientists have provided us with an effective COVID-19 vaccine within less than one year after SARS CoV-2 emergence  Virus or vaccine induced immunity may offer different degrees of protection against infection  transmission and pathology  disease   Immunity decides on the outcome of COVID-19  both at an individual as well as a population level  In this literature analysis  emphasis is put first on the gold standard for evaluating human antiviral immunity  data from high quality  well-designed trials centered on patient outcome as clinical endpoint  morbidity  e  g  severe COVID-19   Next  case reports or case series on humans with inborn errors of immunity  IEI  may provide unique insights into human CoV-2 immunity  Surrogate markers in blood  e  g  antibody titers  are extensively employed for the evaluation of SARS CoV-2 immunity  but are not useful  SARS CoV-2 antibody titers neither indicate local immunity in the nasopharynx respiratory tract nor do they reliably reflect systemic immunity  Systemic and tissue resident SARS CoV-2 specific effector and memory T-cells are key to immunity but cannot routinely be measured in blood  Based largely on clinical data  this literature analysis suggests that antiviral immunity against Coronaviruses including SARS CoV-2 is waning significantly over time regarding infection and transmission protection  However  in individuals who have recovered from infections with human Coronaviruses  including SARS CoV-2  or been vaccinated against SARS CoV-2  immunity is robust in its most critical quality  protection against pathology severe disease  Thus  immunologists see the glass half-full and envisage the transition of COVID-19 from an epidemic to an endemic state with semiannual peaks of incidence but  most importantly  protection from severe COVID-19 or death in the vast majority of individuals  as observed in other human Coronavirus infections,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34879413

1095,The worldwide efforts that healthcare professionals are making in the COVID-19 pandemic is well known  and the high risk of illness and death that front-line staff experience on a daily basis is a reality  despite well-defined protocols for the use of personal protective equipment  In addition  it is well known that vaccination is still faraway to be achieved worldwide and that new variants are emerging  thus additional protective measures must be explored  A prospective open-label randomized controlled clinical trial was performed on front-line medical staff from the Dr  Enrique Cabrera General Hospital in Mexico City to evaluate the effectiveness of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal rinses with a neutral electrolyzed water  known as SES  to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease among front-line  not vaccinated medical staff  A total of 170 volunteers were enrolled and equally divided in a control group and SES group  All members of the trial wore the adequate personal protection equipment at all times while performing their duties  as required by standard COVID-19 safety protocols  Additionally  the SES group participants followed a prophylactic protocol with SES  oral and nasal rinses  three times a day for 4 weeks   All participants were monitored for COVID-19 symptoms and disease in a time-frame of 4 weeks and the incidence of illness per group was registered  The relative risk of disease  associated with each treatment was calculated  The presence of COVID-19-positive cases  in the group that received the nasal and oral rinses with SES was 1 2   while in the group that did not do the SES rinses  control group   it was 12 7   P 0 0039 and RR 0 09405  95  CI of 0 01231-0 7183   The prophylactic protocol was demonstrated as a protective factor  in more than 90   for developing the disease  and without adverse effects  Nasal and oral rinses with SES may be an efficient alternative to reinforce the protective measures against COVID-19 disease and should be further investigated  The present clinical trial was retrospectively registered in the Cuban public registry of clinical trials  RPCEC  database  March 16  2021  PREVECOVID-19  RPCEC00000357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34987795
1658,Background  COVID-19 vaccines reduce morbidity and mortality  but mass vaccination faces multiple challenges leading to different vaccination rates in different countries  Malta  a small European country  has achieved a very rapid vaccination rollout  This paper presents a narrative review of Malta s vaccination strategy and its impact on the country s COVID-19 situation  Methods  Data was obtained through a literature review of Maltese newspapers and from Malta s COVID-19 government dashboard  A comprehensive summary of vaccination operations was provided by Malta s COVID-19 vaccination team  Results  Malta comprised part of the European Commission joint procurement and obtained the maximum vaccines that were eligible from all manufacturers  Four tier priority population groups were set up  with both vaccine doses  where applicable  allocated and stored for each individual  Multiple hubs were set up to simultaneously administer first and eventually second doses accordingly  To date  August 9  2021  398 128 of the population are fully vaccinated and 405 073 received the first dose  with both morbidity and mortality declining progressively as vaccination coverage progressed  Conclusion  Malta has successfully implemented a COVID-19 strategy that rapidly covered a substantial proportion of the population over a short period of time  with herd immunity reached by end of May 2021  Low population vaccination hesitancy and high vaccine doses availability were two major factors in this success,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977913
6516,The most common diagnostic method for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  infection is real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  RT-qPCR   Upper respiratory tract samples  including nasopharyngeal swab  NPS   oropharyngeal swab  OPS   saliva and lower respiratory tract samples such as sputum  are the most widely used specimens for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR  This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of different samples for Coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  detection  It was found that NPS  the reference respiratory specimen for COVID-19 detection  is more sensitive than OPS  However  the application of NPS has many drawbacks  including challenging sampling process and increased risk of transmission to healthcare workers  HCWs   Saliva samples can be collected less invasively and quickly by HCWs with less contact or by own patients  and they can be considered as an alternative to NPS for COVID-19 detection by RT-qPCR  Additionally  sputum  which demonstrates higher viral load can be applied in patients with productive coughs and negative results from NPS  Commonly  after viral RNA purification from patient samples  which is time-consuming and costly  RT-qPCR is performed to diagnose SARS-CoV-2  Herein  different approaches including physical  heat inactivation  and chemical  proteinase K treatment  methods  used in RNA extraction free- direct RT-qPCR  were reviewed  The results of direct RT-qPCR assays were comparable to the results of standard RT-qPCR  while cost and time were saved  However  optimal protocol to decrease cost and processing time  proper transport medium and detection kit should be determined,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903989
9525,Background  Individuals with cardiovascular disease are considered high risk for severe COVID-19  However  the clinical impact of COVID-19 in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  HCM  is unknown  The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with HCM  Methods  This retrospective observational study included adults with HCM and positive PCR antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 at a large urban hospital system in the New York from January  2020 to January  2021  Results  Seventy individuals were included  with a mean  SD  age of 60 1  15 1  years  39  55 7   of whom were male  and 42  60   white  Forty-five  65 3   patients had obstructive HCM  Hypertension and obesity  BMI >   30  were present in 45  64 3   and 37  52 9   patients  and the prevalence of atrial fibrillation  obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes was high  Common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever  cough  shortness of breath and fatigue  affecting 33  47 1    33  47 1    28  40 0    and 28  40 0   patients  respectively  Fourteen  20   patients were hospitalized  The majority  45  64 3   patients  recovered without intervention  Two patients had non-fatal pulmonary embolisms  1 had atrial fibrillation requiring electrical cardioversion and 1 had acute decompensated heart failure  Three  4 3   patients required mechanical ventilation  two of whom died  case fatality rate 2 9    A total of 15  21 4   patients were asymptomatic  Conclusions  Our data suggest that in this diverse and high-risk group of patients with HCM  established risk factors for severe COVID-19  such as obesity  may be more important drivers of morbidity and mortality than the presence of HCM alone,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34859067
9390,BACKGROUND  Nonthyroidal Illness Syndrome  NTIS  can be detected in many critical illnesses  Recently  we demonstrated that this condition is frequently observed in COVID-19 patients too and it is correlated with the severity the disease  However  the exact mechanism through which thyroid hormones influence the course of COVID-19  as well as that of many other critical illnesses  is not clear yet and treatment with T4  T3 or a combination of both is still controversial  Aim of this study was to analyze body composition in COVID-19 patients in search of possible correlation with the thyroid function  METHODS AND FINDINGS  We report here our experience performed in 74 critically ill COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit  ICU  of our University Hospital in Rome  In these patients  we evaluated the thyroid hormone function and body composition by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis  BIA  during the acute phase of the disease at admission in the ICU  To examine the effects of thyroid function on BIA parameters we analyzed also 96 outpatients  affected by thyroid diseases in different functional conditions  We demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with low FT3 serum values exhibited increased values of the Total Body Water Free Fat Mass  TBW FFM  ratio  Patients with the lowest FT3 serum values had also the highest level of TBW FFM ratio  This ratio is an indicator of the fraction of FFM as water and represents one of the best-known body-composition constants in mammals  We found an inverse correlation between FT3 serum values and this constant  Reduced FT3 serum values in COVID-19 patients were correlated with the increase in the total body water  TBW   the extracellular water  ECW  and the sodium potassium exchangeable ratio  Nae Ke   and with the reduction of the intracellular water  ICW   No specific correlation was observed in thyroid patients at different functional conditions between any BIA parameters and FT3 serum values  except for the patient with myxedema  that showed a picture similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients with NTIS  Since the Na    K    pump is a well-known T3 target  we measured the mRNA expression levels of the two genes coding for the two major isoforms of this pump  We demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with NTIS had lower levels of mRNA of both genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMC s obtained from our patients during the acute phase of the disease  In addition  we retrieved data from transcriptome analysis  performed on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes  hiPSC-CM s treated with T3 and we demonstrated that in these cells T3 is able to stimulate the expression of these two genes in a dose-dependent manner  CONCLUSIONS  In conclusion  we demonstrated that measurement of BIA parameters is a useful method to analyze water and salt retention in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in ICU and  in particular  in those that develop NTIS  Our results indicate that NTIS has peculiar similarities with myxedema seen in severe hypothyroid patients  albeit it occurs more rapidly  The Na    K    pump is a possible target of T3 action  involved in the pathogenesis of the anasarcatic condition observed in our COVID-19 patients with NTIS  Finally  measurement of BIA parameters may represent good endpoints to evaluate the benefit of future clinical interventional trials  based on the administration of T3 in patients with NTIS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34861865
8823,During the initial phase of pandemics  swift behavioral responses by individuals  such as social distancing  can temper the speed and magnitude of further infections  However  individual choices in this period are often made in the absence of reliable knowledge and coordinated policy interventions  producing variation in protective behaviors that cannot be easily deduced from that in later periods  Using unique monthly panel survey data  we examine variations in the association between changes in infections and risky behavior  particularly the frequencies of face-to-face conversations and dining out  between January to March 2020  We find that the increase in confirmed cases is negatively associated with the likelihood of these behaviors  However  high school graduates are less responsive than university graduates  We provide evidence that this can be attributed to their lower perception of infection risk  while we cannot fully rule out the roles of income opportunity costs  These results point to the benefits of interventions incorporating nudges to raise individuals  risk perceptions during the initial phase of pandemics  We also discuss the potential efficacy of such interventions in later periods of pandemics  Supplementary Information  The online version contains supplementary material available at 10 1007 s41885-021-00103-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34870077
6552,The COVID-19 pandemic presented enormous data challenges in the United States  Policy makers  epidemiological modelers  and health researchers all require up-to-date data on the pandemic and relevant public behavior  ideally at fine spatial and temporal resolution  The COVIDcast API is our attempt to fill this need  Operational since April 2020  it provides open access to both traditional public health surveillance signals  cases  deaths  and hospitalizations  and many auxiliary indicators of COVID-19 activity  such as signals extracted from deidentified medical claims data  massive online surveys  cell phone mobility data  and internet search trends  These are available at a fine geographic resolution  mostly at the county level  and are updated daily  The COVIDcast API also tracks all revisions to historical data  allowing modelers to account for the frequent revisions and backfill that are common for many public health data sources  All of the data are available in a common format through the API and accompanying R and Python software packages  This paper describes the data sources and signals  and provides examples demonstrating that the auxiliary signals in the COVIDcast API present information relevant to tracking COVID activity  augmenting traditional public health reporting and empowering research and decision-making,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34903654

8266,Infectious diseases  such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  pose a significant threat to public health globally  Fatality rate serves as a key indicator for the effectiveness of potential treatments or interventions  With limited time and understanding of novel emerging epidemics  comparisons of the fatality rates in real-time among different groups  say  divided by treatment  age  or area  have an important role to play in informing public health strategies  We propose a statistical test for the null hypothesis of equal real-time fatality rates across multiple groups during an ongoing epidemic  An elegant property of the proposed test statistic is that it converges to a Brownian motion under the null hypothesis  which allows one to develop a sequential testing approach for rejecting the null hypothesis at the earliest possible time when statistical evidence accumulates  This property is particularly important as scientists and clinicians are competing with time to identify possible treatments or effective interventions to combat the emerging epidemic  The method is widely applicable as it only requires the cumulative number of confirmed cases  deaths  and recoveries  A large-scale simulation study shows that the finite-sample performance of the proposed test is highly satisfactory  The proposed test is applied to compare the difference in disease severity among Wuhan  Hubei province  exclude Wuhan  and mainland China  exclude Hubei  from February to March 2020  The result suggests that the disease severity is potentially associated with the health care resource availability during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34878362

1672,Indian government announced the complete lockdown from 25 March  2020 for all outdoor activities across the country due to containment of COVID-19  This study is an attempt to assess the impacts of lockdown on ambient air quality in five cities of Indian National Capital Region including Delhi  Gurugram  Noida  Ghaziabad and Faridabad  In this context  the data of air pollutants  PM10  PM2 5  NOx  NO  NO2  SO2  NH3  SO2  CO  and C6H6  from 36 locations of the study area were analyzed from 1 st  March to 1 st  May  2020  The results showed that PM10 and PM2 5 level decreased upto 55-65    NOx and NO have shown maximum reduction   approximately 50-78     Similarly  consistent and significant reduction in other air pollutants such as SO2   approximately 33     CO   approximately 45     NH3   approximately 27    and C6H6   approximately 53    has been observed  During lockdown Air Quality Index  AQI  shows improvement as its value significantly decreased   approximately 45  -68     An interesting feature observed that during first week of lockdown O3 decreased but later it increased by approximately 19-27   The study suggests that this pandemic gives lessons for interventions for urban air pollution mitigation in controlling the health impact due to urban air pollution,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34977841
982,Rapid serology platforms are essential in disease pandemics for a variety of applications  including epidemiological surveillance  contact tracing  vaccination monitoring  and primary diagnosis in resource-limited areas  Laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  ELISA  platforms are inherently multistep processes that require trained personnel and are of relatively limited throughput  As an alternative  agglutination-based systems have been developed  however  they rely on donor red blood cells and are not yet available for high-throughput screening  Column agglutination tests are a mainstay of pretransfusion blood typing and can be performed at a range of scales  ranging from manual through to fully automated testing  Here  we describe a column agglutination test using colored microbeads coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that agglutinates when incubated with serum samples collected from patients recently infected with SARS-CoV-2  After confirming specific agglutination  we optimized centrifugal force and time to distinguish samples from uninfected vs SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and then showed concordant results against ELISA for 22 clinical samples  and also a set of serial bleeds from one donor at days 6-10 postinfection  Our study demonstrates the use of a simple  scalable  and rapid diagnostic platform that can be tailored to detect antibodies raised against SARS-CoV-2 and can be easily integrated with established laboratory frameworks worldwide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34990107
9576,The COVID-19 pandemic has presented considerable disruptions to routines that have challenged emotional well-being for children and their caregivers  One direction for supporting emotional well-being includes strategies that help children feel their best in the moment  which can bolster their capacity to respond appropriately to thoughts and behaviors  Strengthening emotional well-being equitably  however  must include opportunities in settings that are easily accessible to all  such as schools  In this paper  we focus on simple  evidence-informed strategies that can be used in schools to promote positive feelings in the moment and build coping behaviors that facilitate tolerance of uncertainty  We focus on those strategies that educators can easily and routinely use across ages  stages  and activities  Selected strategies are primarily tied to cognitive behavioral theory  with our review broadly organized across categories of self-awareness  self-soothing  and social relationships  We review evidence for each  providing examples that illustrate ease of use in school settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858296
3034,Introduction  Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  are at risk for superadded infections  especially infections caused by multidrug resistant  MDR  pathogens  Before the COVID-19 pandemic  the prevalence of MDR infections  including infections caused by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae  K  pneumoniae   was very high in Iran  This study is aimed at assessing the genetic diversity  antimicrobial resistance pattern  and biofilm formation in K  pneumoniae isolates obtained from patients with COVID-19 and ventilator-associated pneumonia  VAP  hospitalized in an intensive care unit  ICU  in Iran  Methods  In this cross-sectional study  seventy K  pneumoniae isolates were obtained from seventy patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the ICU of Shahid Beheshti hospital  Kashan  Iran  from May to September  2020  K  pneumoniae was detected through the ureD gene  Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method  and biofilm was detected using the microtiter plate assay method  Genetic diversity was also analyzed through polymerase chain reaction based on enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus  ERIC-PCR   The BioNumerics software  v  8 0  Applied Maths  Belgium  was used for analyzing the data and drawing dendrogram and minimum spanning tree  Findings  K  pneumoniae isolates had varying levels of resistance to antibiotics meropenem  80 4    cefepime-aztreonam-piperacillin tazobactam  70    tobramycin  61 4    ciprofloxacin  57 7    gentamicin  55 7    and imipenem  50    Around 77 14  of isolates were MDR  and 42 8  of them formed biofilm  Genetic diversity analysis revealed 28 genotypes  E1-E28  and 74 28  of isolates were grouped into ten clusters  i e   clusters A-J   Clusters were further categorized into three major clusters  i e   clusters E  H  and J  Antimicrobial resistance to meropenem  tobramycin  gentamicin  and ciprofloxacin in cluster J was significantly higher than cluster H  denoting significant relationship between ERIC clusters and antimicrobial resistance  However  there was no significant difference among major clusters E  H  and J respecting biofilm formation  Conclusion  K  pneumoniae isolates obtained from patients with COVID-19 have high antimicrobial resistance  and 44 2  of them have genetic similarity and can be clustered in three major clusters  There is a significant difference among clusters respecting antimicrobial resistance,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957300

2303,BACKGROUND  After an acute treatment for coronavirus disease  COVID-19   some symptoms may persist for several weeks  for example  fatigue  headaches  muscle and joint pain  cough  loss of taste and smell  sleep and memory disturbances  depression  Many viruses manipulate mitochondrial function  but the exact mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus effect remain unclear  We tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect mitochondrial energy production and endogenous biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10  CoQ10   METHODS  Ten patients after COVID-19 and 15 healthy individuals were included in the study  Platelets isolated from peripheral blood were used as an accessible source of mitochondria  High-resolution respirometry for the evaluation of platelets mitochondrial function  and HPLC method for CoQ10 determination were used  Oxidative stress was evaluated by TBARS concentration in plasma  RESULTS  Platelet mitochondrial respiratory chain function  oxidative phosphorylation and endogenous CoQ10 level were reduced in the patients after COVID-19  CONCLUSION  We assume that a reduced concentration of endogenous CoQ10 may partially block electron transfer in the respiratory chain resulting in a reduced adenosine triphosphate  ATP  production in the patients after COVID-19  Targeted mitochondrial therapy with CoQ10 supplementation and spa rehabilitation may improve mitochondrial health and accelerate the recovery of the patients after COVID-19  Platelet mitochondrial function and CoQ10 content may be useful mitochondrial health biomarkers after SARS-CoV-2 infection  Tab  3  Fig  3  Ref  46,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34967652
9754,Mental health disorders represent an enormous cost to society  are related to economic outcomes  and have increased markedly since the COVID-19 outbreak  Economic activity contracted dramatically on a global scale in 2020  representing the worst crisis since the Great Depression  This study used the COVID Impact Survey to provide insights on the interactions of mental illness and economic uncertainty during COVID-19  We used a probability-based panel survey  COVID Impact Survey  conducted in the U S  over three waves in the period April-June 2020  The survey covered individual information on employment  economic and financial uncertainty  mental and physical health  as well as other demographic information  The prevalence of moderate mental distress was measured using a Psychological Distress Scale  a 5-item scale that is scored on a 4-point scale  total range  0-15   The mental distress effect of employment  economic  and financial uncertainty  was assessed in a logit regression analysis conditioning for demographic and health information  It is found that employment  health coverage  social security  and food provision uncertainty are additional stressors for mental health  These economic factors work in addition to demographic effects  where groups who display increased risk for psychological distress include  women  Hispanics  and those in poor physical health  A decrease in employment and increases in economic uncertainty are associated with a doubling of common mental disorders  The population-representative survey evidence presented strongly suggests that economic policies which support employment  e g   job keeping  job search support  stimulus spending  provide not only economic security but also constitute a major health intervention  Moving forward  the economic uncertainty effect ought to be reflected in community level intervention and prevention efforts  which should include strengthening economic support to reduce financial and economic strain,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855850

9924,Several recent publications have described myopericarditis cases after the coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  vaccination  However  it is uncertain if these cases occurred secondary to the vaccination or more common etiologies of myopericarditis  To help determine whether a correlation exists between COVID-19 vaccination and myopericarditis  the present study compared the gender-specific cumulative incidence of myopericarditis and myocardial injury in a cohort of COVID-19 vaccinated patients at a tertiary care center in 2021 with the cumulative incidence of these conditions in the same subjects exactly 2 years earlier  We found that the age-adjusted incidence rate of myopericarditis in men was higher in the vaccinated than the control population  rate ratio 9 7  p   0 04   However  the age-adjusted incidence rate of myopericarditis in women was no different between the vaccinated and control populations  rate ratio 1 28  p   0 71   We further found that the rate of myocardial injury was higher in both men and women in 2021 than in 2019 both before and after vaccination  suggesting that some of the apparent increase in the diagnosis of myopericarditis after vaccination may be attributable to factors unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccinations  In conclusion  our study reaffirms the apparent increase in the diagnosis of myopericarditis after COVID-19 vaccination in men but not in women  although this finding may be confounded by increased rates of myocardial injury in 2021  The benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to individual and public health clearly outweigh the small potential increased risk of myopericarditis after vaccination,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34852929

1245,BACKGROUND  Autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility  AGID  is a limited form of dysautonomia that can be paraneoplastic or idiopathic  Some presentations can be preceded by a viral infection  METHODS  We report a case of a 17-year-old girl that developed intractable nausea and early satiety after SARS-CoV-2 infection  KEY RESULTS  Over ten months  she required nasogastric and nasoduodenal tube feedings and finally was advanced to total parenteral nutrition to meet her caloric needs  Her alpha3 nicotinic ganglionic acetylcholine and anti-striational antibodies were mildly elevated  Gastrointestinal transit scintigraphy studies showed delayed gastric emptying and slowed small bowel transit  Thermoregulatory sweat test showed areas of anhidrosis consistent with autonomic sudomotor impairment  After IVIG treatment the patient s symptoms improved dramatically and she was able to tolerate full oral diet  This was reflected by improvement of her baseline transit studies and the thermoregulatory sweat test  CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES  This is the first report of AGID occurring after SARS-CoV-2 infection  The dramatic response to IVIG emphasizes the importance of early recognition and the reversible and treatable nature of this condition,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34984765
5011,International travel and the infrastructures involved are key elements in controlling and predicting the number of infections by an infectious disease  specifically COVID-19 cases   This research presents the rates or percentages of compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures at several international airports in Europe  Madrid  Dublin  Paris-Charles de Gaulle  Zurich  Barcelona  and Bilbao   A structured survey called the COVID-19 Measures Implementation Rate at Airports  MIRA  was developed  First  the validity and reliability of the measurements obtained by MIRA were analyzed  A total of 1239 volunteers  passengers  cabin crew  and ground crew  participated in the study and answered the MIRA questionnaire  Second  once the validity and reliability of the measurements were assured  the rates or percentages of cases that observed compliance with the mitigation measures were calculated  The results indicated that participants perceived a low degree of compliance with sanitary measures in their international travel  the proportions ranged from 52 6  to 59    The airports with the highest compliance with mitigation measures were the Dublin  with a rate of 70   and Zurich airports  with a rate of 69 1    In conclusion  the percentages could be low due to the ineffective implementation of some of the mitigation measures  The low percentages are not related to the health measures themselves  The implications of mitigation measures for containing the transmission of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 are discussed,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34926139
5120,Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges which are being faced by mankind  Researchers are continuously trying to discover a vaccine or medicine for this highly infectious disease but  proper success is not achieved to date  Many countries are suffering from this disease and trying to find some solution that can prevent the dramatic spread of this virus  Although the mortality rate is not very high  the highly infectious nature of this virus makes it a global threat  RT-PCR test is the only means to confirm the presence of this virus to date  Only precautionary measures like early screening  frequent hand wash  social distancing use of masks  and other protective equipment can prevent us from this virus  Some researches show that the radiological images can be quite helpful for the early screening purpose because some features of the radiological images indicate the presence of the COVID-19 virus and therefore  it can serve as an effective screening tool  Automated analysis of these radiological images can help the physicians and other domain experts to study and screen the suspected patients easily and reliably within the stipulated amount of time  This method may not replace the traditional RT-PCR method for detection but  it can be helpful to filter the suspected patients from the rest of the community that can effectively reduce the spread in the of this virus  A novel method is proposed in this work to segment the radiological images for the better explication of the COVID-19 radiological images  The proposed method will be known as SuFMoFPA  Superpixel based Fuzzy Modified Flower Pollination Algorithm   The type 2 fuzzy clustering system is blended with this proposed approach to get the better-segmented outcome  Obtained results are quite promising and outperforming some of the standard approaches which are encouraging for the practical uses of the proposed approach to screening the COVID-19 patients,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34924697
351,Biosanitary experts around the world are directing their efforts towards the study of COVID-19  This effort generates a large volume of scientific publications at a speed that makes the effective acquisition of new knowledge difficult  Therefore  Information Systems are needed to assist biosanitary experts in accessing  consulting and analyzing these publications  In this work we develop a study of the variables involved in the development of a Question Answering system that receives a set of questions asked by experts about the disease COVID-19 and its causal virus SARS-CoV-2  and provides a ranked list of expert-level answers to each question  In particular  we address the interrelation of the Information Retrieval and the Answer Extraction steps  We found that a recall based document retrieval that leaves to a neural answer extraction module the scanning of the whole documents to find the best answer is a better strategy than relying in a precise passage retrieval before extracting the answer span,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002094

4938,The recent pandemic has considerably changed urban transportation while highlighting the weaknesses of the current transport modes  The crisis provided a unique opportunity to redesign the urban mobility plans in a more sustainable and resilient way  This study captured the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent restrictive measures on citizens  commuting habits and travel mode choice in two Cretan cities with academic communities and intense seasonality of tourism  in two phases  four periods  before  during  and after the quarantine  The sample consisted of 308  1st phase  and 193  2nd phase  citizens  60  and 30  permanent residents of Chania and Rethymno  respectively  During the weeks before the pandemic  4 10 participants opted for travelling by car daily  either as a driver or as a passenger  almost the same ratio chose walking  1 10 used public transport  bus   During the first week of the quarantine  one-quarter had decreased car usage and opted for sustainable transport modes  walking  cycling  public transport   The population who chose walking 1-2 times weekly almost doubled  Nevertheless  most factors were found to affect men and women differently  personal safety and road safety are significantly more important for women  ecological footprint is a less essential parameter for men s travel mode choice  Private vehicle use still holds a considerable role in urban transportation  and noteworthy is due to the sharp decline in public transit in January-February and April and the meager percentage of public transport ridership  1    The analysis and modelling could be useful in the future design of more sustainable and resilient mobility strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927039
7078,COVID-19 has brought speculations on potential transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2   the causal agent of the pandemic  It is reported that the main route of virus transmission to be person-to-person by respiratory droplets  however  people have raised concerns on the possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans via food and packaging and its potential effects on food safety  This review discusses food safety issues in the COVID-19 pandemic and reveals its possible transmission in cold-chain food  The first outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan  China  while the second outbreak of COVID-19 in June 2020 was also related to a seafood market in Beijing  China  As of 2020  several frozen seafood products linked with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China  According to the current survey and scientific studies  the risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2 from cold-chain food  food products  and food packaging is thought to be very low  However  studies on food cold chain contamination have shown that SARS-CoV-2 remained highly stable under refrigerated  4 degrees C  and even in freezing conditions  -10 to -80 degrees C   Since one mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission appears to be touching contaminated surfaces  it is important to clean and sanitize food contact surfaces properly  Understanding food safety hazard risks is essential to avoid potential negative health effects and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the food supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898751
8587,During the COVID-19 pandemic lasting now for well more than a year  nearly 247 million cases have been diagnosed and over 5 million deaths have been recorded worldwide as of November 2021  The devastating effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the immune system lead to the activation of signaling pathways involved in inflammation and the production of inflammatory cytokines  SARS-CoV-2 displays a great deal of homology with other coronaviruses  especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which all display similar components which may serve as targets  namely the Spike  S  protein  the main protease  M Pro   which is a chymotrypsin-like protease  CL Pro   and RNA-directed RNA polymerase  RdRp   Natural constituents found in traditional herbal medicines  dietary supplements and foods demonstrate activity against SARS-CoV-2 by affecting the production of cytokines  modulating cell signaling pathways related to inflammation and even by direct interaction with targets found in the virus  This has been demonstrated by the application of fluorescence resonance energy transfer  FRET  experiments  assays of cytopathic effect  CPE  and in silico molecular docking studies that estimate binding strength  Glycyrrhizin  flavonoids such as quercetin  kaempferol and baicalein  and other polyphenols are the most common constituents found in Traditional Chinese Medicines that modulate inflammation and cell signaling pathways  and bind viral targets demonstrating valuable effects against SARS-CoV-2  However  the bioavailability of these natural products and their dependence on each other in extracts make it difficult to assess their actual utility in the treatment of COVID-19  Therefore  more can be learned through rational drug design based on natural products and from well-designed clinical trials employing specific doses of standardized combinations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34873386
5471,PURPOSE  To assess maternal mental health during the first weeks after birth including birth experience  postpartum adjustment to early motherhood and the perception of newborn behaviour  and how this may be influenced by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS  Ninety women who gave birth after the first enforcement of nation-wide disease control restrictions in Germany between 16 March and 10 May 2020 were surveyed and compared with 101 women who had given birth before the pandemic  Information on maternal mental health and maternal perception of early motherhood and neonatal behaviour were assessed at 3-8 weeks postpartum  RESULTS  Mothers who gave birth under the COVID-19-associated disease control restrictions did not show significant differences in depression  anxiety and social support scales compared to mothers before the pandemic  Birth experience was similar  while support during birth was perceived to be higher under the COVID-19 restrictions  Confidence in caretaking of the newborn and perception of neonatal behaviour were comparable between the two groups  Mothers expressed significantly higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role during the pandemic  CONCLUSIONS  Overall  maternal mental health and the perception of the newborn and early caretaking during the first COVID-19 wave did not substantially differ from the perceptions of mothers before the pandemic  A potential influence of the pandemic on higher dissatisfaction with the maternal role may be associated with the pandemic conditions affecting everyday life and should be addressed in postpartum care and in future qualitative and longitudinal studies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34918988
3298,The rapid accumulation of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant that enabled its outbreak raises questions as to whether its proximal origin occurred in humans or another mammalian host  Here  we identified 45 point mutations that Omicron acquired since divergence from the B 1 1 lineage  We found that the Omicron spike protein sequence was subjected to stronger positive selection than that of any reported SARS-CoV-2 variants known to evolve persistently in human hosts  suggesting a possibility of host-jumping  The molecular spectrum of mutations  i e   the relative frequency of the 12 types of base substitutions  acquired by the progenitor of Omicron was significantly different from the spectrum for viruses that evolved in human patients  but resembled the spectra associated with virus evolution in a mouse cellular environment  Furthermore  mutations in the Omicron spike protein significantly overlapped with SARS-CoV-2 mutations known to promote adaptation to mouse hosts  particularly through enhanced spike protein binding affinity for the mouse cell entry receptor  Collectively  our results suggest that the progenitor of Omicron jumped from humans to mice  rapidly accumulated mutations conducive to infecting that host  then jumped back into humans  indicating an inter-species evolutionary trajectory for the Omicron outbreak,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954396
9768,PURPOSE OF REVIEW  The COVID-19 pandemic has tested people s coping and resilience  This article reviews research and scholarly work aiming to shed more light on personality-based factors that account for adjustment to the pandemic situation  RECENT FINDINGS  Most studies relied on a cross-sectional design and were conducted using personality dimensions based on the Big Five personality model  Findings suggest that high levels of neuroticism constitute a risk for pandemic-induced distress and poor overall coping  People with prominent extraversion  conscientiousness or agreeableness have generally demonstrated a good adjustment to the pandemic  including compliance with containment and mitigation measures imposed by the authorities to limit the spread of COVID-19  A few studies of individuals with borderline personality disorder identified social isolation as the most destabilising factor for them  Poor compliance with containment and mitigation measures has been strongly associated with various antisocial personality traits  SUMMARY  Personality-based factors account for some individual differences in coping with both COVID-19-related threat and distress and requirements to comply with containment and mitigation measures  Better understanding of these factors could contribute to a more effective adjustment to the challenges of future public health crises,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855697
5261,BACKGROUND  The pandemic has challenged educational institutions to catalyze digitalization and rapidly develop online teaching formats  The aim of the study was to evaluate the teaching offered for oral and maxillofacial surgery at our university during the pandemic and to investigate the students  perceptions of the current situation  METHODS  A 38-item questionnaire with five sections  demographic information  lectures  internships  e-learning  and pandemic-related solutions effects  was created online  Most questions were answered on a 10-point Likert scale  with 1 indicating  fully agree positive  and 10 indicating  totally disagree negative   The remaining questions were either answered with yes no  percent value  or open-ended text responses  All 3rd-5th year dental students were invited to voluntarily participate and were sent a link by email in a general mail shot  RESULTS  A total of 63 7  of the participants had no prior experience with online courses before the pandemic  The students stated that the change from face-to-face to online teaching worked very well in the last two semesters  mean   2 73  standard deviation   2 05   Overall  the pandemic had a rather positive influence on the acquisition of theoretical skills and a negative influence on the acquisition of practical skills  p < 0 0001   The evaluation showed that  compared to other dental clinics at our university  the department for oral and maxillofacial surgery was well prepared for the pandemic  CONCLUSION  Digitalization of oral and maxillofacial surgery teaching in dental education is possible but depends on the institution s preparatory work and technological possibilities  The students declared a high acceptance of digital learning formats and indicated an increased motivation to learn due to e-learning  The pandemic s influence on the students  education was rated ambivalent,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34922586

8382,This article assesses the extent to which children s language preference and their home environment matter for literacy retention  Using data from the Complementary Basic Education  CBE  program in Ghana  the authors found that large numbers of disadvantaged students reverted to not even being able to read a single word following school closures over a four-month holiday period  Widening literacy gaps were found for girls who reported they did not receive instruction in a language that they understood or did not have the resources  support  or activities at home to enable them to continue to learn while schools were closed  For boys  widening literacy gaps were only influenced by resources  support  or activities at home  but not by language preferences  The article findings suggest that schools and teachers must pay closer attention to language preference  particularly for girls  in order to ensure that language of instruction is not a barrier to literacy retention  The article also provides further evidence to support the growing claims that home supports are essential for reducing inequities in learning outcomes during school closures,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34876757
2248,The aim of this study was to explore the postpartum experiences of new parents during the COVID-19 pandemic  The postpartum period can be a time of significant transition  both positive and negative  for parents as they navigate new relationships with their babies and shifts in family dynamics  Physical distancing requirements mandated by public health orders during the COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to create even more stress for parents with a newborn  Examining personal experiences would provide health care professionals with information to help guide support during significant isolation  Feminist poststructuralism guided the qualitative research process  Sixty-eight new mothers completed an open-ended on-line survey  Responses were analyzed using discourse analysis to examine the beliefs  values  and practices of the participants relating to their family experiences during the pandemic period  It was found that pandemic isolation was a time of complexity with both  blessings and curses   Participants reported that it was a time for family bonding and enjoyment of being a new parent without the usual expectations  It was also a time of missed opportunities as they were not able to share milestones and memories with extended family  Caring for a newborn during the COVID-19 pandemic where complex contradictions were constructed by competing social discourses created difficult dichotomies for families  In acknowledging the complex experiences of mothers during COVID-19 isolation  nurses and midwives can come to understand and help new parents to focus on the blessings of this time while acknowledging the curses,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968364

2943,Decades of concerns about the quality of care provided by nursing homes have led state and federal agencies to create layers of regulations and penalties  As such  regulatory efforts to improve nursing home care have largely focused on the identification of deficiencies and assignment of sanctions  The current regulatory strategy often places nursing home teams and government agencies at odds  hindering their ability to build a culture of safety in nursing homes that is foundational to health care quality  Imbuing safety culture into nursing homes will require nursing homes and regulatory agencies to acknowledge the high-risk nature of post-acute and long-term care settings  embrace just culture  and engage nursing home staff and stakeholders in actions that are supported by evidence-based best practices  The response to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some of these actions  leading to changes in nursing survey and certification processes as well as deployment of strike teams to support nursing homes in crisis  These actions  coupled with investments in public health that include funds earmarked for nursing homes  could become the initial phases of an intentional renovation of the existing regulatory oversight from one that is largely punitive to one that is rooted in safety culture and proactively designed to achieve meaningful and sustained improvements in the quality of care and life for nursing home residents,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34958744

9565,SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection induces heterogeneous symptoms  ranging from asymptomatic to lethal forms  Severe forms usually occur in the elderly and or individuals with comorbidities  Children generally remain asymptomatic to primary infection  suggesting that they may have an effective local innate immune response  IFN-I and -III have non-redundant protective roles against SARS-CoV-2  although sometimes damaging the host  The expression and role of anti-viral peptides during SARS-CoV-2 infection have thus far been little studied  We aimed to identify the innate immune molecules present at the SARS-CoV-2 entry point  We analyzed the mRNA levels of type I  IFN-alpha and -beta  and type III  IFN-lambda1-3  interferons and selected antiviral peptides  i e   beta-defensins 1-3  alpha-defensins  HNP1-3  HD5  pentraxin-3  surfactant protein D  the cathelicidin LL-37 and interleukin-26  in nasopharyngeal swabs from 226 individuals of various ages  either infected with SARS-CoV-2  symptomatic or asymptomatic  or negative for the virus  We observed that infection induced selective upregulation of IFN-lambda1 expression in pediatric subjects  <  15 years   whereas IFN-alpha  IFN-beta  IFN-lambda2 lambda3  and beta-defensin 1-3 expression was unaffected  Conversely  infection triggered upregulation of IFN-alpha  IFN-beta  IFN-lambda2 lambda3  and beta-defensin 1-3 mRNA expression in adults  15-65 years  and the elderly  >   65 years   but without modulation of IFN-lambda1  The expression of these innate molecules was not associated with gender or symptoms  Expression of the interferon-stimulated genes IFITM1 and IFITM3 was upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects and reached similar levels in the three age groups  Finally  age-related differences in nasopharyngeal innate immunity were also observed in SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects  This study shows that the expression patterns of IFN-I -III and certain anti-viral molecules in the nasopharyngeal mucosa of SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects differ with age and suggests that susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 may be related to intrinsic differences in the nature of mucosal anti-viral innate immunity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34858406

9355,BACKGROUND  Invasive bacterial infection  IBI  remains a major burden of mortality and morbidity in children  As coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  emerged  stringent nonpharmaceutical interventions  NPIs  were applied worldwide  This study aimed to evaluate the impact of NPIs on pediatric IBI in Korea  METHODS  From January 2018 to December 2020  surveillance for pediatric IBIs caused by 9 pathogens  S  pneumoniae  H  influenzae  N  meningitidis  S  agalactiae  S  pyogenes  S  aureus  Salmonella species  L  monocytogenes and E  coli  was performed at 22 hospitals throughout Korea  Annual incidence rates were compared before and after the COVID-19 pandemic  RESULTS  A total of 651 cases were identified and the annual incidence was 194 0 cases per 100 000 in-patients in 2018  170 0 in 2019 and 172 4 in 2020  Most common pathogen by age group was S  agalactiae in infants < 3 months  n   129  46 7    S  aureus in 3 to < 24 months  n   35  37 2    Salmonella spp  in 24 to < 60 months  n   24  34 8   and S  aureus in children >   5 years  n   128  60 7    Compared with 2018 to 2019  the incidence rate in 2020 decreased by 57  for invasive pneumococcal disease  26 6 vs  11 5 per 100 000 in-patients  P   0 014  and 59  for Salmonella spp  infection  22 8 vs  9 4 per 100 000 in-patients  P   0 018   In contrast  no significant changes were observed in invasive infections due to S  aureus  S  agalactiae and E  coli  CONCLUSIONS  The NPIs implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced invasive diseases caused by S  pneumoniae and Salmonella spp  but not S  aureus  S  agalactiae and E  coli in children,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34862341
7620,It is now widely accepted that the standard inferential toolkit used by the scientific research community-null-hypothesis significance testing  NHST -is not fit for purpose  Yet despite the threat posed to the scientific enterprise  there is no agreement concerning alternative approaches for evidence assessment  This lack of consensus reflects long-standing issues concerning Bayesian methods  the principal alternative to NHST  We report on recent work that builds on an approach to inference put forward over 70 years ago to address the well-known  Problem of Priors  in Bayesian analysis  by reversing the conventional prior-likelihood-posterior   forward   use of Bayes  theorem  Such Reverse-Bayes analysis allows priors to be deduced from the likelihood by requiring that the posterior achieve a specified level of credibility  We summarise the technical underpinning of this approach  and show how it opens up new approaches to common inferential challenges  such as assessing the credibility of scientific findings  setting them in appropriate context  estimating the probability of successful replications  and extracting more insight from NHST while reducing the risk of misinterpretation  We argue that Reverse-Bayes methods have a key role to play in making Bayesian methods more accessible and attractive for evidence assessment and research synthesis  As a running example we consider a recently published meta-analysis from several randomised controlled trials  RCTs  investigating the association between corticosteroids and mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889058

1033,PURPOSE  This study aims to provide new knowledge on the relative importance of key life domains amongst older adults  and how the Coronavirus pandemic has influenced their life  domain  satisfaction  METHODS  A cross-sectional survey was administrated to an online panel of the general public aged 65 years and older in Australia from 28 April to 26 May 2020  Life satisfaction was measured by the Personal Wellbeing Index  PWI  including both global life satisfaction and life domain satisfaction   A discrete choice experiment technique was used to elicit how respondents perceive the relative importance of six key life domains drawn from the PWI  standard of living  health  relationships  safety  community connectedness  and future security  RESULTS  A total of 1 056 respondents  53  female  with a mean  range  age of 73  65-91  years old completed the survey  After controlling for a rich set of confounding factors  regardless of the choice of overall life satisfaction indicators  there were consistent findings that the strongest negative influence of COVID-19 on life domains and decrements on life satisfaction was for Personal Health  Personal Relationships and Standard of Living  The DCE data revealed that all six life domains were statistically significant in contributing to a better life  and there exists some preference heterogeneity between those who perceived no impact versus negative impacts from COVID-19  CONCLUSIONS  From both revealed and stated preference data there was robust evidence that health  relationships  and standard of living represent the three most important life domains for older adults in Australia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34988850
6653,Given the urgent need to control the spread of the novel COVID-19 virus  thirteen vaccines have been approved for emergency use before completing all three phases of the clinical trials  Thereby a careful monitor of the adverse effects postvaccination is essential  We searched through PubMed and other reporting systems like VAERS for the reported cardiovascular adverse events post-COVID-19 vaccination  Through our review  we determined that the incidence of all the reported cardiovascular events is very rare  Additionally  the vaccine was initially given to the elderly and high-risk populations in which cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias are already more prevalent  while other cardiovascular events such as myocarditis or vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia were more common in younger populations  Moreover  a direct causal relationship  if any  between vaccination and adverse events is yet to be fully elucidated  Thus  at this time point  the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risk,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34902392
7699,Background  Blood groups are inherited traits that affect the susceptibility severity of a disease  A clear relationship between coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  and ABO blood groups is yet to be established in the Indian population  This study aimed to demonstrate an association of the distribution and severity of COVID-19 with ABO blood groups  Methods  A cross-sectional study was conducted after obtaining ethics approval  IEC 207 20  among hospitalized patients using in-patient records and analyzed on SPSS-25  Chi-square tests were used for the analysis of categorical data and independent sample t-test Mann-Whitney U tests were used for continuous data  Results  The B blood group had the highest prevalence among COVID-19-positive patients  The AB blood group was significantly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS   p   0 03   sepsis  p   0 02   and septic shock  p   0 02   The O blood group was associated with significantly lower rates of lymphopenia and leucocytosis  However  no significant clinical association was seen in the O blood group  Conclusion  This study has demonstrated that blood groups have a similar distribution among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the South Indian population  Additionally  it preludes to a possible association between the AB blood group and ARDS  sepsis  and septic shock  Further studies having a larger representation of AB blood groups  especially in patients hospitalized for critical COVID-19  with adjustment for possible covariates  are warranted to provide a reliable estimate of the risk in the South Indian population,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888199
5303,The WHO-named Coronavirus Disease 2019  COVID-19  infection had become a pandemic within a short time period since it was detected in Wuhan  The outbreak required the screening of millions of samples daily and overwhelmed diagnostic laboratories worldwide  During this pandemic  the handling of patient specimens according to the universal guidelines was extremely difficult as the WHO  CDC and ECDC required cold chain compliance during transport and storage of the swab samples  The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two different storage conditions on the COVID-19 real-time PCR assay on 30 positive nasopharyngeal and or oropharyngeal samples stored at both ambient temperature  22   - 2 degrees C  and  4 degrees C  The results revealed that all the samples stored at ambient temperature remain PCR positive for at least six days without any false-negative result  In conclusion  transporting and storing these types of swab samples at ambient temperature for six days under resource-limited conditions during the COVID-19 pandemics are acceptable,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921841

8328,Background  Early recognition of high-risk patients with coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  may improve outcomes  Although many predictive scoring systems exist  their complexity may limit utility in COVID-19  We assessed the prognostic performance of the National Early Warning Score  NEWS  and an age-based modification  NEWS age  among hospitalized COVID-19 patients enrolled in a prospective  multicenter US Military Health System  MHS  observational cohort study  Methods  Hospitalized adults with confirmed COVID-19 not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation at admission and with a baseline NEWS were included  We analyzed each scoring system s ability to predict key clinical outcomes  including progression to invasive ventilation or death  stratified by baseline severity  low  0-3   medium  4-6   and high  >  7    Results  Among 184 included participants  those with low baseline NEWS had significantly shorter hospitalizations  P <  01  and lower maximum illness severity  P <  001   Most  80 2   of low NEWS vs 15 8  of high NEWS participants required no or at most low-flow oxygen supplementation  Low NEWS  <  3  had a negative predictive value of 97 2  for progression to invasive ventilation or death  a high NEWS  >  7  had high specificity  93 1   but low positive predictive value  42 1   for such progression  NEWS age performed similarly to NEWS at predicting invasive ventilation or death  NEWS age  area under the receiver operating characteristics curve  AUROC   0 69  95  CI  0 65-0 73  NEWS  AUROC  0 70  95  CI  0 66-0 75   Conclusions  NEWS and NEWS age showed similar test characteristics in an MHS COVID-19 cohort  Notably  low baseline scores had an excellent negative predictive value  Given their easy applicability  these scoring systems may be useful in resource-limited settings to identify COVID-19 patients who are unlikely to progress to critical illness,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34877361
6080,Natural products recognized traditionally as a vital source of active constituents in pharmacotherapy  The COVID-19 infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  is highly transmissible  pathogenic  and considered an ongoing global health emergency  The emergence of COVID-19 globally and the lack of adequate treatment brought attention towards herbal medicines  and scientists across the globe instigated the search for novel drugs from medicinal plants and natural products to tackle this deadly virus  The natural products rich in scaffold diversity and structural complexity are an excellent source for antiviral drug discovery  Recently the investigation of several natural products and their synthetic derivatives resulted in the identification of promising anti SARS-CoV-2 agents  This review article will highlight the pharmacological relevance and chemical synthesis of the recently discovered natural product and their synthetic analogs as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors  The summarized information will pave the path for the natural product-based drug discovery of safe and potent antiviral agents  particularly against SARS-CoV-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34909460
4907,We examined whether  the lack of  social support can explain why researchers have found lower rates of adherence to follow public health guidelines amongst people who perceived themselves as coming from lower social class backgrounds during the COVID-19 pandemic  To do this  we surveyed 5818 participants from 10 countries during the first wave of lock-down  Contrary to previous findings  social class was not related to general adherence to COVID-19 regulations or desire to engage in citizenship behaviours  e g   showing initiatives to help others during the pandemic   However  we found evidence of an indirect effect whereby those who perceived themselves as higher social class were more likely to be both the recipient and provider of social support which in turn predicted greater adherence and desire to engage in citizenship behaviours during the earlier wave of the pandemic  Our findings highlight the importance of social support in unlocking potential for collective cooperation  i e   adherence to COVID-19 rules and desire to engage in citizenship behaviours   They suggest that instead of enforcing strict regulations  government authorities need to address existing social support barriers within lower income communities to facilitate cooperation from everyone in the community,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34927256
8101,BACKGROUND  Assessment of muscle quantity by sonographic muscle indices could help identify patients at risk for fatal outcome during coronavirus disease-2019  COVID-19   The aim of this study was to explore sonographic muscle indices as predictors of COVID-19 outcome and to test the feasibility of sonographic muscle measurement in an isolation context  METHODS  Muscle indices  derived from the psoas muscle or thigh muscles  were quantified by sonography in a cohort of patients without COVID-19 to obtain reference values for low muscle quantity  Gender-specific median of different muscle indices were defined as threshold value for low muscle quantity  The prognostic relevance of low muscle quantity  was prospectively explored in two cohorts of hospitalized COVID-19 patients  Optimal muscle index cutoff values predictive for 30 day mortality during COVID-19 were determined by receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve and Youden index calculation  Muscle quantity and known prognostic factors of COVID-19 were analysed by multivariable log-regression  RESULTS  Compared with other muscle indices  the psoas muscle area index  PMAI  showed the most favourable characteristics to predict outcome of COVID-19 disease  Sonographic morphometry of patients without COVID-19  n   136  revealed a gender-specific median for PMAI  male  291 1 mm 2   m 2    female 260 6 mm 2   m 2    as threshold value of low muscle quantity  Subsequently  COVID-19 patients  Cohort I  n   58  Cohort II  n   55  were prospectively assessed by bedside sonography  The studied COVID-19 patients developed a critical course of disease in 22 4   Cohort I  n   13 58  and 34 5   Cohort II  n   20 55   Mortality rate reached 12 1   Cohort I  n   7 58  and 20 0   Cohort I  n   11 55  within 30 days of follow up  COVID-19 patients with a PMAI below the gender-specific median showed a higher 30 day mortality in both COVID-19 cohorts  log rank  P < 0 05   The optimal PMAI cutoff value  206 mm 2   m 2    predicted 30 day mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a sensitivity of 72  and specificity of 78 5   receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve  0 793  95  confidence interval 0 671-0 914  P   0 008   Multivariable log-regression analysis of PMAI  age  gender  BMI and comorbidities confirmed an independent association of low PMAI with 30 day mortality of COVID-19 patients  P   0 018   CONCLUSIONS  Sonographic morphometry provides reliable muscle quantification under hygienic precautions and allows risk stratification of patients with COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34881516
4740,BACKGROUND  During the COVID-19 pandemic  CF centers shifted to a telehealth delivery model  Our study aimed to determine how people with CF  PwCF  and their families experienced telehealth and assessed its quality and acceptability for future CF care  METHODS  The CF Patient and Family State of Care Survey  PFSoC  was fielded from August 31-October 30  2020  The PFSoC explored themes of overall telehealth quality  ease of use  desirability  and preference for a future mix of in-person and telehealth care  Demographic covariates considered included  gender  age  CFTR modulator status  and region of residence  RESULTS  424 PwCF and parents of PwCF responded  47  parents   Most  81   reported a telehealth visit which included a MD APP and nurse team members  91  found telehealth easy to use  and 66  reported similar higher quality than in-person care  One-third  34   reported the highest desire for future telehealth care  with 45   n  212  desiring 50  or more of visits conducted via telehealth  Adults were more likely than parents to report highest desire for future telehealth  64  vs  36    Respondents who perceived telehealth as similar higher quality were more likely to desire future telehealth compared to those who perceived telehealth as lower quality  96  vs  50    Mixed methods analysis revealed themes affecting perceptions of telehealth  CONCLUSIONS  PwCF desire for future telehealth was influenced by perception of quality and age  Several themes emerged that need to be explored as telehealth is adapted into the CF chronic care model  especially when thinking about integration into pediatric care,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34930542

7565,BACKGROUND  The COVID-19 pandemic has stricken mental health worldwide  Marginalized populations in low- and middle-income countries have been the most affected  as they were already experiencing barriers to accessing mental health care prior to the pandemic and are unequally exposed to the stressors associated with the health emergency  such as economic ravages or increased risk of complicated disease outcomes  OBJECTIVE  The aim of this paper is to describe a comprehensive initiative resulting from a public-civil partnership to address the increased burden of mental health illness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Chiapas  Mexico  METHODS  To address the emerging health needs of the general population and health professionals resulting from the pandemic  Companeros En Salud  CES   a non-profit civil society organization based in Chiapas  implemented a comprehensive strategy to compensate for the shortage of mental health services in the region in collaboration with the Chiapas Ministry of Health  The strategy included three components  capacity building in mental health care delivery  psychosocial support to the general population  and provision of mental health care to CES collaborating staff  In this capacity building article  implementers from CES and the government share descriptive information on the specific interventions carried out and their beneficiaries  as well as a critical discussion of the strategy followed  RESULTS  Through this strategy  we have been successful in filling the gaps in the public health system to ensure that CES-served populations and CES-collaborating health professionals have access to mental health care  However  further studies to quantify the impact of this intervention in alleviating the burden of mental health illnesses associated with the pandemic are needed  CONCLUSIONS  The current situation represents an opportunity to reimagine global mental health  Only through the promotion of community-based initiatives and the development of integrated approaches will we ensure the well-being of marginalized populations,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34889715
4601,BACKGROUND  The digital era has ushered in an unprecedented volume of readily accessible information  including news coverage of current events  Research has shown that the sentiment of news articles can evoke emotional responses from readers on a daily basis with specific evidence for increased anxiety and depression in response to coverage of the recent coronavirus  COVID-19  pandemic  Given the primacy and relevance of such information exposure  its daily impact on the mental health of the general population within this modality warrants further nuanced investigation  OBJECTIVE  Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a subject-specific example  this work aimed to profile and examine associations between the dynamics of semantic affect in online local news headlines and same-day online mental health term search behavior over time across the United States  METHODS  Using COVID-related news headlines from a database of online news stories in conjunction with mental health-related online search data from Google Trends  this paper first explored the statistical and qualitative affective properties of state-specific COVID news coverage across the United States from January 23  2020 to October 22  2020  The resultant operationalizations and findings from the joint application of dictionary-based sentiment analysis and the circumplex theory of affect informed the construction of subsequent hypothesis-driven mixed-effects models  Daily state-specific counts of mental health search queries were regressed on circumplex-derived features of semantic affect  time  and state  as a random effect  to model the associations between the dynamics of news affect and search behavior throughout the pandemic  Search terms were also grouped into depression symptoms  anxiety symptoms  and non-specific depression and anxiety symptoms to model the broad impact of news coverage on mental health  RESULTS  Exploratory efforts revealed patterns in day-to-day news headline affect variation across the first nine months of the pandemic  In addition  circumplex mapping of the most frequently used words in state-specific headlines uncovered time-agnostic similarities and differences across the United States  including the ubiquitous use of negatively valenced and strongly arousing language  Subsequent mixed-effects modeling implicated increased consistency in affective tone  SpinVA beta -0 207  p< 001  as predictive of increased depression-related search term activity  with emotional language patterns indicative of affective uncontrollability  FluxA beta 0 221  p< 001  contributing generally to an increase in online mental health search term frequency  CONCLUSIONS  The present study demonstrated promise in applying the circumplex model of affect to written content and provided a practical example for how circumplex theory can be integrated with sentiment analysis techniques to interrogate mental health-related associations  The findings from pandemic-specific news headlines highlighted arousal  flux  and spin as potentially significant affect-based foci for further study  Future efforts may also benefit from more expansive sentiment analysis approaches to more broadly test the practical application and theoretical capabilities of the circumplex model of affect on text-based data  CLINICALTRIAL,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34932494
328,Violent respiratory diseases  i e   coronavirus  COVID-19   spread through saliva in coughs and sneezes or are even exhaled in the form of microbial pathogen micro-droplets  Therefore  in this work  a comprehensive fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method has been applied for infection control  thus leading to a deeper understanding of the saliva-disease-carrier droplet transmission mechanisms and also of their trajectory tracking by using the OpenFOAM package  This model determines the droplet-air interactions  the breakup process  and turbulent dispersion forces on each micro-droplet that is expelled within the respiratory tract in a correct way  By examining a broad range of initial velocities  size distributions  injection angles of saliva micro-droplets  and mouth opening areas  we predict the maximum opening area that can be driven by micro-droplets  One important contribution of this work is to present a correlation for the length and width of the overall direct maximum reach of the micro-droplets  driven by a wide range of mild coughs to intense sneezes  Our results indicate that the movement of the expelled droplets is mainly influenced by their size  angle  velocity  and environmental factors  During a virus crisis  like COVID-19  this paper can be used to determine the  social distance  between individuals to avoid contamination  by inhaling or touching their bodies  due to these saliva-disease-carrier droplets in sneezing  at various social distance positions such as face-to-face  meeting standing  and near equipment  The safe distance must be increased to around 4 m during a sneeze  By wearing a face mask and by bending the head during a sneeze as a protective action  we can reduce the contamination area to one-third and three-quarters  respectively  Furthermore  the dispersion of the film of the expelled saliva micro-droplets and the spatial relationship between the subjects  which affects the airflow inside the room  are also analyzed in detail,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002198

5753,The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-2021 has highlighted the importance of vaccines and vaccination in human health  The pandemic has resulted in social distancing  travel restrictions  decreased trade  high unemployment  commodity price decline  and financial stress that has impacted the global economy  Since December 2020  a massive vaccination campaign is undergoing in every country on the planet to protect against SARS-CoV-2  Vaccination is the cheapest health-care interventions that can save more lives than any other drugs or therapies  Some of the common diseases of the twentieth century including smallpox and polio are seldom reported due to intense vaccination programs that eradicated it  Smallpox is completely eradicated globally  whereas  polio is confined to only a couple of countries  Vaccination has not only improved the health of man but also improved food security by preventing diseases in farm animals and aquacultured fish  Awareness of the principles of immunology and novel vaccines has led to effective vaccination strategies  Climate change could lead to generation of new strains of infectious microorganisms that would require development of novel vaccines  Recent years have seen the increase in incidence of brain-eating amoeba and flesh-eating bacteria  necrotizing fasciitis   There are no vaccines for these diseases  Though vaccination programs have eradicated several diseases and increased the quality of life  there are several diseases that have no effective vaccines  Currently there are no vaccines for cancer  neurodegenerative diseases  autoimmune diseases  as well as infectious diseases like tuberculosis  AIDS  and parasitic diseases including malaria  Spontaneous evolution of pathogenic microorganisms may lead to pandemics that impact the health of not only humanity but also other animals  Hence  the challenge to vaccinologists is the development of novel vaccines and vaccination strategies within limited time period and using minimum resources  In addition  the vaccine developed should be administered globally within a short duration so as to prevent generation of pathogenic variants more lethal than the parent strain,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34914040
713,UNSTRUCTURED  In the Czech Republic  the strategic data-based and organisational support for individual regions and for providers of acute care on the nationwide level is coordinated by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic  At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  the country needed to implement very quickly a system for monitoring  reporting and overall management of hospital capacities  This viewpoint paper aims to describe the purpose and basic functions of a web-based application entitled  Control Centre for Intensive Care   which has been developed and made available for the needs of systematic online technical support for the management of intensive inpatient care across the Czech Republic during the first wave of pandemic in spring 2020  Two tools of key importance are described in the context of national methodology  namely one module for regular online updates and overall monitoring of currently free capacities of intensive care in real time  and a second module for online entering and overall record keeping of requirements on medications for COVID-19 patients  A total of 134 intensive care providers and 927 users from hospitals from all 14 regions of the Czech Republic were registered in the central Control Centre for Intensive Care database as of 31 March 2021  This web-based application enabled continuous monitoring and decision-making during the mass surge of critical care from autumn 2020 to spring 2021  The Control Centre for Intensive Care has become an indispensable part of a set of online tools that are employed on a regular basis for crisis management at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34995207
7091,Rice is the staple food for about half of the world s population and mills are the essential processing link between farmers and consumers  making rice milling one of the most important agro-processing sectors globally  This paper assesses changes in rice and paddy prices  and processing margins during the COVID-19 pandemic shock through the lens of rice mills in Myanmar  Our data  collected through telephone surveys with a large number of medium- and large-scale rice millers in September 2020  reveal significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic  including transportation restrictions  employee lay-offs  and reduced operations relative to normal times  However  milling margins  and paddy and rice prices were mostly stable  showing only minor increases compared to 2019  Rice prices increased most for the varieties linked to export markets  though the gains were mostly passed through to farmers as higher paddy prices  Similarly  higher rice prices achieved by modern mills-due to extra processing-were mostly transmitted to producers  Our results also highlight the major importance of byproducts-broken rice and rice bran-sales to overall milling margins as byproduct sales allowed mill operators to sustain negative paddy-to-rice margins,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34898718
274,Objective  The worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease  COVID-19  has caused significant public health burdens and psychological dysfunctions  In this challenging time  adolescents require special care  The Persian version of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale  OCS  for adolescents was developed to screen for dysfunctional obsession associated with the coronavirus during the global pandemic  The structure and internal consistency of the OCS were established  Design and Measures  Although there are different language versions of the OCS  this is the first study to validate the psychometric properties of the OCS in Iranian adolescents  Seven hundred and nine students  369 girls  participated in the study  Demographic questions and the OCS were administered  Results  The findings provided support for the existence of a unidimensional structure that met the criteria for configural  metric  and full scalar invariance across gender  girls and boys   inhabitancy  urban and rural   and infection experience  infected and non-infected   The OCS is short and highly reliable measurement  However  further research is necessary to establish the validity of the scale in Iranian population  Conclusions  The development of such valid scales is an essential part of both research and practice during times of crisis  like a global pandemic  Diagnosis of pandemic related to obsessive thoughts in adolescents is needed as the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and as experts point out  it can be expected that the effects of the pandemic will be observed in the coming years  The Persian version makes it possible to conduct international comparative research on the anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002815

1755,The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked an intense debate about the hidden factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak  Several computational models have been proposed to inform effective social and healthcare strategies  Crucially  the predictive validity of these models often depends upon incorporating behavioral and social responses to infection  Among these tools  the analytic framework known as  dynamic causal modeling   DCM  has been applied to the COVID-19 pandemic  shedding new light on the factors underlying the dynamics of the outbreak  We have applied DCM to data from northern Italian regions  the first areas in Europe to contend with the outbreak  and analyzed the predictive validity of the model and also its suitability in highlighting the hidden factors governing the pandemic diffusion  By taking into account data from the beginning of the pandemic  the model could faithfully predict the dynamics of outbreak diffusion varying from region to region  The DCM appears to be a reliable tool to investigate the mechanisms governing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 to identify the containment and control strategies that could efficiently be used to counteract further waves of infection,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34976909
1978,CLIMATE CHANGE - THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME  COVID-19 pandemic aside  climate change is the ultimate challenge of our time  However  to date  there has been insufficient political thrust to make that much-needed climate action a reality  CLIMATE CHANGE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES  Infectious diseases represent only one facet of the threats arising from climate change  Direct impacts from climate change include the more frequent occurrence and increased magnitude of extreme weather events  as well as changing temperatures and precipitation patterns  For climate-sensitive infectious diseases  these changes implicate a shift in geographic and temporal distribution  seasonality  and transmission intensity  SIZING-UP THE PROBLEM  Susceptibility to deleterious effects of climate change is a net result not only of the interplay of environmental factors but also governed by human  societal  and economic factors  with social inequalities being a major determinant of vulnerability  The global South is already disproportionately affected by the climate crisis  The financial capacity to pursue adaptation options is also limited and unevenly distributed  CONCLUSIONS  Climate change-induced mortality and morbidity from both infectious and non-infectious diseases  amongst other adverse scenarios  is expected to rise globally in the future  The coming decade will be crucial for using all opportunities left to develop and implement adequate mitigation- and adaptation strategies,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34973415
292,COVID 19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus  SARS-CoV2 originated in China most probably of Bat origin  Multiepitopes vaccine would be useful in eliminating SARS-CoV2 infections as asymptomatic patients are in large numbers  In response to this  we utilized bioinformatic tools to develop an efficient vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV2  The designed vaccine has effective BCR and TCR epitopes screened from the sequence of S-protein of SARS-CoV2  Predicted BCR and TCR epitopes found antigenic  non-toxic and probably non-allergen  Modeled and the refined tertiary structure predicted as valid for further use  Protein-Protein interaction prediction of TLR2 4 and designed vaccine indicates promising binding  The designed multiepitope vaccine has induced cell-mediated and humoral immunity along with increased interferon-gamma response  Macrophages and dendritic cells were also found to increase upon the vaccine exposure  In silico codon optimization and cloning in expression vector indicates that the vaccine can be efficiently expressed in E  coli  In conclusion  the predicted vaccine is a good antigen  probable no allergen  and has the potential to induce cellular and humoral immunity,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35002585
1472,COVID-19 pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has infected hundreds of millions and caused over 5 million deaths to date  Although multiple vaccines are available  breakthrough infections occur especially by emerging variants  Effective therapeutic options such as monoclonal antibodies  mAbs  are still critical  Here  we report the development  cryo-EM structures  and functional analyses of mAbs that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern  By high-throughput single cell sequencing of B cells from spike receptor binding domain  RBD  immunized animals  we identified two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb clones that have single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity  and generated a bispecific antibody  Lead antibodies showed strong inhibitory activity against historical SARS-CoV-2 and several emerging variants of concern  We solved several cryo-EM structures at approximately 3 A resolution of these neutralizing antibodies in complex with prefusion spike trimer ectodomain  and revealed distinct epitopes  binding patterns  and conformations  The lead clones also showed potent efficacy in vivo against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings  We also generated and characterized a humanized antibody to facilitate translation and drug development  The humanized clone also has strong potency against both the original virus and the B 1 617 2 Delta variant  These mAbs expand the repertoire of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34981065
5799,PURPOSE  Health plan claims may provide complete longitudinal data for timely  real-world population-level COVID-19 assessment  However  these data often lack laboratory results  the standard for COVID-19 diagnosis  METHODS  We assessed the validity of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for identifying patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in U S  claims databases  compared to linked laboratory results  among six Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System data partners  two large national insurers  four integrated delivery systems  from February 20-October 17  2020  We identified patients hospitalized with COVID-19 according to five ICD-10-CM diagnosis code-based algorithms  which included combinations of codes U07 1  B97 29  general coronavirus codes  and diagnosis codes for severe symptoms  We calculated the positive predictive value  PPV  and sensitivity of each algorithm relative to laboratory test results  We stratified results by data source type and across three time periods  February 20-March 31  Time A   April 1-30  Time B   May 1-October 17  Time C   RESULTS  The five algorithms identified between 34 806 and 47 293 patients across the study periods  23  with known laboratory results contributed to PPV calculations  PPVs were high and similar across algorithms  PPV of U07 1 alone was stable around 93  for integrated delivery systems  but declined over time from 93  to 70  among national insurers  Overall PPV of U07 1 across all data partners was 94 1   95  CI  92 3 -95 5   in Time A and 81 2   95  CI  80 1 -82 2   in Time C  Sensitivity was consistent across algorithms and over time  at 94 9   95  CI  94 2 -95 5    CONCLUSION  Our results support the use of code U07 1 to identify hospitalized COVID-19 patients in U S  claims data,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913208
7324,BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019  COVID-19  pandemic has affected people in various ways  including restricting their mobility and depriving them of exercise opportunities  Such circumstances can trigger locomotor deterioration and impairment  which is known as locomotive syndrome  The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of locomotive syndrome in the pandemic and to identify its risk factors  Methods  This was a multicenter questionnaire survey performed between 1 November 2020 and 31 December 2020 in Japan  Patients who visited the orthopedics clinic were asked to answer a questionnaire about their symptoms  exercise habits  and locomotor function at two time points  namely  pre-pandemic and post-second wave  current   The incidence of locomotive syndrome in the COVID-19 pandemic was investigated  Additionally  multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome during the pandemic  Results  A total of 2829 patients were enrolled in this study  average age  61 1   - 17 1 years  1532 women   The prevalence of locomotive syndrome was 30  pre-pandemic  which increased significantly to 50  intra-pandemic  Among the patients with no symptoms of locomotive syndrome  30  developed it in the wake of the pandemic  In the multinomial logistic regression analysis  older age  deteriorated or newly occurring symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders  complaints about the spine or hip knee joints  and no or decreased exercise habits were independent risk factors for developing locomotive syndrome  Conclusions  The prevalence of locomotive syndrome in patients with musculoskeletal disorders has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic  In addition to age  locomotor symptoms  especially spine or hip knee joint complaints  and exercise habits were associated with the development of locomotive syndrome  Although the control of infection is a priority  the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders and ensuring exercise habits are also essential issues to address during a pandemic such as COVID-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34894867
3334,We evaluated humoral immune-response elicited by Sputnik-V by measuring anti-Spike  S  IgG antibodies  Abs  and neutralizing antibodies  NAb  prior to  14 and 42 days after-vaccination  The safety and disease rates among vaccinated individuals were also evaluated  Since SARS-CoV-2 lineage P 1 is rapidly spreading in Argentina  virus-neutralizing activity of Sputnik-V-elicited and infection-elicited NAb faced to P 1 were also assessed  A total of 285 participants were recruited  all reported good tolerance  without any severe adverse event  Nine COVID-19 cases were confirmed in fully vaccinated individuals and viable P 1 variant was successfully isolated from one of them  At day 42  99 65  of the individuals had anti-S IgG  however  23 15  had not detectable NAbs  Significantly higher neutralization potency against WT compared to P 1  p < 0 001  was observed  Some samples failed to neutralize P 1  mainly among vaccinated-nasmall yi  Ukrainianve subjects  however  no significant differences were observed among previously infected-vaccinated individuals  Our results corroborated that Sputnik-V is safe and induces an efficient humoral immune response  although not all immunized subjects develop Nabs  Herein  we show for the first time  evidence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 shedding from Sputnik-V fully vaccinated individuals  by the isolation of viable virus from the nasopharyngeal swab of one participant of our study  139 days after receiving the second dose  Thereby  we provide evidence indicating that the vaccine might avoid severe forms of COVID-19 but does not prevent infection nor prevents transmission from a fully vaccinated individual,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34953609
2835,Given the emergence of breakthrough infections  new variants  and concerns of waning immunity from the primary COVID-19 vaccines  booster shots emerged as a viable option to shore-up protection against COVID-19  Following the recent authorization of vaccine boosters among vulnerable Americans  this study aims to assess COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitancy and its associated factors in a nationally representative sample  A web-based 48-item psychometric valid survey was used to measure vaccine literacy  vaccine confidence  trust  and general attitudes towards vaccines  Data were analyzed through Chi-square  with a post hoc contingency table analysis  and independent-sample t- Welch tests  Among 2138 participants  nearly 62  intended to take booster doses and the remaining were COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitant  The vaccine-booster-hesitant group was more likely to be unvaccinated  62 6  vs  12 9   and did not intend to have their children vaccinated  86 1  vs  27 5   compared to their non-hesitant counterparts  A significantly higher proportion of booster dose hesitant individuals had very little to no trust in the COVID-19 vaccine information given by public health government agencies  55  vs  12   compared to non-hesitant ones  The mean scores of vaccine confidence index and vaccine literacy were lower among the hesitant group compared to the non-hesitant group  Compared to the non-hesitant group  vaccine hesitant participants were single or never married  41 8  vs  28 7    less educated  and living in a southern region of the nation  40 9  vs  33 3    These findings underscore the need of developing effective communication strategies emphasizing vaccine science in ways that are accessible to individuals with lower levels of education and vaccine literacy to increase vaccination uptake,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960170
2249,BACKGROUND  During the COVID-19 pandemic  nursing students have had a key role in supporting the healthcare sector  They can join healthcare professionals in clinical practice or provide information to increase citizens  levels of knowledge and their compliance with the restriction measures  The study aimed to develop and validate a tool to measure knowledge of and attitudes toward COVID-19 among nursing students in Greece  METHODS  A questionnaire was developed through theoretical research and expert consultation  A cross-sectional study was conducted among 348 undergraduate nursing students of the Department of Nursing  Hellenic Mediterranean University  recruited by convenient sampling  Validity and reliability were analyzed  RESULTS  The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0 84  indicating that the sample size was adequate for factor analysis  In addition  the p-value for Bartlett s test of sphericity was <0 001  denoting that the correlation matrix was suitable for factor analysis  The construct validity of the questionnaire was determined through exploratory factor analysis  EFA   which revealed that 16 items lead to four factors  knowledge  attitude toward restriction measures  compliance with them  and volunteering  One of the key findings of this study was that participants preferred to receive information from valid sources rather than social media during the crucial period of the  infodemic   CONCLUSIONS  The questionnaire was shown to have satisfying psychometric properties and  therefore  can be used as a tool in future research in the area of nursing students  knowledge  attitudes  compliance  and volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34968353
5456,OBJECTIVES  This paper analyzes results from focus groups held with women physicians in British Columbia which explored questions around how gender norms and roles influenced their experiences during COVID-19  METHODS  Four virtual focus groups were organized between July and September 2020  Participants  n   27  were voluntarily recruited  Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis  RESULTS  In addition to the COVID-19-related changes experienced across the profession  women physicians faced distinct challenges related to an increase in unpaid care responsibilities  and often felt excluded from  and occasionally dismissed by  leadership  Women leaders often felt their contributions were unrecognized and undervalued  Participants drew strength from other women leaders  peer networks  and professional support  but these strategies were limited by unpaid care and emotional labour demands  which were identified as increasing risk of burnout  DISCUSSION  Even though women physicians hold a degree of relative privilege  unpaid care work and gender norms contribute to distinct secondary effects of COVID-19  Women physicians link these to pre-pandemic assumptions  within families and communities  that women would absorb care deficits at their own cost  Health system leadership continues to reflect a masculine normative experience wherein the personal and professional are separated  and which devalues the emotional labour often associated with feminine leadership  The strategies participants employed to address negative impacts  while demonstrating resourcefulness and peer support  reflect individualistic responses to social-structural challenges  There is a need for greater recognition of women s contributions at home and work  increased representation in decision-making  and practical supports such as childcare and counselling,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34919212
76,The outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS-CoV-2  in December 2019 in Wuhan challenges pediatric oncologists in an unexpected way  We provide a comprehensive overview  which systematically summarizes and grades evidence  QoE  on SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric cancer patients at 1 5 years of pandemic  A systematic literature search in PubMed combined with an additional exploratory literature review in other international databases was conducted to identify studies on children  aged < 18 years  with a malignant disease and COVID-19 infections  In total  45 reports on 1003 pediatric cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified out of 1397 reports analyzed  The clinical course of COVID-19 was reported mild or moderate in 358 patients  41 7    whereas 11 1  of patients showed severe COVID-19  In 12 7  of patients  chemotherapy was postponed  whereas 19  of patients with different underlying malignancies received chemotherapy during SARS-CoV-2 infection  Twenty-five patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections died  potentially related to COVID-19 Conclusion  Despite a favorable COVID-19 outcome in most pediatric cancer patients  the morbidity is reported higher than in children without comorbidities  However  no severe COVID-19 complications were associated to the continuation of chemotherapy in some cohort studies and reports on two patients  Therefore  the risk of cancer progress or relapse due to interruption of chemotherapy has carefully to be weighed against the risk of severe COVID-19 disease with potentially fatal outcome  What is Known    Most of pediatric patients with malignant diseases show an asymptomatic  mild or moderate clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection    Current need for a basis for decision-making  whether to stop or interrupt cancer treatment in a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2  and when to continue chemotherapy  What is New    Review results comprising over 1000 pediatric COVID-19 cancer patients confirm mild courses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in most patients but also show the attributable mortality is at least 10 times higher compared to reports on hospitalized children without comorbidities    Review identifies that chemotherapy was continued despite SARS-CoV-2 positivity in 18  of patients with individual chemotherapy modification according to the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and existing comorbidities  On this basis  no severe COVID-19 complications were associated to the continuation of chemotherapy in several cohort studies and two case reports,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35006377
2698,BACKGROUND  Patients with multiple myeloma  MM  were excluded from the original SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine trials  which may influence vaccine hesitancy in this population  We prospectively characterized the safety and immunogenicity of two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 44 patients with MM  who underwent vaccination from 12 17 2020 to 3 18 2021  RESULTS  Rates adverse reactions were low and consistent with those documented in vaccine trials  Among those on MM therapy  93  developed detectable anti-receptor binding domain  RBD  antibodies after dose 2  while 94  of patients not on MM therapy seroconverted  CONCLUSIONS  Two-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is mildly reactogenic and leads to high rates of seroconversion in patients with MM  These findings can provide reassurance to MM patients who are hesitant to receive SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34961488

7688,Introduction  During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020  the German government implemented legal restrictions to avoid the overloading of intensive care units by patients with COVID-19  The influence of these effects on diagnosis and treatment of cancer in Germany is largely unknown  Methods  To evaluate the effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on tumor board presentations in a high-volume tertiary referral center  the German Comprehensive Cancer Center NCT UCC Dresden   we compared the number of presentations of gastrointestinal tumors stratified by tumor entity  tumor stage  and treatment intention during the pandemic to the respective data from previous years  Results  The number of presentations decreased by 3 2   95  CI -8 8  2 7  during the COVID year 2020 compared with the pre-COVID year 2019  During the first shutdown  March-May 2020  the total number of presentations was 9 4   -18 7  1  less than during March-May 2019  This decrease was significant for curable cases of esophageal cancer  N   37  25 5   -41 8  -4 4   and colon cancer  N   36  17 5   -32 6  1 1   as well as for all cases of biliary tract cancer  N   26  50   -69 9  -15   during the first shutdown from March 2020 to May 2020  Conclusion  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation of oncological patients in a CCC in Germany was considerable and should be taken into account when making decisions regarding future pandemics,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34888284
6959,Mutual aid groups have flourished during the Covid-19 pandemic  However  a major challenge is sustaining such groups  which tend to decline following the initial upsurge immediately after emergencies  The present study investigates one possible motivation for continued participation  the well-being benefits associated with psychological membership of groups  as suggested by the  social cure  approach  Interviews were conducted with 11 volunteers in a mutual aid group organized by ACORN  a community union and anti-poverty campaigning organization  Through qualitative analysis  we show that participation provided well-being in different ways  positive emotional experiences  increased engagement in life  improved social relationships  and greater sense of control  Participants also reported some negative emotional experiences  While all interviewees experienced benefits from participation  those who viewed their participation through a political lens were able to experience additional benefits such as feelings of empowerment  Moreover  the benefits conferred by a shared political identity appeared to be qualitatively different from the benefits conferred by other forms of shared identity  The interview data is used to hypothesize an overall process by which participants may come to attain a political identity via mutual aid  These findings have implications for how such groups retain their members and how authorities support these groups,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34899075
1650,PURPOSE  In March 2020  many state  local  and national governments declared various states of emergencies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  In Massachusetts  where our multidisciplinary pediatric feeding clinic is located  the governor declared of a state of emergency encouraging social distancing  and simultaneously signed an order establishing reimbursement parity for telehealth visits to in-office traditional visits by both commercial and state health insurers  This presented a challenge and an opportunity for our multidisciplinary program for children with pediatric feeding disorders embedded in a large academic children s hospital  In this paper we aim to provide a roadmap for rapid implementation of telehealth practice without a reliance on in-person care in a multidisciplinary pediatric feeding clinic  Description  Within a week  the program pivoted from solely in-person care to 100  telehealth services for both new and established patients  Through this transition  the program encountered several challenges with technology  scheduling  licensing  and concerns for reinforcing pre-existing healthcare disparities  ASSESSMENT  The program quickly overcame many of these challenges and found telehealth to offer benefits to patients such as improved coordination of care with other agencies  reduced appointment times  and reduced travel time and travel cost  Even with a reduction in the number of patients seen per clinic due to the manner in which telehealth was implemented  there was an increase in the number of visits completed with a slight reduction in the no-show rate  Additionally  providers in the program are better able to evaluate feeding practices in the home and understand many of the barriers families may face in implementing interventions  While telehealth does have some challenges  it can help to improve access  communication  and may increase patient satisfaction for children who require multidisciplinary care for their pediatric feeding disorder  CONCLUSION  Our hope is that billing parity for telehealth will continue to be supported by insurance companies and state governments throughout the remainder of this pandemic  and far beyond,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34978018
6475,COVID-19 has become a public health concern around the world  The frequency of N440K variant was higher during the second wave in South India  The mutation was observed in the Receptor Binding Domain region  RBD  of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2  SARS-CoV-2  spike  S  protein  The binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2-Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2  ACE-2  plays a major role in the transmission and severity of the disease  To understand the binding affinity of the wild and mutant SARS-CoV-2 S with ACE2  molecular modeling studies were carried out  We discovered that the wild SARS-CoV-2 S RBD-ACE-2 complex has a high binding affinity and stability than that of the mutant  The N440K strain escapes from antibody neutralization  which might increase reinfection and decrease vaccine efficiency  To find a potential inhibitor against mutant N440K SARS-CoV-2  a virtual screening process was carried out and found ZINC169293961  ZINC409421825 and ZINC22060839 as the best binding energy compounds  Communicated by Ramaswamy H  Sarma,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904526

2515,Introduction  Hyperleukocytosis  an infrequent presentation of new-onset leukemia  is a medical emergency requiring prompt recognition and treatment  It can include altered mental status  fever  critical electrolyte derangements  and coagulopathies  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic  this simulation was created as a telesimulation in order to adhere to mandatory physical distancing guidelines while addressing learning objectives  Methods  This simulation was designed for pediatric emergency medicine fellows and featured a pediatric patient presenting with fever  altered mental status  and respiratory distress  After an initial assessment and appropriate workup  the patient developed tumor lysis syndrome  coagulopathies  and new-onset neurologic changes requiring appropriate interventions  A debriefing guide and participant evaluation form were utilized  Results  This telesimulation was implemented at five different institutions  with evaluation surveys completed by 22 pediatric emergency medicine fellows  The scenario was rated on a 5-point Likert scale  1   strongly disagree  5   strongly agree  and was generally well received  with participants rating the simulation as effective in teaching the recognition  M   4 8  and management  M   4 6  of hyperleukocytosis  Participants felt that virtual telesimulation was effective compared to other distance learning methods  M   3 9   Discussion  This simulation-based curriculum allows learners to practice identifying and managing hyperleukocytosis  We found that it was well received in both in-person and virtual formats,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34963902
852,Purpose  Literature shows that it is a paradox whether employees can achieve performance in telework  especially during COVID-19  Our aim is to clarify the relationship between telework and employees  job performance through a moderated mediation model  Methods  This study employed two-wave surveys with the aim of reducing the potential risk of common method bias  The 1309 participants of the survey were mainly employees who used telework during COVID-19  and they were mostly in positions such as product design and scheme planning  SEM was used to test the hypotheses  Results  Results from two-wave surveys of 1309 Chinese employees indicated that telework positively influenced job performance via job crafting  That is  job crafting played a mediating role between telework and job performance  And performance-prove goal orientation positively moderated the relationship between telework and job crafting but performance-avoid goal orientation negatively moderated the relationship between them  Conclusion  This study shows that telework can improve job performance through job crafting in COVID-19  in response to the paradox implied in the literature  In addition  we use COR theory to explain the role of performance goal orientation and job crafting in telework  We add these variables to the theoretical framework of COR theory  thereby enriching the theoretical research from the COR theory perspective,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34992479
9115,The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme economic fluctuations  However  the magnitude of the economic cost of this extreme event remains challenging to quantify  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy is estimated through firm-level electricity consumption data from Hunan province  China  Specifically  a difference-in-differences  DID  model was employed to estimate the real economic costs  The results indicate that electricity consumption in Hunan Province dropped by 27 8  during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic  Manufacturing and the transportation industry suffered the most severe declines  Electricity consumption began to recover after the virus was controlled  We suggest that government departments should take full measures to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks and associated economic impacts  in conjunction with preparing for economic recovery  deploying targeted measures to support different industries in response to the heterogeneity COVID-19 pandemic impacts  The COVID-19 has changed people s living habits and brought a new direction  the Internet industry  of economic growth  Hunan Province needs to accelerate the digital empowerment of traditional industries  develop the Internet  5G technology  and new digital infrastructure to offset the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  Electricity consumption is an applicable index in estimate the real economic cost of extreme events,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34866706
4359,Most babies in France are fed with infant formula and then commercial complementary foods  many of which are ultra-processed and harmful to health  Internationally  there is opposition by the baby food industry to the introduction of public health policies that would limit the marketing and consumption of such products  Our aim was to identify the key baby food industry actors  describe their history and corporate political activity  CPA  in France  We sourced publicly available information  which we triangulated with data from 10 semi-structured interviews  Qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken simultaneously to data collection  guided by an existing classification of the CPA of the food industry  The baby food industry in France has shaped the science on infant and young child nutrition and nurtured long-established relationships with health professionals  This corporate science and these relationships helped baby food companies to portray themselves as experts on child-related topics  The baby food industry has also engaged with a broad range of civil society organisations  particularly through the concept of the first 1000 days of life  and during the covid-19 pandemic  We found evidence  although limited  that the baby food industry directly lobbied the French government  Since its early development in France in the 19th century  the baby food industry used its CPA to promote its products and protect and sustain its market  Our findings can be used to recognise  anticipate and address the CPA of this industry  and to minimise any negative influence it may have on babies  and mother s health,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34935291
9749,SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR  the gold standard for diagnostic testing  may not be readily available or logistically applicable for routine COVID-19 testing in many rural communities in the United States  In this validation study  we compared the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Test Ag Card with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in 214 participants who sought COVID-19 testing from a local public health district in Idaho  USA  The median age of participants was 35 and 82 7  were symptomatic  Thirty-seven participants  17 3   had positive RT-PCR results  Results between the two tests were 94 4  concordant  The sensitivity of the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Test Ag Card was 67 6   95  CI  50 2-81 9    and the specificity was 100 0   95  CI  97 9-100 0    The positive predictive value  PPV  for the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Test Ag Card was 100 0   95  CI  86 2-100 0    and the negative predictive value  NPV  was 93 6   95  CI  89 1-96 6    Although the sensitivity of BinaxNOW COVID-19 Test Ag Card was lower than RT-PCR  rapid results and high specificity support its use for early detection of COVID-19  especially in settings where SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is not readily available  Rapid antigen tests  such as the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Test Ag Card  may be a more convenient tool in quickly identifying and preventing COVID-19 transmission  especially in rural settings,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34855887
